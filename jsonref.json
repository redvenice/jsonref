His first work, The Relapse: Or Virtue in Danger, was a huge success.After penning several other pieces over the next few years, he switched career in 1702 and became an architect.His first design was Castle Howard in Yorkshire, for Lord Carlisle. He would go on to design the Queen’s Theatre (or Opera House) in the Haymarket in 1703.Then, in 1705, John Churchill, 1st duke of Marlborough, asked him to design the palace at Woodstock, Oxfordshire - Blenheim Palace.There followed several more country houses in the style of castles - such as Kimbolton Castle in Huntingdon (1707–10) and Kings Weston in Gloucestershire (now in Bristol c. 1710–14). But Blenheim remains his most famous work.                                                     The jewel in the crown of this home is a private roof terrace which enjoys sweeping views of the Greenwich observatory and nearby Royal Park. Vanbrugh Castle, believed to have been modelled on the French Bastille, was built in 1718 by highly acclaimed architect Sir John Vanbrugh, who lived there with his wife Henrietta Maria Yarborough until his death aged 62 in 1726.The  politically radical Vanbrugh was imprisoned in the Bastille in his youth for espionage.He was also involved in a plot to overthrow James II and put William III on the throne, to protect English parliamentary democracy. Sir John is best known as the designer of UNESCO World Heritage Site Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire and Castle Howard in North Yorkshire.Vanbrugh Castle has since been used as an RAF school for the sons of servicemen killed in the World Wars but was restored and refurbished by the Blackheath Preservation Trust for luxury living space.The apartment boasts four bedrooms, a modern kitchen, and a living and dining room consisting of solid wood doors and large picturesque windows.The master bedroom has a dressing room and a bathroom adjacent to it, while on the second floor lies the three other neat-looking bedrooms.The basement has a utility room and large cellar while outside there is an annex along with two off-street parking spaces.Paul Kirby from Fine \u0026amp Country said: \u0027Vanbrugh Castle presents a fantastic opportunity for someone to live in a historic castle while having all the benefits of London on the doorstep.\u0027The most impressive feature of the four-storey household is the expansive private roof terrace that boasts far-reaching views of the London skyline.\u0027Because the property sits upon a hilltop, you overlook the lush communal gardens, the wonderful Greenwich observatory and the nearby Royal Park.\u0027We think the property would suit a family who want the best of London living in a welcoming and friendly location.\u0027           The castle\u0027s design is believed to have been inspired by the Bastille, where the politically radical Vanbrugh was imprisoned in his youth for espionage  Paul Kirby from Fine \u0026amp Country said: \u0027Vanbrugh Castle presents a fantastic opportunity for someone to live in a historic castle while having all the benefits of London on the doorstep\u0027          Vanbrugh Castle has since been used as an RAF school for the sons of servicemen killed in the World Wars but was restored and refurbished by the Blackheath Preservation Trust for luxury living space          After penning several comedies following his imprisonment,  Sir John switched career in 1702 and became an architect          The basement has a utility room and large cellar while outside there is an annex along with two off-street parking spaces"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/23/4D2B0AD000000578-0-image-m-14_1528843303013.jpg","title":"Would FIVE stone lose six months 10 000","story":"A controversial competition is offering a member of the public the chance to earn £10,000 if they agree to put on five stone and lose it again in six months (Pictured: The Bark advert)It is being run by website Bark.com, which connects customers with local service professionals.

His first work, The Relapse: Or Virtue in Danger, was a huge success.After penning several other pieces over the next few years, he switched career in 1702 and became an architect.His first design was Castle Howard in Yorkshire, for Lord Carlisle. He would go on to design the Queen’s Theatre (or Opera House) in the Haymarket in 1703.Then, in 1705, John Churchill, 1st duke of Marlborough, asked him to design the palace at Woodstock, Oxfordshire - Blenheim Palace.There followed several more country houses in the style of castles - such as Kimbolton Castle in Huntingdon (1707–10) and Kings Weston in Gloucestershire (now in Bristol c. 1710–14). But Blenheim remains his most famous work.                                                     The jewel in the crown of this home is a private roof terrace which enjoys sweeping views of the Greenwich observatory and nearby Royal Park. Vanbrugh Castle, believed to have been modelled on the French Bastille, was built in 1718 by highly acclaimed architect Sir John Vanbrugh, who lived there with his wife Henrietta Maria Yarborough until his death aged 62 in 1726.The  politically radical Vanbrugh was imprisoned in the Bastille in his youth for espionage.He was also involved in a plot to overthrow James II and put William III on the throne, to protect English parliamentary democracy. Sir John is best known as the designer of UNESCO World Heritage Site Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire and Castle Howard in North Yorkshire.Vanbrugh Castle has since been used as an RAF school for the sons of servicemen killed in the World Wars but was restored and refurbished by the Blackheath Preservation Trust for luxury living space.The apartment boasts four bedrooms, a modern kitchen, and a living and dining room consisting of solid wood doors and large picturesque windows.The master bedroom has a dressing room and a bathroom adjacent to it, while on the second floor lies the three other neat-looking bedrooms.The basement has a utility room and large cellar while outside there is an annex along with two off-street parking spaces.Paul Kirby from Fine \u0026amp Country said: \u0027Vanbrugh Castle presents a fantastic opportunity for someone to live in a historic castle while having all the benefits of London on the doorstep.\u0027The most impressive feature of the four-storey household is the expansive private roof terrace that boasts far-reaching views of the London skyline.\u0027Because the property sits upon a hilltop, you overlook the lush communal gardens, the wonderful Greenwich observatory and the nearby Royal Park.\u0027We think the property would suit a family who want the best of London living in a welcoming and friendly location.\u0027           The castle\u0027s design is believed to have been inspired by the Bastille, where the politically radical Vanbrugh was imprisoned in his youth for espionage  Paul Kirby from Fine \u0026amp Country said: \u0027Vanbrugh Castle presents a fantastic opportunity for someone to live in a historic castle while having all the benefits of London on the doorstep\u0027          Vanbrugh Castle has since been used as an RAF school for the sons of servicemen killed in the World Wars but was restored and refurbished by the Blackheath Preservation Trust for luxury living space          After penning several comedies following his imprisonment,  Sir John switched career in 1702 and became an architect          The basement has a utility room and large cellar while outside there is an annex along with two off-street parking spaces"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/23/4D2B0AD000000578-0-image-m-14_1528843303013.jpg","title":"Would FIVE stone lose six months 10 000","story":"A controversial competition is offering a member of the public the chance to earn £10,000 if they agree to put on five stone and lose it again in six months (Pictured: The Bark advert)It is being run by website Bark.com, which connects customers with local service professionals.

There wouldn’t be a space for female humour if Nancy Mitford hadn’t carved it out with a scalpel. There wouldn’t be a thirst for workplace romances if Charlotte Brontë hadn’t drawn up the template for them. My first book was written by telling all these women – and many others – to turn around so I could smooth my paper between their shoulder blades. And yet, all of my favourite authors went through a period of lostness before they were picked up by some gutsy publisher. In many cases, that publisher was Virago: in 1978, Virago Modern Classics set out to publish either women who were out of print, or whose work didn’t get the respect it deserved, and changed the literary landscape in the process. There are writers who are beloved within their niche, who have thriving fanbases, but still might not have a single book in Waterstones. Are they lost? Lost until someone finds them, I guess. But lost, as a status, is a transient one. The following books have all endured some kind of success, some kind of loss, and at least a few of them will have you saying: “What do you mean, lost? I saw that in an airport WH Smith!” To this, I have no answer. These are simply the books that I want to push into people’s hands, that they might not find elsewhere. The books, you’ll realise, that your library was lost without.1. Kindred by Octavia ButlerThis is often cited as the first science fiction published by a black woman, but you don’t need to put Kindred in the category of “firsts” to find it brilliant. It follows 26-year-old Dana, a black woman moving in with her white boyfriend, who is periodically sent back in time to a pre-civil war Maryland plantation. Here, she’s forced to protect her distant white relatives from destruction while they abuse her and other slaves. It is the marker you should judge all other time-travelling narratives by.2. Home Cooking by Laurie ColwinI have limited interest in adjectives, and food writing is full of them. Even good food writing I find hard going. Or at least, I did, until someone gifted me this slim little paperback. It’s full of gross references to 80s food, such as creamed spinach. Regardless, it’s a tragicomic exploration of life and friendship through food, something every food writer wants to achieve, but Colwin truly pulled out of the bag.3. Are You Somebody? by Nuala O’Faolain I had always wondered, when reading Nora Ephron, if Ireland ever had an equivalent. Someone witty and female who would not only call a spade a spade but acknowledge the blade, the handle and the funny way it sticks out of the earth. Recently, I discovered that person in Nuala O’Faolain. Her memoir Are You Somebody? is equal parts hilarious, tragic and wonderfully gossipy. “Years after I was in Hull, Philip Larkin apologised. ‘I was asked to look out for you,’ he said. ‘But I’m afraid I couldn’t be bothered.’”4. Passing by Nella LarsenPassing is one of those books you’re either obsessed with, or have never heard of. A gem of the Harlem Renaissance, it follows two black women, the married Irene and the beautiful Clare, who has committed to a life of “passing” as white and is now homesick for the culture she abandoned.There were thousands of “tragic mulatto” narratives being peddled in Larsen’s day, and most of them had a very similar arc: light-skinned black girl tries to “become white”, fails, is rejected by both cultures and dies tragically. Most of them are worth leaving in the cultural dust. Passing both follows the genre and subverts it completely, its use of Irene as narrator making it a compelling psychological drama as well as an investigation of race and class in Harlem in the early 20th century. 5. Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady by Florence KingRepublican, southern, and gay, King was the definition of an equal-opportunities hater. She was the Dorothy Parker of the American south, and because Dorothy Parker figures are much better suited to chic cocktail bars than they are to sweltering wraparound porches, she has largely flown under the radar. In her own words, “even my different drummer had a different drummer”.6. One Pair of Feet by Monica DickensThis wartime nurse may have been a descendant of Charles Dickens, but she had very little interest in feigning compassion at the discomfort of others. This reads more like a diary than a memoir, with none of the usual ego and self-preservation of autobiography.7. Dolly City by Orly Castel-BloomWhen a book’s very first page includes the butchering and eating of a pet goldfish, you know you’re in for a bumpy ride. Baby stealing, grave-digging, pet-eating, Holocaust jokes – you name it, this Tel Aviv nightmare has it. A cult classic about motherhood and, in particular, Jewish motherhood, Dolly City is horrifyingly dark yet ceaselessly comic.8. Angel by Elizabeth Taylor It took me becoming a Virago author to finally understand that there are two very different Elizabeth Taylors. Angel is the story of a teenage girl with a preternatural taste for melodrama who ends up writing a bestseller whose success baffles even her publishers. You can’t help but think that it’s a sly wink from Taylor, who wrote a score of books and dozens of short stories, toward the industry as a whole.9. The Young Visiters by Daisy Ashford What better way to fill the ninth spot on this list that with an author who was actually nine when she wrote her book? What’s fascinating about the story is that, while it was written by a child, it is definitely not a children’s book. It’s a serious society novel, and takes itself hugely seriously. It ends up being an unwitting parody not only of literature, but of adults as a class of people.“Bring three glasses of champaigne commanded the prince and some ices he added majestikally. The goods appeared as if by majic and the prince drew out a cigar case and passed it round.“One grows weary of Court Life he remarked.“Ah yes agreed the earl.”10. The Brontës Went to Woolworths by Rachel Ferguson “I was so rasped with life that I hit Goldsmith’s tomb with my umbrella. I said, ‘I’d give five pounds if somebody’d come along and tell us both how clever we are.’”At a certain point, you’re going to run out of Mitford novels to reread. Fear not, good sister, because if wry, absurd novels about posh sisters are your drugs of choice, this is your crack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e6ed78b6bd58cfe2044f00607edf09fda363795/0_206_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e98a5982221eca345029049604d74e","title":"pimlico plumbers gig economy heating engineer wins claim against pimlico plumbers","story":"Supreme court’s judgment sets precedent and is likely to influence other legal battles over employment statusA heating engineer has won his claim against Pimlico Plumbers, establishing that he was a worker and not self-employed in a unanimous decision by the UK’s highest court that will set a clear precedent for other gig economy disputes.The supreme court’s judgment is likely to influence the outcome of protracted legal battles such as those involving the cab firms Uber and Addison Lee, which are in dispute with their drivers over their employment status.Pimlico Plumbers, which lost at every stage of the legal dispute, had appealed to the UK’s highest court, arguing that those it sends out to repair leaking pipes and malfunctioning dishwashers are self-employed and not “workers”. Workers do not enjoy the full range of employment protection rights given to full-time staff but are entitled to significant elements such as holiday pay.The claim was brought by Gary Smith, from Kent, who worked for Pimlico Plumbers as a plumber and heating engineer for six years until 2011, when he suffered a heart attack. He claimed that his subsequent request for a three-day week was rejected, the Pimlico Plumbers van he rented was taken away and he was dismissed. The firm disputed Smith’s assertion that he was sacked because he wanted to work fewer days.The judgment acknowledged that there were some aspects of Smith’s conditions that resembled self-employment, such as the entitlement to refuse work, but other aspects of the contract with Pimlico Plumbers “betrayed a grip on his economy inconsistent with his being a truly independent contractor”. These included that he wore a branded uniform, had a tracker in his branded van and carried an identity card. His contract made reference to “wages”, “gross misconduct” and “dismissal”. Outside the court, Charlie Mullins, the founder of Pimlico Plumbers, said he was considering taking an appeal against the decision to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.“It’s not over yet,” Mullins said. “We are going to take it to the next stage if we can and prove this chap was self-employed. At the worst, we will go back to the tribunal and fight it.“Around 4.8 million subcontractors in the UK will be affected by this decision. The government needs to step in and provide clarity to the employment laws.”Smith said he was pleased with the outcome. “It’s a great weight off my shoulders. It’s been like carrying around a giant rucksack on my shoulders,” he said. “I will celebrate with a stiff drink. It feels good. It’s been an arduous seven-year battle. I’m now a properly self-employed plumber.” The Equality and Human Rights Commission has funded Smith’s case since 2015. Its chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: “If you wear the uniform, if you drive the branded vehicle, if you only work for one business, you are employed. That means you are entitled to the appropriate protections and adjustments which go with the job, to enable you to work safely and productively. Everyone has the right to a healthy working environment and to that end businesses need to recognise their duties to their workers. This is one of the biggest decisions ever made by the courts on workers’ rights. Thousands of workers like Gary Smith could now find themselves with the added security of benefits like sick pay and holiday pay.” Susannah Kintish, an employment specialist at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, said: “This judgment does not lay down any new principles of law around worker status. Instead, all eyes will be on the government as businesses await legislation on how to categorise their workforce – something which could still be a matter of years away. In the meantime, the gig economy continues to evolve and existing employment law is rendered increasingly unfit for purpose. “The supreme court justices have made it clear that this judgment is very specific to the unique facts of the case. It will therefore do little to stem the flow of litigation around worker status, which, in the absence of any overarching principles, will need to be determined on the specific circumstances of each case.”Sean Nesbitt, a partner and employment specialist at the law firm Taylor Wessing, said: “It is clear from this decision that the supreme court wants to manage the flood of cases relating to employment status. It also reinforces the weight of the decision made by the master of the rolls in the original court of appeal judgment. In essence, this decision will encourage him in other litigation, especially the upcoming Uber appeal (October 2018). It will make it fundamentally easier to set out a coherent body of case law that can be applied by people and organisations in their own dealings to determine employment status.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e86a98c539cec29e988f2bde5a5c954cdb117cd/0_186_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79ec5a68bf12d101a93c98d96a1d97b8","title":"uk inflation defies expectations by holding steady at 24","story":"UK inflation unexpectedly stayed at a one-year low last month, despite average petrol prices rising to the highest level for almost four years. Statisticians said the falling cost of computer games, sweets and chocolate helped to offset the rising price of petrol, as British motorists came under growing financial pressure. The ONS said the average price of petrol rose by 4.6 pence a litre between April and May to 125.3 pence last month – the highest level since October 2014. While the surprise inflation reading may comfort hard-pressed consumers, hit by a sharp increase in living costs since the EU referendum, the latest snapshot from the ONS could add to pressure on the Bank of England to delay raising interest rates as the UK economy falters. Weak economic growth deterred the central bank from raising the cost of borrowing last month.  Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The case for higher interest rates is falling further away. Instead of an autumn rate rise, we will need an autumn boost in the budget to get the economy moving and wages rising faster.”Coming at a time of weak economic data, with Britain close to the bottom of the G7 growth league, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and former member of the Bank’s rate-setting committee, said the UK seemed to be in a period of stagflation – a term used by economists to describe low levels of growth coupled with high inflation. Inflation sticking stubbornly above target could push Threadneedle Street to raise the cost of borrowing, he said, adding: “The combination of Brexit and the Bank’s reluctance to raise interest rates is creating a very uncomfortable position for the UK economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9e1601e1339258d545f363b36b60f208d56022/0_56_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f83b32bef74fb0b74817e45bbea4b32","title":"wetherspoons to sell more non eu drinks in run up to brexit","story":"Pub chain’s pro-Brexit chairman says new sourcing will save customers moneyPub chain JD Wetherspoon is to sell more drinks from the UK and non-EU brewers in the run-up to Brexit.Champagne and wheat beers produced in France and Germany will be replaced.

Like so many others, I felt a need to identify with the city and its people, to respond in some way that keyed into this desire for solidarity.I decided to immerse myself in the city by walking the streets and building an archive of photographs. With the edges of Manchester’s city centre in the throes of breakneck redevelopment that is seeing the construction of dozens of high-rise luxury apartment blocks, I wanted to find what had endured beyond this bubble of speculative building – and to find something that might counter it.Tony Walsh’s 2012 poem This is the Place – read to a crowd of thousands the day after the attack – spoke passionately of Manchester as a city with a distinct identity that embraced international clout (music and football) and defiant localism (cups of tea and cobbled streets). But a question kept coming back to me: what exactly is Manchester – where does it begin and end? Strictly speaking, the city of Manchester is only a small part of a wider metropolitan region: the county of Greater Manchester, created in 1974, which brought together 10 metropolitan boroughs and two cities – Salford and Manchester – under a larger urban identity. Yet for me that wider urban region – which at 493 square miles is nearly as big as Greater London – meant very little, because I’d not had cause to visit many areas outside of the city centre.One year, 80 walks, 300 miles and 9,000 photographs later, I am still overwhelmed by the sheer variety of places, buildings and people. Everywhere was different and yet so much recurred. There was a whole family of buildings, both fanciful and mundane, that developed out of the co-operative movement, which began in Rochdale in the 1840s and quickly spread to the whole urban region and far beyond. There were the dozen or so libraries scattered around the region that were funded by Andrew Carnegie in the early 20th century (and most of which, thankfully, were still open – proof of a longstanding communal loyalty to these buildings). And there were the cotton mills: towering brick edifices in various states of disrepair that grew out of Manchester’s role in the industrial revolution as the global centre of cotton production. While many of these mills have now been demolished, hundreds still remain standing as testament to the industry that once united this enormous urban region and gave it a distinct working-class identity.For me though, it was the more mundane things that brought a sense of unity to Greater Manchester: the electricity substations, often built in a housing style, that told you which borough you were in the hundreds of Victorian terraces that still make up the majority of the region’s housing stock, which manage to be both uniform and endlessly varied in their small details and a gamut of ghost signs that identified lost industries from Manchester’s days as Cottonopolis. And then there were the bees – symbols of civic pride invented by the Victorians that were transformed in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing into icons of defiance, unity and strength. Countless bee stickers now adorn cars and windows, bee tattoos mark bodies, and bee paintings and murals enliven walls.Chance encounters along the way backed up the commonly held idea that people in the north of England are friendlier on many of my walks, people were keen to point out local landmarks and interesting buildings they’d grown up with. People were generally quick to identify themselves with the larger urban region, explicitly or otherwise. A farmer in Tyldesley spoke of the enormous pipes under his land that brought fresh water from Thirlmere in Cumbria to Manchester a pensioner in Bramhall told me how lucky he felt to be living in Stockport – half a mile away, outside Greater Manchester, he wouldn’t be entitled to free travel on public transport.It is these networks – the hidden infrastructures and invisible boundaries – that are perhaps the most important things that bring unity to a sprawling area. And yet there are still great disparities in Greater Manchester: for instance the woeful Northern Rail network that, for many is the only form of transport available apart from buses.I had not expected to come across architectural wonders outside the centre. So I am aghast that very few guides to Manchester include any detail on buildings such as Rochdale Town Hall, completed in 1871 and to my mind one of the finest Victorian buildings in the country. They also make little mention of the Monastery in Gorton, a monumental edifice completed in 1872 and reopened as a community hub in 2007. It is a gothic rampart that towers over one of the poorest districts of the city. And nowhere did I find reference to the joyous exuberance of many of the region’s mosques, or the astonishing 1930s stained glass that fills the church of St Oswald \u0026amp St Edmund Arrowsmith in Ashton-in-Makerfield.Of course, no single resource can offer an exhaustive visual record of the built environment and there are many types of building that I’ve not covered. My project, The Stones of Manchester, is more of an invitation to see the city anew to connect erse and fragmentary views to embrace the commonplace, often ignored things that make the area feel as though it belongs to us. In cities, it is what continues to endure, be it houses, amenities or infrastructure, that provides an anchor around which communities can flourish. In other words, precisely the opposite of what is currently happening in the heartland of Manchester, where buildings for the rich are disregarding not only the history of the city but also the people that made it.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7632b02e40c5fbe0842864087bf88e474c18b70e/458_0_3332_2000/master/3332.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589465a1caf5269c6d5191e7a6484a98","title":"suits fruit and scooters 30 years of hanois 36 streets in pictures","story":"William E Crawford was one of the first western photographers to work in postwar north Vietnam.

The firm itself is also expecting a hefty fine.So let’s talk about PwC, and three other firms – Ernst \u0026amp Young (EY), Deloitte and KPMG – who together make up the big four accountancy firms, in charge of auditing many of the world’s corporations and banks.These four firms are interesting because, despite signing off on the accounts for multibillion-pound banks just months before the 2008 financial crisis, they’ve largely escaped public anger. One of Fred Goodwin’s first acts when he became CEO of RBS was to bring in Deloitte, a firm he had previously worked for. In 2007, shortly before the taxpayer was forced to bail the bank out of its own reckless decision-making, Deloitte failed to raise any kind of warning about its finances. Despite this, Deloitte received a payrise in 2008 from RBS, and its senior partner John Connolly collected a £5.2m pay package the next year.Following the public bailout, an investigation into RBS was conducted by the Financial Services Authority, with the assistance of PwC. (It concluded that RBS had made a series of bad decisions in the years leading up to the financial crisis, but that they were not the result of a lack of integrity by any inidual at the bank and did not warrant enforcement action.)RBS replaced Deloitte with EY in 2014 – EY itself having been sued by New York prosecutors in 2010 over allegations it covered up the Lehman Brothers collapse. The firm settled the lawsuit for $10m in 2015, having agreed to pay $99m in damages to investors in a class-action settlement in 2013.Not only does the public have the right to ask just what is going on with this apparent human centipede of accountancy firms, but it’s high time we talked about nationalising them. Until 2010, we actually did have a public accountancy body called the Audit Commission, which audited £200bn spent by 11,000 public bodies. But in its infinite wisdom, the coalition government scrapped it because – according to Eric Pickles – accountancy should be done in a “competitive environment”.The Audit Commission was by no means perfect, but it was not embroiled in the number of financial scandals that the big four accountancy firms have been. Questions need to be asked about why these companies have repeatedly been found not to be doing their jobs properly whether the motive to make money has anything to do with that, and whether a publicly owned body that audits banks and big corporations may be necessary. The collapse of BHS resulted in 11,000 job losses: the negligence of these firms has real impacts on people’s livelihoods and families. Perhaps it’s time to bring them under public control."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9934427fc7197b939bc51c3855033dcd076a7e9f/0_171_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96f79fd74cfd7ce1a3af9b5088b4bf2e","title":"climate change baobab africa tree of life","story":"The trees are a scientific wonder, once capable of living for thousands of years, but now becoming endangered species• Giant African baobab trees die suddenly after thousands of yearsMorondava in Madagascar, the skyline in Senegal and Kruger national park all have something in common. These places are home to some of the largest trees in the world – baobabs, known to live for thousands of years. These amazing trees have trunks that can reach 30m in circumference or more. In Togo, there is a proverb: “Wisdom is like a baobab tree: no one inidual can embrace it.” In many African cultures, the tree is sacred.There are nine species of baobab in the world, and Madagascar, one of the world’s bioersity hotspots, is home to six. The African mainland and the Arabian peninsula have two, and Australia has one. Africa’s most notable species is the Adansonia digitata, named after the French botanist Michel Adanson, who undertook an 18th-century exploration of Senegal. He stayed there for five years and contributed to the publication of 1757’s Natural History of Senegal.Some of the most impressive trees from back then are still around, those from Madagascar especially: for example, the Adansonia grandidieri, or giant baobab, which can reach a height of 30m. It remains the most famous species of baobab in Madagascar. The rarest baobab species in Madagascar are the Adansonia perrieri and A. suarezensis.All three of these species are threatened and are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and recent assessments have suggested that the latter two species be reclassified as critically endangered. A. perrieri’s habitat is being lost to agriculture and development, whereas A. suarezensis’s biggest threats to survival are lightning, water logging, black fungus and drought. To make matters worse, the large animal species responsible for carrying seeds may have become extinct and hence reduced the wider distribution of the plant species.Africa’s “tree of life” may not have much longer left. It forms an integral part in people’s livelihoods. In west Africa, it is also called the “palaver tree” because of its social functions: when there is a problem in the community, meeting under the baobab tree with the chief or the tribesmen would be synonymous with trying to find a solution to that problem it reinforces trust and respect among members of the community. Its extinction would not simply be an environmental tragedy.The tree grows in very harsh conditions but is completely adapted to its environment: it sheds its leaves during the dry seasons to reduce water loss it has a tap root system long enough to reach moisture or even water and the thick bark protects it from bush fires. From a scientific point of view, the baobab tree is truly a complete plant. The leaves are used in traditional medicine to cure infectious diseases, while the fruit is high in nutrients and is used to make health foods. The seeds yield oil that is prized by the cosmetic industry. The trunk stores water and can be harvested by thirsty travellers.Yet these highly important species are threatened with extinction, due to climate change and human development. Some species may not survive the next century. While plants have generally adapted to extended droughts, climate change is different, and with the Anthropocene we are already witnessing the loss of these impressive trees.The greatest irony is that the African continent has hardly produced any greenhouse gases and yet is already bearing the brunt of the vagaries of climate change.

They’d appear in the guise of some charming man, about 60 years old. I would be seated beside him. It would all begin politely, but at some point someone at the table would mention #MeToo. Then something peculiar would happen. My dinner partner’s body language would change, and he’d launch into a heated diatribe against the movement. As if he’d blown an inner fuse.The first time, I was unsettled the second, shocked. The pattern was basically the same each time. A well-educated man, in some cases powerful, and then me, a female Danish author who is an amiable and willing conversationalist – and then #MeToo pops up. Upon which his perception of me shifts, and I become a dustbin for his rage.One of these dinner companions introduced his anger by saying: “Women always play the victim, but the true victims are men.” It was a clever opening gambit because he dominated the rest of the conversation, and since “women always play the victim”, I couldn’t argue that I couldn’t handle it. While I stared at his impeccably ironed shirt, he proceeded to explain – just as another man did at a dinner a month later – that “nobody was ever hurt by a slap on the bloody arse”.A third table companion took the time to explain to me men’s need to discharge semen, and women’s obligation to understand this need. It was getting on for Christmas. We managed to eat a duck while he held forth. This urge to discharge was so potent, he said, that women could rob men of their power “just with their bodies”. If they flaunted their wares, they were asking for it. They should cover up.Who are these men I keep meeting? Not patriarchs from the Middle Eastern cultures that are so often castigated, but native sons of the homeland of tolerance: Denmark.If you wish to understand the Danes, you need to understand the country’s phenomenon of frisind (a free mind). Frisind is rooted in the 19th-century “free spirit” movement that ultimately led to women’s suffrage in 1915 and then same-sex partnerships in 1989. It may sound paradoxical, but it’s precisely this phenomenon that made #MeToo take longer to get started in Denmark than in other European countries (most notably our neighbour Sweden, where the movement was swiftly embraced).Women across Europe are waging new battles, with one beautifully won in Ireland recently. #MeToo is likewise something we relate to beyond our national and cultural differences. In Denmark, however, it signalled its presence in the media most forcefully through the angry counter-reactions of these mature, powerful men.Why is that? If you look up frisind in the dictionary, it\u0026nbspmeans “an unprejudiced, tolerant attitude and way of thinking”. We Danes are just as proud of our tolerance as we are of hygge (“cosiness”, a phenomenon at the core of the Danish soul and which describes our feel-good attitude towards life), gender equality, freedom of speech and our democratic philosophy. That’s why frisind was given prominence in the Denmark Canon, a\u0026nbsplist of the 10 values that define us, published in 2016.The idea of tolerance has its roots deep in Danish history, notably with Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig, a 19th-century pastor and poet who maintained that you should be open to others’ points of view, even if you disagree with them, and who helped establish pluralism as a Danish value. In the 1920s and 30s, the Danish concept of tolerance began to include sexuality. With proponents such as the author Agnes Henningsen and her son, the writer and architect Poul Henningsen, frisind became a break with the old morality.The idea was that we should be natural in our sexuality. That women, like men, have a right to enjoy physical pleasure without subjecting themselves to the old norms. In 1969 this expansion of the concept of open-mindedness led to Denmark becoming the first country in the world to make pornography freely available. It was a revolt against the puritanical 1950s.In 1970, the year I was born, sex education was introduced by law in all Danish primary schools. Thus I learned in class to understand sexual frisind like this: that everyone is free to make their own decisions concerning their bodies that I have the right to my own desire, and the right to enter into sexual relations with consenting partners and that no one can judge me for the natural urges of my body. The healthy message of frisind was: as long as you don’t violate others, you are free.The men that I and many other women keep encountering in the wake of #MeToo, the ones who insist that a slap on the backside never hurt anyone, took part in the sexual liberation of the 1960s and 70s. They enjoyed it like the smorgasbord, a Scandinavian buffet you can pick and choose from. Now they think #MeToo is out to destroy frisind. If you don’t agree, you’re a puritanical prude of the kind we Danes have a tradition of rebelling against. In some ways, #MeToo in Denmark has ended up being about how we define one of the best things we have: sexual tolerance.The meaning of concepts can shift over time without us noticing. Two of us can sit at a dinner table and not know how the other person reads a phenomenon that is so deeply rooted in our common culture. In my version, frisind is a gift that gives me the right to be a sexual being. I can say either yes or no to sexual relations. I\u0026nbspchoose not to slap other people on their bums unless they really want me to.But in the version of those older frisind men, this Danish open-mindedness and tolerance is a privilege. A right. Their right. Frisind gives them, over the roast duck and clinking silverware, the right to threaten me with a good old slap on the arse, a slap I’m not allowed to deny them.I don’t know if any of them noticed how quiet I\u0026nbspbecame when they spoke like this. If they did, did they ask themselves why? Probably not. But here’s the answer: the first time I was unsettled, the second time I\u0026nbspwas shocked. The third time, I took notes.• Dorthe Nors is a Danish writer and novelist.

Is it because of helmet hair? Or the bottom-amplifying effects of Lycra? There’s no doubt that women generally feel more pressure to look presentable than men. And although I’m rarely troubled by saddle sores, I find the logistics of cycling to work a right pain in the bum: the skanky showers, the outfit changes, the struggle to find somewhere discreet to plug in a hairdryer. And yes, I know that everyone in the Netherlands rides in their ordinary clothes, but I live in Stockport and work in Manchester: would you like to sit next to me unwashed after I’ve ridden 10 miles?The main reason most women don’t cycle in the UK is because they think it is dangerous. You can tell them until the cows come home that the roads are statistically safe, and that you are more likely to be killed walking than on a bicycle. But when they sit on the top deck of a bus and look down to see a cyclist squashed up against the kerb they feel no compulsion whatsoever to join them. Women do seem to be more vulnerable, perhaps because they are often more reluctant to “own” the lane and so end up in the gutter: 10\u0026nbspout of 13 cyclists killed in London in 2009 were women, and eight of them were killed by left-turning HGVs, according to the campaign group Cycling UK.Xavier Brice, at Sustrans, believes city planners are to blame. “Fifty-one per cent of the UK population is female, yet most of our cities are failing to design roads and streets for women to cycle,” he says. It cannot help that women remain under-represented among the transport planners and engineers who design our streets. And most council leaders, who decide how to spend the transport budget, are men.Take Manchester, which has been ruled for more than 20 years by Richard Leese, the council leader. He cycles but was always lukewarm on segregated cycle lanes, say local campaigners. His view, they say, was that smoother tarmac was the answer: if only they could find the cash to fill in all the potholes then more people would saddle up. When new infrastructure was proposed he was against it if it threatened traffic flows.Recently Leese has changed his tune: a nasty scare after getting his wheel stuck in the tram tracks may or may not have sped up his conversion. He now has an Olympic champion on his case too, after Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester’s mayor, appointed Chris Boardman to be its first cycling and walking commissioner. In his first interview after getting the job last year Boardman told me even he no longer felt safe riding on UK streets. Now we have a developing network of segregated lanes in Greater Manchester, with Boardman due to announce more by the end of the month. I\u0026nbspregularly ride along one of them, which goes through the university and hospital districts, and am often struck by how many women I see. On Tuesday I took a Mobike to interview students at Manchester Met and was pleased to see a nurse fly by in her blue uniform, perhaps late for a shift at the infirmary.Until very recently I took a slightly quicker route home, bombing along main roads. Then I got knocked off by someone who didn’t bother looking before he opened his door. I was unhurt, and will not appear in the cycling safety statistics. But when women tell me cycling is too dangerous I can’t, in good conscience, persuade them otherwise.• Helen Pidd is the ’s North of England editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82592fe9a6f09bb07c6b37f01d0e83677de12998/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465b372698893343097ba222137aed78","title":"can cricket become the game of choice for young bme women","story":"Cricket has a huge following among the BME community – particularly south Asians – yet few women try their hand at the sport. Two Leicestershire women have set out to change thatGrowing up in Pakistan, Nafeesa Katib remembers watching cricket with her siblings on a TV hired at the weekend as a treat. It wasn’t a viewing choice at the time – it was the only thing being broadcast – but she remembers it fondly. “Even if we didn’t like cricket we had to watch it, and in the end all of us fell in love with the game,” she says. She remembers thinking: “Where are all the women on the cricket field?” That thought stuck with her after she moved to the UK as a teenager. Now 41, and living in Leicestershire with her husband and two children of her own, she is helping to redress that imbalance, in her role as a cricket coach for girls aged eight to 14. Her hope is to be a role model to all the girls who attend her sessions – but also to show, as a visibly Muslim woman playing and teaching cricket, that a headscarf need not stop anyone playing sport. “If you’ve got somebody who inspires you, who shows you, yes, I can do it, it’s a great feeling. And that’s what I try do,” says Katib.Women’s cricket has never been more popular in the UK – 2017 was a landmark year, as millions watched the England team triumph in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in front of a sold-out crowd at Lord’s. In the wake of that result, the cricket governing board said it was committed to getting more south Asian women involved in the game.One reason is the lack of appropriate coaching and facilities. In Oadby, where Katib lives, there were no organised sporting activities for her nine-year-old daughter on a Saturday morning – until cricket came along. “Most of the things are aimed at boys, like the football clubs for example,” says Katib. “There were some crafty things for girls, but not all girls are into arts and crafts.”Her friend and fellow coach Mai Kazi emphasises that the scheduling of sports sessions can be an issue, particularly for kids who come from a Muslim background. “Most of the Muslim kids in the area go to Islamic school between 4pm and 6pm, and that’s when most of the clubs are held,” says Kazi. But a Saturday morning works perfectly for her and her 13-year-old daughter, and the sessions are something they now do together. The coaches have worked hard to create a safe environment for girls from all backgrounds, who might be feeling apprehensive about throwing themselves into the game.“There are a few girls who wear headscarves,” says Katib. “The first time they came they were very nervous and really worried about them, with one hand touching their head at all times. But over time I’ve been able to give them a bit of confidence. At the end of the day, it’s all girls there.”Although having women run the sessions has boosted participation from the local Muslim and south Asian community, it’s the sight of two familiar faces that encourages parents to keep bringing their kids back. “A lot of the mums that drop their girls off know us from school,” says Kazi. “We live in a very small borough, so it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. There is obviously the sense of: ‘Oh, this is run by someone we know.’”She believes that community feeling is essential to the project’s success: “The fact it’s very local has really appealed to people – otherwise, they’d have to travel to Leicester, which isn’t always possible.”Katib has just completed her level two coaching certificate and hopes, one day, to run her own club. But the key thing for her is to keep showing her daughter there’s no such thing as a sport girls can’t do.“I’ve never wanted my daughter to think that certain things are only for girls, and that certain things are only for boys,” she says. “There shouldn’t be any limitations for anything.” In 2017 one of the key elements of Natwest’s partnership with the ECB was to help raise funding to open up even more opportunities for young people, both male and female, to enjoy cricket. This will continue in 2018.As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

Entrepreneurial experts share their hard-learned lessons, from the genuinely useful to what to avoidDon’t get lost in the crowdYou may think your product is better than everything else, but without something distinctive about it, it’s not going to stand out. “When I do consultancy work occasionally and, say, someone’s made a new T-shirt, I’ll say: ‘What’s so good about it?’” says Kuldip Singh Sahota, founder and chief executive of Mr Singh’s chilli sauces and crisps. “They’ll say, the fabric or design, but that’s what everyone says. What’s going to make you stand out? That’s where your brand and authenticity comes in, especially in such a crowded market.”Dave Bailey, a business coach and entrepreneur, agrees: “When you’re starting a new business, you have to get people to believe what you believe. And they’re never going to believe someone they think is fake or doing it for the wrong reasons.”Do have a good storyIt’s the entrepreneur who can spin a good yarn who gains a head start. For Sahota, that was the chilli sauce recipe his father Hardev “Pops” Singh Sahota had perfected over decades in the family’s shed in east London. They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

The email also said the waste of food involved added to the stress of people sleeping rough in the city, whose number has doubled in the last year.It also implied, however, that the goodwill of students was a contributory factor in the increase. “Oxford’s students have a highly developed social conscience, as is evident from the number of homeless people who come to seek assistance in this city. Needless waste of food is an aggravation of their distress,” it said.“This is unlikely to have a positive effect on applications from underprivileged minorities,” it said.Students flagged up the email on social media to express their incredulity at the suggestion that homeless people were drawn to the city because of the generosity of students.Defending the email in Cherwell, the Oxford student newspaper, Edwards said: “The fact that homeless people come to Oxford from elsewhere is clearly acknowledged. This is a credit to the city’s excellent facilities, but also, we believe, to the generosity of students, townsfolk and tourists.”The university played down the comments, insisting the email was primarily aimed at curbing trashing. A statement said: “The overall intention of the proctors was to appeal to the social and environmental consciences of Oxford students, urging them to consider the impact of the waste and inconvenience caused by trashing.”Jane Cranston, a former high sheriff of Oxfordshire who now chairs an inquiry into rough sleeping in the city, said the proctors were right to highlight the well-developed social conscience of students, but added: “To suggest that homeless people are attracted to Oxford because of it is a more questionable statement. Oxford has a reputation as a ‘safe’ city for homeless people and many people, including the city council, the county council, many charities, the churches, students and members of the public contribute a great deal of time, care and professionalism to tackling this distressing social problem.”Alex Kumar, the chair of Oxford student union’s homelessness campaign, accused the university of trying to “cynically weaponise Oxford’s homelessness crisis as an attack on students”.He added: “One cannot view the escalating homelessness crisis in this country as detached from the housing crisis – a crisis exaggerated, even driven, by speculation on the housing market and the ownership of property throughout this country increasingly in the hands of few, as demonstrated by recent revelations about the grand scope of property held by the university across this entire country.” Linda Smith, the deputy leader of Oxford city council, said the rise in rough sleeping in the city was driven by government cuts to mental health and substance addiction services. “It is a national problem. We didn’t have this problem on our streets of Oxford 10 years ago,” she said. “Belatedly the government has woken up to this and Oxford was awarded £500,000 last week. “We already fund 167 beds and we will be expanding our provision to fund an extra 64 beds next winter. We want to get to a position where nobody has to sleep rough on the streets of Oxford.”Asked whether rough sleeping was linked to the generosity of students, Smith said: “Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I’m not going to suggest that people should not give to beggars.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2ae2c7f408a1ececdb9c29b6f0ae0c36f8c9f3/21_71_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30ea9b22aade5fb813b0988404db0176","title":"england 2018 world cup team photo the fashion verdict","story":"From Harry Kane’s hair to John Stones’ coy pose, we rate the Three Lions’ lineup for their Marks \u0026amp Spencer photoshootIt is always curious to see a footballer in a suit, rather than his or her kit.

That the British retailer is in financial trouble, with 100 stores to close in the next four years, is well-documented, as are claims that it has forgotten who its target customer is. But judging by its autumnwinter 2018 womenswear presentation in London on Tuesday, the potential is there: next season is all about quality, consistency and rediscovering its core customer.“This is heartland M\u0026ampS,” said the company’s style director, Belinda Earl, introducing the new foundation edit she described as “the mainstays of any woman’s working wardrobe”. It includes a city coat, a black blazer, a pair of black trousers and a striped Breton top. The focus at M\u0026ampS this season is to provide beautifully executed staples that women can wear day to night, throughout the year, every year things that, says Earl, “we’re known for and want to be known for even more to build a broader customer base”.There remain seasonal trend items with which to mix and match, such as statement T-shirts, metallic pleated skirts and – something the design team are predicting will be a hit – a buckled kilt that comes in traditional tartan as well as black. There are also several contenders for the “new pink coat”, including a long Prince of Wales check coat, £99 a long shearling-style coat, £99 and (the style that everyone will want) a faux-fur leopard-print teddy-bear coat, £79.However, the emphasis on understanding what M\u0026ampS has historically been really good at – knitwear, outerwear and underwear – is clear and will be what they are hoping bring back to the masses. Trousers come in multiple cuts and colourways, as does knitwear, while tailoring is available in classic heritage patterns and materials. At the presentation, the design team showcased its clothes alongside underwear to show it has approached this collection with a more holistic idea of how women dress – ie choosing what bra and knickers to wear depending on what we want to put on top. Crucially, though, these mainstays won’t be one-season wonders, but will reappear next season and the one after that.“It’s something that we’re very conscious of doing,” said Earl. “When you do find a piece, you tend to want more and we’re looking to build on that.

Her last UK stage appearance was at the Barbican in London in 2012 in Botho Strauss’s Big and Small.Crimp’s play is called When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other – Twelve Variations on Samuel Richardson’s Pamela. Richardson’s Pamela, a kind of 18th-century Fifty Shades of Grey, is an epistolary novel about a young maid terrorised and imprisoned by a libertine nobleman. It caused a sensation after it was published in 1740 with its theme of love and marriage across the social ide.The National Theatre said Crimp was using Pamela as a provocation with five characters acting out “a dangerous game of sexual domination and resistance”.It said the play would break through “the surface of contemporary debate to explore the messy, often violent nature of desire, and the fluid, complicated roles that men and women play”.Blanchett’s co-star Dillane, who played Stannis Baratheon in Game of Thrones and Viscount Halifax in The Darkest Hour, is returning to the National for the first time since The Coast of Utopia in 2002 and reuniting with Mitchell after productions which include Endgame, Uncle Vanya, The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd and Four Quartets.Mitchell, regarded by some as a theatre visionary and one of Britain’s finest living stage directors, has not directed at the National since the brutally shocking production of Cleansed in 2016.She said: “It’s great to be working with Martin again on this powerful new text and to continue my special collaboration with Stephen Dillane. At the same time I’m delighted to welcome Cate Blanchett to the National, and look forward to developing a new working relationship with this extraordinary actor.”Blanchett had been rumoured to be starring in a forthcoming West End production of All About Eve, directed by Ivo van Hove, but reportedly withdrew because of a scheduling conflict.The National Theatre said more information on the Crimp play, which opens in January 2019, would be announced in the autumn when tickets go on sale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f81b0abc1452015f4b7a557737c8412c2c187c/0_196_5995_3597/master/5995.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c67e7e8f457960984ed146641353c6f","title":"oceans 8 review sandra bullock cate blanchett anne hathaway","story":"This Ocean’s Eleven spin-off in which an all-female gang plots a daring daylight robbery soon runs out of steamYou’ve heard of The Sons of Katie Elder.

Except that it’s more a gender-switch on Ocean’s Twelve or Ocean’s Thirteen, those bleary sequels that stumbled their way to the DVD bin of yesterdecade. Maybe getting a woman director would have given it more zip, though the problem is with the script.Sandra Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, sister of Danny, just out on parole. She cheekily contacts her old compadre Lou (a seriously underused Cate Blanchett) to set up the daring robbery she’s been perfecting in her head during five long years in the joint. Debbie has to assemble a crew for this job: to steal a multi-million-dollar diamond necklace from the exquisitely contoured, swan-like neck of superstar Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) as she attends Manhattan’s ultra-elite Met gala. For this they need crooked designer Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter) fence Tammy (Sarah Paulson) bling-thief specialist Amita (Mindy Kaling) pickpocket Constance (Awkwafina) and hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna). Ocean’s 8 motors along pretty enjoyably for a while it’s always great to hear Bullock break out her raspingly fluent German, and there are some flavoursome cameos, including Anna Wintour and a subliminal walk-on for Wendi Deng. But Debbie’s smaller-scale mischief – shoplifting and scamming free nights in luxury hotels – is weirdly more enjoyable than the main event. Then the mark introduces a lame third-act twist, more of a stagger, the tension goes slack and it all heads south. Where were the climactic crises and heroic solutions? Where were the big moments where it all goes wrong and then right in unexpected ways? Where were the flashbacks disclosing that we, the audience, have been played? Where, in fact, was the dramatic interest? Nowhere. It just blandly settles on a note of sentimental self-congratulation and unruffled triumph.

Most of its 22,000 residents work in the mining industry, his first coach lost his hand in a mining accident and the only full-size football pitch is in a terrible condition even in the summer, not to mention the freezing winters.Slightly built and a bit shy but determined and dedicated in the extreme, the midfielder was spotted by CSKA Moscow scouts at the age of 16. Nurtured carefully by the coach Leonid Slutsky, he was promoted to CSKA’s first-team squad in 2015, made exceptional progress and played for the national team at Euro 2016, albeit slightly out of position. By the time of the Confederations Cup in 2017, Golovin was absolutely integral to the side, frequently linked with a move to clubs such as Arsenal and Chelsea. In 2018 he is seen as Russia’s main source of creativity – at the age of 22.If only Russia could tell a few more stories like Golovin’s, they would have been a major force when staging the World Cup on home soil. In a vast country of nearly 145 million people, where football is the most popular sport despite fierce competition from ice hockey, there must be many similar talents waiting to be unearthed. But their chances of catching anyone’s attention are close to zero, while those who do miraculously make it into professional football do not receive the right help to develop.The core of the problem is not financial. A lot of money has been poured into Russian football in recent times, especially since the country was awarded this World Cup in 2010, but it was not spent wisely. Instead of investing in academies, youth coaching and quality training pitches, including indoor facilities, it was wasted on expensive foreigners, agents’ fees and disproportionate salaries. As a result, few Russian players regularly performed at a decent level, while those who did largely lost all motivation to improve because they were spoiled.It is quite curious to compare the current situation to that of the early 1990s, after the Soviet Union broke up. At the time Russian football was in a disastrous state economically and players dreamed of moving to western Europe. The most talented found themselves in the top leagues, such as Igor Shalimov and Igor Kolyvanov in Serie A, Andrei Kanchelskis in the Premier League, Valery Karpin, Aleksandr Mostovoi and Viktor Onopko in La Liga, and Sergei Kiryakov in the Bundesliga. Others went to earn their living in lesser leagues such as Israel. Their places in the Russian league were taken by up-and-coming youngsters and, while the level of football was not that great, they enjoyed a lot of opportunities to develop.Thus the generation of the 2000s grew up witnessing the international success of Russian players and wanted to follow in their footsteps. That is why players including Andrey Arshavin, Aleksandr Kerzhakov, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Pavel Pogrebnyak were desperate to prove their worth outside of Russia. In their era salaries at Zenit St Petersburg and Spartak Moscow were already quite high but that did not stop them. In fact they were ready to earn less in order to play at a better level. Times change, though, and the current generation is different.With names such as Samuel Eto’o, Hulk and Axel Witsel lured to the Russian Premier League at the beginning of the decade, the salaries of homegrown players increased dramatically as well. In order to prevent clubs from fielding only foreigners, the Russian FA imposed a quota on non-Russian players allowed for each game. Consequently the price of the most talented Russians went up even further, the best example being the promising yet unproven striker Aleksandr Kokorin who earned €5m a year at Dynamo Moscow.No club outside of Russia would have paid Kokorin even a third of that, thus there was no chance of him moving abroad. He did not feel the need to improve in the Russian league either, and seemed to concentrate on finding ways to waste his wealth. When reports of Kokorin and his team-mate Pavel Mamaev spending €250,000 on champagne in Monte Carlo after the national team were eliminated from Euro 2016 reached the home, fans easily believed them, even though the duo claimed the numbers were exaggerated.Kokorin and Mamaev are not alone. Alan Dzagoev was considered one of the brightest teenage talents in the world a decade ago but the midfielder chose to stay at CSKA and his development had gradually stalled. Oleg Shatov, also born in 1990, showed remarkable potential in his youth but lost his way completely and was not considered for the World Cup squad. Both were 20 when Russia was awarded the tournament. Ideally they should be world-class stars by now, hoping to lead the national team to glory but, while they are far from blameless themselves, the system contributed to their downfall.A lack of planning is evident in every department of the national team. Take central defence. Everyone knew that Sergei Ignashevich would celebrate his 39th birthday during the World Cup, and the Berezutsky twins would turn 36. Nevertheless, even the limit on foreign players did not help. Apart from CSKA, all the top clubs still used foreign centre-backs and Russia were left without decent successors when the trio of veterans retired from the international game in 2016.Stanislav Cherchesov, the Russia coach, was forced to use the inexperienced Georgi Dzhikiya, the unconvincing converted left-back Fyodor Kudryashov and the error-prone Viktor Vasin, who waited for his chance on the CSKA bench until the age of 28 – but even that emergency plan was ruined when Vasin and Dzhikiya tore knee ligaments earlier this year. Ignashevich has came out of retirement for the World Cup but the fact he is by far the best solution speaks volumes about Russia’s disastrous preparations.The irony is there must be thousands of potentially top-class, physically strong centre-backs in Siberian towns such as Kaltan. The Russian game is just unable to find them, teach them, give them opportunities at the required level and send them out to get some experience in the top leagues. Thus those would-be footballers work in the mines instead, while Iceland – with a population of nearly 340,000 – is expected to have a much better World Cup.The reason is obvious. Iceland were minnows until starting a magnificent long-term project at the beginning of the century, based on training youngsters, promoting youth coaches and building facilities that allow year-round playing. Russia invested their money in buying Hulk and building a white elephant of a stadium in Saransk instead. They are, quite simply, the exact opposite of Iceland, and that is their tragedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d8461c488f8aab9c8a61001dc7ce2fb70fc4890/0_298_4534_2720/master/4534.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4acb6ed7b65242546ee8e3ba4a729f3","title":"why americans should support mexico at the world cup","story":"Can I see hardcore American Outlaws wearing Mexico shirts this summer? Maybe not just yet but El Tri have plenty to offer fans in the USAs an athlete of Mexican descent who won gold for the United States at the Olympics, I know there is a little friction, to say the least, between the US and Mexico.So I understand that for some it’s hard to embrace the idea that Americans will cheer for their biggest rivals, Mexico, at the World Cup – particularly after the US missed out on this month’s tournament in Russia. But I can see it happening. Let me explain.The US failure to qualify for the World Cup shocked me because domestic soccer in this country is only growing and getting better, just as it is in Liga MX. Indeed, we’re already starting to see that American fans have begun to embrace the Mexican league. I watched a Mexican domestic game a few weeks back and when the camera panned to the crowd, I saw tons of Americans wearing US colors. And that’s because of the appreciation that supporters here in the United States now have for the game. Fifteen years ago, we didn’t have many soccer fans in America. We didn’t know what the beautiful game was until recently.But now USA fans now look at soccer on a global scale. They’re not just stuck on supporting the USMNT, they’re taking note of every team, including the Mexicans. They are opening up their eyes and realizing: “Wow, the Mexican team are really good. Why don’t we try and support them?” US fans appreciate passionate, skilled teams – and they like how El Tri play.And then there’s the huge part Mexican-American and Latino fans play within US soccer. Look at Major League Soccer’s newest club, LAFC. Half of the fans there are of Mexican descent. So the support that MLS has here in the US has a huge part to do with Mexico fans.Can I see hardcore American Outlaws wearing Mexico shirts this summer? Maybe not just yet, but as long as Mexico play to their undoubted ability anything is possible. Americans love a winner. Imagine the reaction here if El Tri won the World Cup and fans from both sides of the border cheered. So it’s a matter of the respect of the sport and the appreciation that the players are getting better and they’re growing.If American fans see a great player, if we see a great team, if we see somebody winning a World Cup, we’re going to support them. Even if it is Mexico!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cdf88fac9ade3cb4cf796cf1d1f94af2ec2c01b/0_191_4243_2546/master/4243.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f8935886ef28588d3144968f764030a","title":"world cup 2026 vote north america morocco","story":"The 2026 World Cup will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico after they beat Morocco by a margin of 69 votes to host the tournament which will be expanded to 48 teams for the first time.The Moroccan bid used its final address to Fifa congress to point out the country has a ban on weapons and would not hike up ticket prices to increase profit, a thinly veiled swipe at its rivals. But it was not enough to sway the room as it lost the vote, with the United 2026 bid receiving 134 votes to its 65.The United States-led bid was judged by a Fifa taskforce to be vastly superior to its north African rivals on technical grounds, with a total of 23 stadiums, already built or under construction, at its disposal. Morocco, while enticing some federations with its commitment to fan engagement in a footballing nation, would have had to build or renovate all of the 14 stadiums in its bid book.That difference – alongside the promise of £4bn in extra profit for the federations – was enough to convince some undecided voters to side with the United 2026 campaign, which opened its final 15-minute pitch by handing the stage to Alphonso Davies, a 17-year-old Canadian born in a Liberian refugee camp in Ghana. “In Canada, they’ve welcomed me and I know they’ll welcome you,” he said.Of 211 federations, 203 submitted a vote. That number accounted for the four bidding nations who were ineligible, plus three American-governed territories who abstained because of a perceived conflict of interest plus Ghana, who did not attend congress after corruption allegations. The way the federations voted was made public for the first time, perhaps the most surprising revelation being Russia voting for the United 2026 bid despite political tensions between the nations.The Fifa heirarchy, including the president, Gianni Infantino, preferred the North American bid which has promised to generate around an $11bn (£8.24bn) profit for Fifa compared to the projected $5.7bn (£4.48bn) a Morocco World Cup would raise. The Moroccans had been keen to emphasise its more fan-friendly pricing in contrast with the United 2026 bid which stated an average ticket price of $431 (£322), a significant increase on the Brazil and Russia World Cups.It was the first World Cup vote since 2010, when the FA suffered humiliation after Russia won the right to host the 2018 tournament. Allegations of corruption immediately followed that vote with Qatar securing the 2022 event. The prospect of a more controversy-free World Cup also swayed Fifa in favour of the United 2026 bid.Infantino took the opportunity to claim the Fifa landscape has drastically changed since he succeeded Sepp Blatter. “It was clinically dead when I took over two years ago,” he said. “Now it is alive. There are no longer additional costs in the balance sheet.”Proceedings at congress, held at Moscow’s Expocentre on the outskirts of the city centre, came to an unexpected halt halfway through as Infantino announced the arrival of Vladimir Putin. Most of the hall rose to their feet to greet the arrival of the Russian president but the FA delegation, led by the chief executive, Martin Glenn, remained seated. Putin offered little alternative to David Gill, the English Fifa council member, but to shake his hand as he made his way along the line of those on the stage.Eight years ago when Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup in Zurich, Putin spoke mainly in English as he thanked the audience “from the bottom of my heart”. He struck a different, more serious tone this time round although he was full of praise for Infantino, calling him a “good front man and true fighter”. Infantino responded in kind, thanking Putin “on behalf of the entire world of football ... from the bottom of our heart a big thank you for your engagement, for your passion, for really making us feel part of the same team”.Putin closed his speech by saying in English: “Welcome to Russia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81cda90955a321fe9401aa6cc8e3daafea9aef0/762_306_3988_2393/master/3988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b693b8af61208e4828938875f34147","title":"godspeed england reigniting loving feeling 2018 world cup","story":"A World Cup is upon us, which means it’s time to look forward as well as back. Forward to a glut of football over the next few weeks – some of it great, some of it poor, all of it compelling – and back to previous tournaments, acting as they do as signposts in our lives. We remember how they shaped our summers as well as ourselves and, as is the case with most things, the first World Cup tends to mean the most.Italia ‘90. That was mine. I was nine, a year into my love affair with football and it was the tournament that sealed the deal. Omam-Biyik’s header against Argentina Baggio’s dribble against Czechoslovakia Schillaci’s eyes Rijkaard’s mouth O’Leary’s penalty the warm hue of the television coverage that was like nothing I had seen before ... it was mesmerising. And making that summer of 28 years ago even more glorious, there was England.Oh, England. Young readers may struggle to believe this but there was a time when the national team were less a trigger for regret and cynicism and more a source of pride and hope. More than that they were liked, and no more so than in 1990.Bobby Robson, everyone’s favourite uncle, was in charge and the team was made up of seemingly decent blokes, the type who smell of Old Spice and have normal, proper jobs. Add Paul Gascoigne, that most lovable of rascals, to the mix and it was easy to be intoxicated by “our boys”. World in Motion played endlessly during those long, warm days and it went on all the way to the semi-finals, at which point there were tears before bedtime but also confirmation that, yes, I was an England fan.But it didn’t last. Come France ‘98 I was utterly indifferent to England’s progress and by Euro 2000 the bond had snapped completely. I laughed when Phil Neville gave away that penalty against Romania, a reaction that confirmed the worst – not only did I no longer care about England, I found their failings utterly hilarious.Several factors explain the change. On a somewhat superficial level, I found it increasingly difficult to get behind players from Manchester United, Chelsea, Everton and elsewhere as my dedication to being a Liverpool supporter hardened during my teenage and early adult years. Wanting the likes of Gary Neville, John Terry and Wayne Rooney to do well felt like an act of treachery rather than loyalty, with all the overblown fuss that surrounded the “golden generation” hardly helping matters. By the mid-noughties England felt like a travelling band of celebrities and no good can, and should, come from that.On a deeper level there was also the fact that as I got older, I felt less English. It’s the fate of many second-generation immigrants and especially those who have seen their mum called a “fucking Paki”, as I did in the nineties. Quite frankly, there’s nothing like a bit of racist abuse hurled at one of your parents in the middle of the street to make a person feel disconnected from the place of their birth and those who live in it.The hooliganism was a problem too, and in that sense Euro 2000 was a real watershed moment. Seeing those boozed-up dunderheads tear through Charleroi before England’s game against Germany made it even clearer that this particular source of national engagement wasn’t for me.All of which was a shame given how much England had meant to me, with Euro ‘96 the undoubted high point. I’m from Wembley and it felt like the centre of the universe for those few weeks in June. I also went to the Scotland game, saw Gascoigne score that goal and, up to that point, had never felt more deliriously content.The love died but now, slowly but surely, it has returned. Well, sort of. Because as England get comfortable in Russia I find myself willing them to do well. Godspeed Gareth and the boys, to Volgograd and beyond.This is an England setup that is easy to get behind. The manager is thoughtful and upstanding, bringing a primary school headteacher quality to the role (not to mention an actual tactical plan), while most of the players come across as decent lads. Yes there’s Jesse Lingard and his bloody dabs but even he fizzes with a tiggerish energy that is rather endearing.The captain, meanwhile, looks like the type of bloke you’d hire off Checkatrade to paint your spare room and be thoroughly satisfied with his time-keeping as well as work, while the sinister targeting of Raheem Sterling by a certain section of the media has had the effect of turning the player into a figure of sympathy.So England are nice again, unburdened by hype and Baden-Baden narcissism, and that’s no bad thing, especially as Brexit continues to tear a hole through society. Frankly, it’s become exhausting arguing with people over the colour of a passport and now comes a chance for the fighting to pause and for everyone to get behind a single cause.That’s certainly what I intend to do, and while too much has happened since 1990 for me to feel deep affection for England, there’s enough there to work with, enough for me to say I want ‘us’ to do well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949fff36c56a56f5cc69810deeb28c09782bab81/0_0_3982_3186/master/3982.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1d3dff4ead1afc24d3340909bed9670e 1440w","title":"world cup 2026 vote fifa nations choose between north america and morocco live","story":"In 2,920 days, give or take, the World Cup will kick off in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Donald Trump, who actively lobbied for the bid in his own inimitable way, has weighed in on the result. The US president could be midway through his third term when the tournament kicks off during America’s Sestercentennial.Oscar De La Hoya embodied the American dream when he went from a poor Mexican-American teenager to Olympic gold medalist ... and ultimately one of his generation’s richest and most decorated world champions as a professional. He’s written an essay for  US, in English and in Spanish, on why Americans should back Mexico at the World Cup. The dizzying high of today’s outcome for American soccer fans will soon be tempered by a harsh comedown. Namely, when the World Cup kicks off tomorrow in Russia, the United States men’s national team will be watching it from their living rooms for the first time in more than three decades after a disastrous qualifying campaign.That’s rendered many Americans emotional free agents for this year’s tournament, but here at  US we’ve decided to throw our support behind Mexico. In the next few weeks, we’ll have a reporter at each of Mexico’s games, starting from their opener against the reigning champions Germany on Sunday. We’ll also liveblog every El Tri game – in English and Spanish – and provide news and analysis throughout the tournament.All three heads of the winning federations are predictably thrilled with today’s result. Their immediate reactions:“Hosting the 2026 Fifa World Cup is a rare and important moment to demonstrate that we are all truly united through sport,” US Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro said in a release distributed immediately after the result was announced. “We are humbled by the trust our colleagues in the Fifa family have put in our bid strengthened by the unity between our three countries and the Concacaf region and excited by the opportunity we have to put football on a new and sustainable path for generations to come.”“We are grateful for the chance to bring to life Fifa’s new vision for the future of football,” said Decio de María, president of the Mexico Football Federation. “Together – in partnership with our candidate host cities, the Member Associations, and Fifa – we will use this platform to unite the world around football and help create a new and sustainable blueprint for the future of Fifa World Cups.”“Hosting a Fifa World Cup is an extraordinary honor and privilege,” said Steven Reed, president of Canada Soccer. “Canada, Mexico, and the United States are ready to welcome the world to North America and serve as stewards of the largest Fifa World Cup in history. Our vision is of a world of opportunity for our candidate host cities and for the global football community.”USA 94, the first and only time the World Cup was staged in the United States, started and ended with a missed penalty. But everything that happened in between offered a compelling proof of concept that ultimately Fifa’s member nations were unable to resist today in Moscow. The 1994 World Cup set an attendance record that still stands with nearly 3.6m spectators (for only 52 matches), which augurs a record-smashing profit of $11bn for the expanded 48-team, 80-match tournament in 2026. That was twice what Morocco could promise. Throw in the nod toward the fiscally responsible, infrastructure-ready leanings of the moment – the US is one of the few countries on the planet with enough world-class stadiums, airports, hotels and training facilities to host the World Cup tomorrow if it needed to – and it’s no surprise that Fifa’s member federations voted the way they did.Interestingly, Fifa awarded the United States its first World Cup on the Fourth of July in 1988. The countries that it beat out? Brazil and ... Morocco.The United Bid received 134 votes, Morocco received 65 votes while one country voted for neither.Here’s the final tally on the voting body. A total of 210 members are present and eligible to vote but seven will abstain: the four countries directly involved (USA, Canada, Mexico and Morocco) and three US-governed territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands).The members have been prompted to vote electronically and they will have 15 seconds to cast their ballots.Former Bolton Wanderers and Senegal midfielder Khalilou Fadiga is speaking now. He doesn’t exactly dodge the money issue in his impassioned remarks:Football is love and Africa loves football. I’m here to ask for your vote. Why? ... Because Africa is the birthplace of humanity. Africa has given everything to the world. Now it’s up to you to understand that football is not just a question of money and finances, but it is deeply rooted in passion and enthusiasm. In Africa, we don’t have a lot of material wealth, but we do have that joy and we do have that passion and we do want to welcome you on our continent because this is the competition that we have been working in order to host. Africa has given everything to you and I do believe it is time to pay back to Africa.The representatives for the United Bid have finished their presentation and now it’s Morocco’s turn to make their final pitch. It starts with a video presentation (with an American voice-over) keeping with the running theme of casting perceived weaknesses as strengths, promising a more compact experience relative to North America’s sprawling three-country plan. Notably, the narrator promises $5bn of profits for Fifa, which is less than half the $11bn guaranteed by the United Bid moments ago. Now a Moroccan government minister roams the stage with a hands-free microphone making the case in French.Meanwhile, it appears as if the Spanish drama will be a net positive for the North American bid.If these final presentations aren’t grabbing you, here’s some light reading material to tide you over. The official bid books for Morocco and USA-Mexico-Canada, which spell out the proposals in painstaking detail.Infantino is going through the voting procedure in exhaustive detail. Meanwhile, a series of flowcharts flash on the monitors behind him. No one can plead ignorance after this. Now each bid will make their final presentations. The United Bid, which won a drawing of lots, will go first. First to speak is Alphonso Davies, a 17-year-old winger with the Vancouver Whitecaps of Major League Soccer and the Canadian national team, saying he looks forward to playing in a World Cup on home soil. Mexican Football Federation president Decio De Maria speaks next, followed by Brianna Pinto, a member of the US women’s under-20 national team.Representatives for each bid will have a chance to make a final 15-minute presentation to the congress. Then there will be opportunities for advocates outside the bid teams to make supporting remarks. Then the electronic balloting will begin.As mentioned earlier: a detailed outline of the balloting procedure can be found on Fifa’s website, but here’s the short version: each of Fifa’s member federations one equally weighted vote on the first ballot for one of three options 1) the United Bid, 2) Morocco or 3) None of the Bids. Should either North America or Morocco receive a simple majority of all votes cast, it will be awarded rights to host the 2026 World Cup outright.We’ve moved to Item 13 on the agenda. The vote is here. Infantino is making his final remarks and the balloting should be under way shortly.There’s one question I’ve heard more frequently than any other since the USA, Mexico and Canada announced their joint bid last year. That is:The answer: Yes, the host country automatically qualifies for the World Cup finals by tradition, but in the event of multiple host nations, the Fifa Council will make the final determination on the number of countries that receive automatic bids.Of course, the World Cup has only been co-hosted once before in 2002, when both South Korea and Japan earned automatic invites.By most objective metrics the United Bid is superior. Fifa’s task force, which inspected each bid across a range of infrastructural and commercial elements, gave it a score of 402.8 out of 500 (compared to 274.9 for Morocco). The North American bid also promises to generate a profit of £8.1bn for Fifa, nearly twice Morocco’s projected haul of £4.48bn.But some close to the United Bid have expressed concern that Donald Trump’s intervention during the process in defiance of Fifa rules, say nothing of the administration’s incendiary politics, may work against their pitch, even as it’s since emerged that Trump has been lobbying on behalf of the bid behind the scenes. The US president has reportedly sent three letters to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and other organization officials offering reassurances that his hardline stance on visas would not affect visitors to the country during the tournament.Our Martha Kelner is at the Expocentre in Moscow. Her sense is a comfortable victory for the North American bid is afoot after the vote, which should begin in roughly one hour.Mingling with some of the delegates during the break in proceedings and suggestions seem to be for a comfortable victory for the United bid, possibly by a margin of 3040 votes. The session is running slightly behind schedule but we can probably expect the voting process to start in about an hour.Confirmation, too, that the number of federations who will vote is 203. That accounts for the four bidding nations who are ineligible, plus three American-governed territories who are expected to abstain (American Samoa will still vote because one of their delegation has a New Zealand passport) plus Ghana, who are not here after corruption allegations.The Fifa congress is set to resume from a half-hour coffee break momentarily. Item 10 of the agenda is next: Vote on proposals for amendments to the FIFA Statutes, the Regulations Governing the Application of the Statutes and the Standing Orders of the Congress. The main event, as it were, is Item 13. We all know the World Cup is big business. But the raw numbers are no less stupefying whenever they’re revealed. To wit, Fifa’s head of finance said today he expects $6.56bn income during the four-year cycle leading up to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.From the Associated Press:Fifa’s head of finance says he “anticipates strong revenues” leading to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.Fifa’s budget, which is typically conservative and eventually exceeded, calls for a $100m overall profit through 2022. That should help lift Fifa’s cash reserves close to $2 billion.The Fifa congress has just broken for a half hour, which is the perfect chance to explain the mechanics of today’s vote.A detailed outline of the balloting procedure can be found on Fifa’s website, but the CliffsNotes version is as follows: each of Fifa’s member federations one equally weighted vote on the first ballot for one of three options 1) the United Bid, 2) Morocco or 3) None of the Bids. Should either North America or Morocco receive a simple majority of all votes cast, it will be awarded rights to host the 2026 World Cup outright.Our Martha Kelner, on the ground in Moscow, reports that at least 201 of Fifa’s 211 member associations will take place in today’s vote. The four bidding nations will not take part (per usual), while Morocco has lobbied for Fifa to exclude the US-governed territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands due to a perceived conflict of interest (though it’s unclear at this point whether they will indeed abstain). Additionally, Ghana has not sent a representative. Kosovo, whose attendance was in question due to the recent death of their FA’s president, are here and will be voting.Fourteen months ago when the United States launched a joint bid to host the World Cup with Mexico and Canada at a news conference on the 102nd floor of One World Trade Center, the outcome felt like little more than a formality. Even when Morocco announced a bid only hours before the August deadline to deny an unopposed victory to the USA and their junior partners, the so-called United Bid felt like a stone-cold lock.But a constellation of factors have narrowed the contest in the months leading up to today’s vote at Fifa’s annual congress at Moscow’s Expocentre, where insiders on Tuesday said the decision was “too close to call”.Now the moment of truth is a little more than an hour away. But right now Vladimir Putin is at the dais. Bryan will be here shortly but Fifa’s congress has kicked off in Moscow, where the organisation is preparing to choose between Morocco and a joint North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. More than 200 national football federations are to set to vote at around midday local time in Moscow (10am BST) at their annual meeting one day before the 2018 World Cup kicks off.Fifa members must pick between the financial security of the United States-Canada-Mexico bid where all venues are ready, and a Moroccan bid that needs to build or renovate all 14 stadiums for a 48-team tournament. Mexico has twice hosted the World Cup, in 1970 and 1986, the US hosted in 1994, while Morocco has lost in four previous bid campaigns. The president, Gianni Infantino, has begun his introduction. Here are some of the highlights so far …Talking about when he took over:At that time Fifa was clinically dead as an organisation … two years later Fifa is alive and well, full of joy and passion and with a vision for its future.On his belief that Fifa is modernising:Of course we can do things better and we are trying to do this better. We have demonstrated we are a modern organisation. For the first time in a World Cup, VAR will be used by the referees.On his hopes to change the way in which transfer are dealt with:We are working on a real revolution on the transfer of players because we need to put an end to what sometimes seems an ugly image around transfers. We need to provide greater transparency. We need to protect our players \u0026amp the clubs that train players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f38b6be96a8dd90b88ab1d090f5394cac6629e5e/289_779_7966_4779/master/7966.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c46d2c8f4b615972aba143a18fade84","title":"perfect stuffed aubergine eggplant  recipe felicity cloake","story":"A classic Provençal recipe to make short and tasty work of the forthcoming glutStuffed marrows reek of wartime privation giant, woolly things made to stand in for everything from meat to bananas, thanks to their overwhelming lack of any discernible flavour. Stuffed courgettes, with their thinner skins and creamy flesh, are a far more attractive prospect, however, and popular throughout southern Europe and the Middle East. The classic Provençal version, stuffed with sunshine itself* is one of my favourites: a simple accompaniment to grilled fish or meat, they make a very satisfying meal in their own right, and the recipe is easily adapted to other Mediterranean veg such as peppers, aubergines – or even our very own marrow, should you be a fan.(*not really – that would burn your tongue)Many recipes call specifically for the round variety, which can be hard to track down in the UK. They’re an easier shape for stuffing, but if you’ve got a glut of long courgettes, they’ll work just as well – after all, if they’re good enough for Michel Roux Jr, who waxes lyrical about his mother-in-law’s extra-large courgettes (“gorged with sun, they really taste like no other”), then they’ll probably do for the rest of us.Fortunately, the middle doesn’t go to waste: every recipe I try incorporates it into the stuffing. You can leave a lid on round courgettes, if you like – they look rather sweet in Bruno Loubet’s recipe from his book Mange Tout – but it will prevent what’s inside from crisping up in the oven, so I prefer to use them in the stuffing as well.While anything fried in olive oil is inevitably delicious, the process does make the courgettes rather soft and greasy, while those put in the oven raw take so long to cook that the stuffing dries out. Best, I think, to parboil them: it’s easier than shallow-frying them, although there’s no need to do so for as long as Médecin recommends: Wells’ five minutes proves quite sufficient.Peyraud is also a controversialist when it comes to filling her courgettes: “I know that most people add chopped meats to the stuffing, but I don’t think meat makes any sense in stuffed vegetables.” I’m inclined to agree: Roux’s minced pork and sausagemeat mixture is very popular with testers, but doesn’t deliver the sunny southern flavours I’m after.That said, Wells’ courgettes, stuffed with a mixture of fresh goat’s cheese and sauteed courgette flesh, seem to lack something – a stuffing needs carbohydrate in some form to be truly satisfying, I think. There are many options breadcrumbs are popular, either soaked in milk or water, and Loubet uses couscous, but our favourite is Médecin’s rice, which keeps its shape better in the oven, giving the finished dish a more interesting, and less stodgy, texture. Undercooking the rice itself will help with this – Médecin’s is rather soft after 20 minutes’ hard boiling and then 45 minutes in the oven – and doing so with other ingredients, including stock, will give it a flavour boost, as well as saving on the washing-up.I also don’t think the filling needs the eggs that he, Peyraud and Roux put in it makes the mix too wet. However, like Olney, I will be adding diced tomatoes, which will help to lubricate proceedings.The ubiquitous onion is a must, as is a generous helping of garlic, though for a less Mediterranean vibe, Roux’s carrots and leeks are also rather nice. Whatever you use, make sure you fry them first to reduce the water content, or you’ll end up with soggy rice.A good handful of salty cheese such as parmesan, pecorino or a hard goat’s variety will add enough richness to render Médecin’s petit salé cured pork unnecessary, although if you happen to have some to hand, it is a pleasant addition, as, I suspect, would be anchovies.Be liberal with the herbs here both courgettes and rice can take it. Médecin uses basil, which I don’t think really stands up to prolonged baking Peyraud and Olney go for parsley but my favourite is Roux’s mint, which supplies a lovely fresh flavour. For a typically French touch, you might also add a pinch of curry powder, as in Wells’ recipe – it’s a, perhaps surprisingly, popular ingredient across the Channel.Pre-cooking the courgettes allows a briefer, hotter bake, which will give the vegetables a better flavour, as well as crisping the breadcrumbs we all so enjoy in Médecin and Peyraud’s recipes. Make sure the courgettes are tender before taking them out of the oven some of the recipes I try drastically underestimate the cooking time in a home oven.If you use meat, deglazing the roasting tin with white wine and stock, as Roux suggests, to make a sauce, is a nice idea, but there’s not much point with a vegetable and rice mixture. A dollop of aïoli, however, would make a very apt accompaniment.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 30 minServes 4 as a side, 2 as a main4 medium round courgettes or 2 large long ones2 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra1 onion, peeled and finely chopped2 medium, ripe tomatoes4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed80g long-grain rice150ml vegetable (or chicken) stock1 large bunch fresh mint50g finely grated parmesanSalt and black pepper2 tbsp dry breadcrumbsBasil, to garnishHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Cut the tops off the round courgettes, if using, and scoop out the flesh with a grapefruit spoon or melon baller, taking care to leave sturdy walls around the outside if you’ve got long courgettes, cut them in half lengthways and scoop out the flesh in the same way. In either case, roughly chop the flesh, along with the lids of the round kind.Bring a large pan of salted water to a simmer, add the courgettes and blanch for five minutes. In the meantime, prepare a sink full of iced water and, once the courgettes are done, scoop them out of the pan and into the sink to cool down (this will help keep them nice and green).Heat the oil in a wide pan over a medium-low heat, add the onion, and cook until soft and golden. Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes in half, scoop out and discard the watery seeds, then finely chop the flesh. Add to the pan with the courgette flesh and garlic, cook until soft, then stir in the rice, add the stock, bring to a simmer and cook for about 12 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Meanwhile, pick and roughly chop the mint leaves.Stir the parmesan and mint into the stuffing mix and season to taste. Put the hollowed-out courgettes on a greased baking sheet and ide the filling between them, packing it in well, then cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes.Toss the breadcrumbs in a splash of olive oil, season, sprinkle on top of the courgettes, and bake for a further 15 minutes.

But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc32d592e0f057148c0123db4f88caa8e0c6797/0_0_6405_4341/master/6405.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a5295ad0a051ad05c6d4427b1c8a64c 660w","title":"pmqs verdict resilient may sees off corbyn attempts at ridicule","story":"Amid Commons kerfuffle Corbyn’s manner is confident but his script lets him downIn a PMQs almost derailed by an SNP protest, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn again traded blows on Brexit.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, was ordered by the Speaker, John Bercow, to leave the Commons chamber after trying to disrupt PMQs with a vote for the house to sit in private. He was doing this as a protest against the way Scotland has been treated over Brexit, the EU withdrawal bill in particular. MPs were meant to debate Lords amendments relating to devolution on Tuesday night, but the debate lasted just 15 minutes.Before the kerfuffle, Corbyn told the prime minister “the sad truth and reality” was that many survivors of Grenfell Tower were still waiting for a permanent home. He also asked whether May did as Boris Johnson had suggested when she met Donald Trump and asked the US president to take over the Brexit talks.May said people had claimed before December she would not get a deal on Brexit then. On Grenfell Tower, she said every household had received an offer of temporary or permanent accommodation, and 183 have accepted.Corbyn said the government was now working on the basis that the transition could continue until December 2021, not December 2020. Which December was she talking about? Corbyn was wrong, May replied: he was talking about the backstop. Corbyn said he was not sure whether it was a backstop or a backslide. When will the white paper be published? May did say it would be published before the June summit.May said it would be published after that. The summit was not about Brexit. Many issues were coming up, including sanctions against Russia. She pointed out Corbyn quoted a minister saying it would be published in July. July was after June.Corbyn said May had to face the fact there may be a meltdown – not his words, but the words of Johnson. Johnson also accused the Treasury of being the heart of remain. Did May back the foreign secretary in wanting more friction for trade?May closed by telling the Commons Corbyn was trying to organise a music festival. The headline acts were John McDonnell and a band called the Magic Numbers – that just about sums it up.May is certainly resilient. After a run of PMQs defeats on Brexit, and with her Brexit strategy looking increasingly threadbare and ill-fated, she still managed to see off fairly comfortably Corbyn’s attempts to ridicule her.Corbyn’s manner was good – he sounded particularly confident – but mostly his script let him down. His first question was terrific, but he prefaced it with a comment about Grenfell that allowed May to focus on that in her reply (quite effectively) before having to address the Trump point.Then he asked a series of questions that just hadn’t been properly thought through in advance, because May was able to swat them away quite easily. December 2021 or December 2020? May’s always been able to state her policy clearly (it’s just that it’s not plausible). Publishing the white paper before the June summit? I don’t think she ever had promised that (Corbyn may have been relying on a newspaper report – not always a good guide). Postponing the June summit? Such a non-starter as an idea, it is hard to see why Corbyn thought it would cause May problems.Having started with a strong question, Corbyn ended well, too, with a rousing soundbite about clashing egos, which of course will play well on the news and on social media. But May’s peroration was funnier, lifted by what was, by PMQs standards, a half-decent joke.Corbyn on Johnson:When the prime minister met Donald Trump last week did she do as the foreign secretary suggested and ask him to take over the Brexit negotiations?May on Corbyn:I’ve heard that he is trying to organise a musical festival, Labour Live. I’ll pass over the fact it’s going to have a solidarity tent with no Labour MPs in it.

The sniffer dogs which have become a familiar feature of gate security procedures at big Saturday meetings will also be deployed to patrol the queues for toilets at the track, as well as the public bars. Ascot has also decided to end the practice of mobile “hawkers” roaming the bars with beer barrels strapped to their backs, which seems sure to lead to longer queues for the bar, but the course apparently takes the view that the practice does not sit comfortably with an assurance that everything is being done to minimise the risk of anti-social behaviour. It will be interesting to see if courses such as Haydock Park, which has several big Saturdays coming up, follow suit.Wednesday’s most valuable meeting by far is on the all-weather surface at Chelmsford City, where the prize fund runs to £168,000, almost £80,000 more than is on offer at Haydock. Two £50,000 handicaps are at the heart of the card, and Surrey Hope (3.50) is an interesting contender for the one-mile event at around 12-1.The four-year-old was a consistent and improving handicapper last year and ran well after a break – during which he was gelded – at Newbury last time out. He is still very feasibly weighted on the balance of his form. Udontdodou (4.20) has top weight in the valuable sprint handicap but has an excellent record at the track – four wins in five – while at Haydock, the progressive Sky Marshal (4.10) should go well in the 12-furlong handicap.

Looks fantastic out of our window here, not a seat to be found. One to Maxwell down the ground, Agar does the same, then the right-hander keeps the strike with a tickle around the corner. He’s into double figures. First time that England have had 11 overs of spin in 23 overs in a home ODI, Andy Zaltzman tells us on ODI. So there you go.“I get a bit cross about fielders being told off for throwing the ball in from the boundary on the bounce,” emails Romeo. “When I was a boy I was told to do so if it wasn’t a possible run out or you couldn’t throw it far enough. If they’re going to do that, they should also tell batsmen off for hitting it into the pavilion (as Stoinis just did) or the car park.” A thought I’ve had from time to time as well. But the game has changed and we can’t pretend otherwise. Read Vish’s bit on reverse swing (e.g. the guide to ball tampering) when time permits. 22nd over: Australia 94-5 (Maxwell 9, Agar 2) Right, so we only have seven overs of spin left after this Rashid set, where four singles are taken to the sweepers in the deep. Will Morgan just bowl them both out and worry about the maths later? An email in from Rob Wright, which is broadly in line with about six conversations a week that I have with my girlfriend. “An terse exchange in the stands with my wife,” he begins. Me: “Oh, I didn’t notice they’d ended the power play”Her: “It happened ages ago. You were probably busy emailing your boyfriend at the ”.And I just missed another wicket WHILST WRITING THIS EMAIL. Thanks for ruining my marriage and the game, Adam.” All part of the service.21st over: Australia 90-5 (Maxwell 7, Agar 0) Moeen bowls a maiden to Maxwell! In the 21st over of an ODI! Blimey. The Australian doing what he needs to after another wicket, I guess, realising that he has to be there for at least another 90 minutes if his side are any chance of posting a decent total. Moeen’s figures are outstanding: 7-1-24-3.20th over: Australia 90-5 (Maxwell 7, Agar 0) Ashton Agar walks out, prompting every England supporter to reflect on the time he made 98 on Test debut. A real “where were you?” moment, wasn’t it? JFK’s death, man on the moon and Ashton’s dismissal. Something like that. He defends the first couple. Meanwhile, over in Ireland New Zealand’s women are going huge again. Last week, they tallied 491-4 (a record in all ODIs) then 418. Today, they are 372-1 after 44. Amelia Kerr, the 17-year-old leggie, is unbeaten on 190. Amazing young cricketer.The wrong’un has done it but not how you would expect it to find a wicket. The delivery was short and wide so the right-hander tried to steer it past point but instead managed to edge it into the waiting gloves of the ‘keeper Buttler. Not a pretty way to go. 19th over: Australia 88-4 (Stoinis 21, Maxwell 6) Boom! Marcus Stoinis goes big for the first time today. Moeen tossed it up and the all-rounder smacked him into the pavilion. Simple game, sometimes. But I don’t expect that will bother the bowler too much. Some good running to finish, Maxwell racing back to the danger end as they take two and make it 11 from the over, their best so far this afternoon. 18th over: Australia 77-4 (Stoinis 12, Maxwell 4) Five singles to the sweepers as Maxwell settles in. Rashid doing his job with only 15 taken from his four overs. Moeen, meanwhile, has 3 for 13 from five. 17th over: Australia 72-4 (Stoinis 9, Maxwell 2) Moeen continues after the drinks break to the new man Maxwell, who has walked out to replace Paine. He’s off the mark to midwicket with a couple. Bairstow and picks it up and bounce-throws in, receiving a telling off from the umpire. Oh, leading edge! The new man lucky that doesn’t carry to Morgan at cover. There is an appeal for leg before as well when he misses a sweep. Eventful times early for the Biggest Show in Town. “It’s a massive game for Glenn Maxwell,” says Mel Jones on TMS. She’s right. He has a real chance to be a senior player in this side now. Alternatively, a poor series could easily see him dropped again. Scrap that! Paine has got down low for the reverse sweep to the first delivery of the Moeen over but doesn’t get anything like the middle of the bat on it, the ball landing with short third man. It’s Wood, who takes his second straightforward catch. Mo’s third!16th over: Australia 70-3 (Stoinis 9, Paine 12) Just knocking it around here when Rashid is on, five runs picked up along the way. No risk. Not a bad consolidation so far.15th over: Australia 65-3 (Stoinis 6, Paine 10) Moeen gets through this set with only a Paine single to long-off. Stonis is reluctant to take him on having seen the off-spinner already grab two Australian wickets. He’s bowled four overs for 11 runs having picked up Finch and Marsh. Handy. Now Aggers is talking about Love Island on the radio, if you were wondering. Says he hasn’t tuned in yet. We all say that. 14th over: Australia 64-3 (Stoinis 6, Paine 9) And three more singles off Rashid, albeit with a ball that cuts Paine in half along the way, just missing the stumps. It was a nice, big googly - the delivery that the wrist spinner had so much success with against Australia in the corresponding ODI series three years ago. Paine might think twice about rolling out that drive next time Rashid lobs one out there. 13th over: Australia 61-3 (Stoinis 5, Paine 7) Moeen’s turn to be milked for three singles to the sweepers. I suspect that suits everyone at this stage. To be fair, the tweaker getting a decent amount of grip, by the looks. Hard track  spin to win? 12th over: Australia 58-3 (Stoinis 4, Paine 5) I can’t deny that I was briefly distracted by Michael Vaughan talking about Love Island on TMS. Two singles off the new bowler Adil Rashid as we begin the official Accumulation Overs. 11th over: Australia 56-3 (Stoinis 3, Paine 4) Mindful, I am sure, of Australia’s middle-order troubles of late in this form of the game, the captain Tim Paine has promoted himself to number five and he’s off the mark first ball cutting Moeen to the point boundary. Nice, positive footwork getting deep in the crease to play his shot. Paine averages something like 100 balls per dismissal in Test cricket since returning to the side in November so he knows his way around a tough situation.  Bowled him! Marsh lunges forward to a ball that pitches on middle and hits off. Sure, it straightened a touch from round the wicket but not by far enough to defeat someone going as nicely as the West Australian has been so this afternoon. Three poor dismissals for the visitors.10th over: Australia 51-2 (Marsh 24, Stoinis 2) Last over over the power play and Willey will deliver it from the Vauxhall End. He finds Stoinis’ edge first up, but on the bounce wide of the catcher, so they take one. Marsh tucks a couple more off the hip for one. He looks to beat the man on the circle at short-fine to finish, but he’s hit it straight to the fielder. Andy Zaltzman informs us on TMS that this is the first time in the history of ball-by-ball records that an ODI has started with one run, then two then three from the first three deliveries. We can sleep well knowing that. Great work, Andy. In response to my query, David Meiklejohn has relayed that Warner isn’t on the telly tonight, beginning his work on Saturday. That will mean he misses Australia’s first football World Cup game against France, which is a direct clash with the first innings. 9th over: Australia 48-2 (Marsh 22, Stoinis 1) Wonderful from Moeen, keeping new man Marcus Stoinis still for the remainder of the over. He takes a single behind point to complete the successful over. Again, full credit to Morgan. I wonder whether he would have given Moeen the ball had Finch been on strike at the start of the over? Maybe it’s what he wanted all along? I look forward to asking him at stumps. A big early moment.Wonderful captaincy! Morgan would know well that Finch feels an obligation to attack off-spinners with the field up and that’s exactly what he attempts. But trying to drive over cover after using his feet, Moeen wins a fat edge that sails into the hands of Wood at backward point. After looking so good, the opener is gone. 8th over: Australia 46-1 (Finch 19, Marsh 21) Singles clipped the square leg sweeper by both off Willey. Good running from Finch, who takes on mid-off for another. Marsh tucks another to finish. They’re doing this really nicely so far. Spin soon? Looks like Moeen is limbering up. Yep, it’s Mo for the next. Anyone following in Australia who can tell me how Dave Warner went on the channel nine pre-game show? Regards, Curious in Vauxhall. “Maximum respect for your promoting the great cause of restoring the mighty Bopster!” emails Brian Withington. “Quite apart from all his runs he is still a superb fielder and more than useful middle overs bowler. The prospect of watching him and YJB scampering indecently quick singles and twos is quite salivating. More power to your campaigning elbow.” Less a campaign and more a movement. 6th over: Australia 32-1 (Finch 16, Marsh 10) Finch breaks the string of dots with a single to mid-off. Willey, running away from us at Marsh, keeps him honest for the rest. He grabs a single to midwicket to keep the strike. Two good overs in a row for the hosts. 5th over: Australia 30-1 (Finch 15, Marsh 9) Really good over from Wood to Marsh, making the left-hander play throughout with no runs on offer. Looks a belter of a track, so don’t expect many more maidens. 4th over: Australia 30-1 (Finch 15, Marsh 9) Finch takes a couple behind square to begin then pushes another to mid-on. Marsh gives him the strike back and the right-hander takes full advantage, lashing a superb cover drive to the rope. He sure loves batting at The Oval. 3rd over: Australia 22-1 (Finch 8, Marsh 8) Shooooot! Finch leans into a full delivery angling at his stumps from Wood, sending it straight past the bowler in his follow through. Crisp. With that out of the way early in the set, Finch is cautious until the England attack-leader gives him a ball to tuck through midwicket, which earns him three more runs to finish. He’s looking the part early on.2nd over: Australia 15-1 (Finch 1, Marsh 8) Marsh watchful to to begin in response to balls moving away from him after seeing what Head did to Willey’s second offering. That is until he gets one his his area, the left-hander playing an elegant cover drive to the rope to get off the mark with style. That’s Marsh at his best. And he goes again! Short and wide, he slays the poor delivery to the point boundary. Two in a row.  Caught at slip! To a fullish ball that was moving away though the air, Head tried to smash it through cover but edged straight to YJB who did the rest. “Bit of a sucker ball,” says Tuffers on TMS. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Finch 1, Head 5) Finch off the mark first ball, pushing Wood into the covers for one. The Victorian (and Surrey batsman) has a wonderful record against England, averaging 55 in 19 innings at the top of the list in ODIs, collecting five tons along the way. Two of those came in the January series, when he averaged 92. There was some talk of him shuffling down to number five to bolster the middle order in this series, but they thought better of it. Head off the mark with a couple behind square from a ball that did a bit coming back to him off the seam. Next up, much better through cover for three more. Wood sprays a wide down the legside to Finch before he defends the rest from the crease. We’re away.The players are on their way! Australia are all coming down, so it looks like we’re going to get some national anthems first. Just catching up with some comments from Eoin Morgan at the toss, he said they would have bowled first. So, everyone is happy.Actually, scrap that. The visitors were downstairs for the handshakes not anthems. That was nicely done, quickly filing past and getting back up the stairs. Aaron Finch and Travis Head now on their way to the middle. Mark Wood has the ball in his hand, he will be coming in from the Pavilion End. PLAY!More emails in keeping with the theme so far. “I really don’t understand any attempt NOT to upset the Australians,” writes Vincent O’Connor. “They cheated. As a team. They should be reminded of how unacceptable that is at every opportunity. I suggest there is a replay of Bancroft roughing up the ball on the big screen between each over.”So, mental disintegration? As someone who was in South Africa, trust me, that doesn’t always end well. Be careful what you wish for.“Just arrived at the gloriously sun-drenched Oval to watch England take on the Nasty Villainous Cheating Aussies (as they’ll hopefully forever be known),” adds Rob Wright. “Just hope they’re not as good as Scotland.” Also, looks like there is plenty in this Justin Langer chat with Nasser Hussain on Sky:So, what do you need to know about Michael Neser? Glad you asked, I wrote about the other week. Bantz. “I suspect all this sandpaper “banter” may be a bit hollow given none of the cheats are in this current Australia line-up?” asks James Walsh. “I saw Starc was recently at paines to say he still has nothing but total respect for Smith et al. Is the line still that the bowlers knew nothing about it? Or is the line let us never speak of this again?”To be fair to Paine, he has addressed that in a fair bit of detail. Including in a chat I had with him for Wisden Cricket Monthly. That’s behind a paywall (i.e. the magazine is available on shelves at the moment) but the short version is that he adamant only three people knew what was going on and they are all banned. It doesn’t strike me as realistic that the new skip would carry out such a bold lie given all that has happened. For what it is worth.So, Jhye Richardson is quick who is left out with Nathan Lyon also overlooked. D’Arcy Short’s debut will have to wait for another day as well. Eoin Morgan confirms that there is only one change for England, with Jos Buttler returning to the team for Sam Billings. Full XIs once I work out who is on Australia’s team sheet. Aaron Finch to open, so D’Arcy Short won’t be playing. Toss and teams. The captains are out in the middle. News from the Australian camp is that Michael Neser, a Queensland seamer who gives it a bosh, is making his debut. Brad Haddin, these days an assistant coach, presented him with his cap. Nice. News from the toss when it happens in a couple of minutes.The great Gary Naylor opening the batting on the correspondence, on a topic I’m very fond of. “It’s a shame that England are, once again, refusing to select their best wicketkeeper,” he tweets at me. “I suppose it’s fair enough though - she does have a big match coming up on Friday.”Right, let’s talk about Sarah Taylor. Have you seen her innings from last night? If not, find the highlights. I didn’t have enough words to do it justice last night at Hove, but it was astonishing. Spoke to her after play as well about batting 360 (as they say). In news just from the England women, they have brought seamer Kate Cross into the squad for their final (and deciding) ODI against South Africa on Friday at Kent. Danielle Hazell and Lauren Winfield have been released to play for the Academy team. If Cross plays, it will be her first international since June 2016. In addition to the below. Mel Farrell from ESPN has walked in to the press box and reported the sandpaper is being confiscated at the gate. Surrey have confirmed that is the case they don’t dig ambush marketing. Fun and games.Expect plenty of this. And fair enough. ‘Allo ‘Allo! Welcome to the People’s Ground for the first one-day international between England and Australia! Let’s be honest with each other to begin: if not the events of March in Newlands, this would be a white-ball series of passing interest. Now, it’s an actual thing, with the visitors turning out for the first time since they were mangled by the Proteas at the Bull Ring at the end of the longest week in Australian cricket history. So, Tim Paine. He says all the right things with ample dollops of contrition and candour about what happenened, determined to transform the way the team plays, and in turn, radically alter the way they are seen by the rest of the cricket world. Tough gig! To help with that, he has initiated a pre-game handshake with the England players, just as he did with Faf du Plessis’ team in Johannesburg. He picked up the idea watching football in his hotel room after being appointed skipper. As Ali Martin reports, the gesture will be seen as sincere or a stunt depending on the corner you are arguing. The hosts will only have one change to the XI that were humbled by Scotland in a magnificent match on Sunday, with Jos Buttler back for Sam Billings. As for the visiting team sheet, that is anyone’s guess. Ashton Agar will play ahead of Nathan Lyon, but beyond that, it will make interesting reading at the toss. That is scheduled at 12:30pm. We have time on our side, so let’s leave it there for now. Looking forward to talking to you throughout the afternoon in the usual places. For your more considered thoughts, drop them here (please note the new address the old one has very much gone to God). For scandalous hot takes, this will be your place. Plenty of both, please.

Kevin Rushby shares some of his favourite city parks, heaths, wetlands and gardens The only British city to ever win the European Green Capital award (for 2015), Bristol is an urban park-lover’s paradise. Close to the centre is Castle Park, a garden with ruins that is linked across the river by the elegant Castle footbridge. There’s a good five-mile walk to be had along the river, linking gardens and the docks, including Brandon Hill Park. Climb the 30-metre-tall (105ft) Cabot Tower for a fine city view. Scattered all around the city are some great parks worthy of cycle adventures. To the south there is Victoria Park, presided over by the colourful terraced houses of St Luke’s Crescent. Nearby, a real gem is Arnos Vale Victorian cemetery, 18 hectares (45 acres) of greenery where, with luck, you can spot woodpeckers, deer and even slow worms basking on tombstones.Arriving at Glasgow Central, you might be forgiven for wondering where all the green spaces might be, given the extent to which the city’s formidable architecture dominates. Dotted around, however, are some magnificent spots: a top place to go is Kelvingrove, a park with everything for a day out – cafes (try An Clachan), a brilliant museum, monuments, and fountains (the Stewart is a good meeting point). Heading east, check out the Necropolis, last resting place of Victorian grandees. Southwards, the gem is Pollok country park, a lovely day out, even though the unparalleled Burrell Collection is currently closed (till 2020). In the west are the Botanic Gardens, with their fascinating hothouse collection.Given London property prices, you might reasonably expect the city’s green spaces to shrink, not grow. But there have been recent additions, notably Walthamstow Wetlands, a huge area of lakes with 13 miles of trails just a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Hale station. There is great birdwatching, fishing, cycling and a decent cafe, the Engine House. Also new are the Woodberry Wetlands, a green space that had existed since 1833, but only opened to the public in 2013. Right beside Finsbury Park, it is a good inner-city birding site: you can spot red kites and even marsh harriers. Not exactly new, but renewed, is Burgess Park off the Old Kent Road in Southwark, which recently had an £8m facelift, introducing a bigger lake, new bridge and play areas. Downriver from Greenwich, there are fascinating brownfield parks.The Black Country, if you didn’t know, is actually green: Birmingham has hundreds of parks, many of them vast. Kingfisher country park, for example, runs for 11km along the river Cole, while Cannon Hill Park covers around 100 hectares (250 acres). Within that space you have lakes, tennis, golf, playgrounds, running trails and tearooms – this place really can do a full family day out. If you believe that any great park must be in search of a stately home, then try Aston Park – it has a magnificent Jacobean palace. All the above, however, are dwarfed by Sutton Park, a 970-hectare (2,400-acre) national nature reserve six miles north of the centre, which boasts 22 species of butterfly, plus a few rarities. Look out for the startling Camberwell Beauty – unseen since 1996.Holyrood Park certainly has the size (263 hectares650 acres) and the eye-catching eminence of Arthur’s Seat, but this former royal hunting park also leads through to the less well-known Dr Neil’s Garden, a lovely area created by two local GPs who used caravan holidays in Europe as plant-hunting expeditions. Other off-the-beaten track green spaces in Edinburgh include the Archivists’ Garden, one of several small city gardens tucked away from the busy streets. Also check out Dunbar’s Close, a 17th-century garden, and the roof garden at the National Museum of Scotland. About a mile north from the centre is Inverleith Park, which neighbours the magnificent Royal Botanic Garden.Few cities can boast a green space like Cardiff’s Bute Park, a vast expanse of woodland, grass, trails and playgrounds close to the city centre. Its true magic, however, is that it connects, all along the banks of the river Taff, to several other parks: across the Millennium footbridge check out Sophia Gardens – home to Glamorgan Cricket Club, plus cycle hire, horse-riding centre and cafes – then various meadows, parks and gardens all the way north to the M4. Forest Farm country park is worth a visit: the footpath along the old Glamorganshire canal is rich in birdlife, including kingfishers. Also right in the heart of the city is another, much smaller, green space: the Victorian roof garden on top of the Bute Tower in Cardiff Castle.Green may not be the first colour that pops into your mind when thinking of Liverpool, but the city is blessed with great parks. Stanley Park, a classic Victorian creation, separates the Reds and the Blues – the two football grounds of Anfield and Goodison Park. There’s a good cafe in the Isla Gladstone conservatory, plus fishing lake, playground and a red sandstone wall that inspired the Redwall series of children’s books by Brian Jacques. On the other side of the city, check out Sefton Park and Calderstones. From the latter you could walk the mile to another green space: St Peter’s church, Woolton, scene of arguably the most important musical moment in the 20th century: the first public performance by Lennon and McCartney. Also in this quiet churchyard is the gravestone that inspired the Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07260cfde01242affb83264c884267d9485da548/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=579668d6ccf8878350f905d2e15f6a09","title":"ground control paris arts food drink theatre hub","story":"Its terrace is already a cool foodies’ favourite but the former rail depot turned theatre and music venue aims to attract the local community, tooA tiny sign above an anonymous-looking doorway marks the entrance to Ground Control. So it comes as something of shock after climbing a steep flight of steps to emerge onto a vast terrace, filled with plants and herbs, old buses and train carriages converted into street-food stalls, friends relaxing in deckchairs over a bottle of wine, Brittany oysters, chargrilled Argentine beef and pizzas.This is Paris’s Ground Control, which opened in a former rail depot for a few months last summer as an under-the-radar pop-up, disappearing as soon as colder weather ended the open-air entertainment. Over the winter, on one side of the courtyard, the Halle Charolais (a former goods warehouse) was renovated, with heating and sound-proofing installed to accommodate a host of indoor venues, ensuring that Ground Control becomes a year-round attraction, and a big one. The venue, all 560 square metres of it, encompasses food trucks, biodynamic wine, craft beer and cocktail bars, galleries, boutiques, an organic food market (Sundays) and its own radio station. It also puts on book festivals, live music and DJ sets plus.It is part of French rail company SNCF’s ongoing cultural programme, Sites Artisque Temporaires, to transform abandoned industrial sites into creative, vibrant community-minded venues for theatre, music, cinema and dance projects. This latest, between Gare de Lyon and the popular elevated Promenade Plantee, is its biggest yet.Behind Ground Control is La Lune Rousse, an experimental events organisation that launched the project in 2014, with temporary pop-ups in the Cité de la Mode and another SNCF space, an old locomotive depot in Montmartre. It hopes to have now found a permanent home and although the new Ground Control is bound initially to attract a fashionable following of French hipsters, Denis Legat of La Lune Rousse insists that “Our long-term success has to be founded on the local community, attracting visitors of all ages, from kids to grandparents, living in the surrounding neighbourhoods.”While Ground Control reopened (without fanfare) in mid-February, the arrival of summer means it’s buzzing. Inside the covered hangar, people eat at long wooden tables, choosing between traditional African cuisine, Mexican home cooking, contemporary Chinese and the ever-changing dishes of La Résidence, a kitchen that aims to give refugees in Paris the chance to present their ethnic cuisine.The covered hangar also has an organic grocery, coffee shop, a speakeasy-style cocktail bar inside the cockpit of a mock-up plane, as well as simpler pleasures such as pinball, table tennis and table football. The boutique section showcases young Parisian designers, designer furniture and vinyl, with art exhibitions alongside vintage collections of SNCF model trains and nostalgic tourism posters. There is also a dedicated kids’ corner.And, while the terrace is the perfect place to hang out on a sunny weekend, it is also worth checking the website for details of courses and workshops that offer everything from cooking and gardening to upcycling and yoga, as long as you think your French is up to it. • Admission free, 81 rue du Charolais 75012, groundcontrolparis.

After the blasphemy referendum, a vote on a controversial reference in the constitution to a “woman’s life within the home” is likely. “In terms of Ireland’s international reputation, this is an important step,” Flanagan said on Tuesday. “By removing this provision from our constitution, we can send a strong message to the world that laws against blasphemy do not reflect Irish values and that we do not believe such laws should exist.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f9afeea7cc64ae6699702782b6941394b0f4f2f/0_170_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0c46586d4bb661aed7e40574a539ed6","title":"daphne caruana galizia top eu official flies to malta","story":"Top EU official flies to Malta as authorities accused of seeking to delay attempts to find those behind journalist’s killingThe EU’s top justice official is to fly to Malta this week to meet officers investigating the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia after a damning report accused the authorities of seeking to delay and stall attempts to find those who wanted the journalist dead.Věra Jourová, the commissioner for justice, is to seek assurances about the criminal investigation, which has been criticised by both Europol and MEPs.A report from MEPs following two visits to the island led by the German MEP Sven Giegold has highlighted a series of concerns.They note that the magistrate in charge of the investigation is being promoted and moved off the case, in a development that could slow down its progress, and they claim police are not following leads to discover the identity of those who ordered the car bombing that killed Caruana Galizia in 2017.It is further claimed that officers have failed to “fully investigate” the witnesses who claim they saw Malta’s minister of economy, Chris Cardona, drinking with one of three suspects being held on suspicion of detonating the bomb.Cardona and his aide Joseph Gerada were suing Caruana Galizia for defamation over her claims that the pair had visited a brothel in Germany while on official government business. Her reports have been described by Cardona as “fabrications and lies”.Cardona has said that he only knew the suspects in her murder through his work as a criminal lawyer, but that he did not “recall having any discussions with any of these iniduals, and have definitely never had any meetings with them”.Last year, a pre-trial hearing of evidence agains the suspects, brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and Vince Muscat, heard that the powerful car bomb used to kill Caruana Galizia was detonated by a mobile phone signal sent from a boat off the island’s coast as part of a carefully planned operation lasting several months.The three have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, the criminal use of explosives, involvement in organised crime, and criminal conspiracy. There appears to have been little progress in discovering who ordered the crime.The MEPs’ report warns: “The investigation on the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia is stalling. People we spoke to suspect that the plan may be ensure the blame rests with the three suspected bombers and to eventually let them go free, after 20 months of detention.“Magistrate Vella, who has been in charge of the murder investigation, has been offered a promotion to become a judge and should, in a few weeks, leave the case. This is interpreted by many as a way to delay and stall the investigation“The police is ostensibly not following all relevant leads to find out who ordered the assassination. Excuses provided go from lack of resources to impossibility to investigate all people exposed by the deceased who might have had a motive to silence her.“Quite shockingly, the police appeared not to have thoroughly investigated witness accounts – published by international media – that minister of economy Chris Cardona had been seen drinking with one of the suspects prior to their arrest.”In April, Europol said the murder investigation was “highly complex”, involved a number of EU member states and there was “room for improvement” in terms of the cooperation by the Maltese authorities. It is understood that Jourová is to speak to Malta’s minister for justice, Owen Bonnici, and the country’s leading judge, the new chief justice, Joseph Azzopardi, on Thursday, before meeting the officers investigating Caruana Galizia’s murder. She is also due to lay flowers on the journalist’s tomb.She is set to ask about the state of the investigation, and raise her issues with Malta’s attempts to clamp down on organised crime and money laundering. is part of a global consortium of media outlets seeking to build on Caruana Galizia’s investigative work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf65932e2f3a96b9470c2d1161dbf25043147b5/0_15_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e737d215a44db2b4aa02f9a867f2526","title":"german interior minister pulls out of integration summit","story":"Horst Seehofer’s absence comes amid growing signs of major row with chancellor over asylum policyGermany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has cancelled his participation in an integration summit hosted by Angela Merkel amid increasing signs of major disagreements between them over the nation’s asylum policy.The absence follows his decision on Tuesday to drop the launch of an “immigration masterplan” after the German chancellor refused to back a crucial point of the plan allowing migrants deemed to be trying to enter the country illegally to be turned back at the German border, arguing that it would breach European law. She insisted the masterplan was still being discussed in detail.The German chancellor has attracted criticism particularly within her own party for failing to back Seehofer’s push for stricter immigration rules amid cross-party concern that German asylum policy is in disarray.Instead of attending the summit, Seehofer said he was meeting Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who on Wednesday said hardline interior ministers from Italy, Austria and Germany had formed an “axis of the willing” to combat illegal immigration.The claim marks a shot across the bow at Merkel, who is trying to pull together a deal for EU cooperation on placing asylum seekers.Kurz is pushing for more stringent immigration rules across the EU but is not fully behind Seehofer’s plan to return migrants to the country in which they were first registered.Merkel has steadfastly refused to sanction Seehofer’s plan, insisting on finding a European solution to illegal migration that would require enhanced controls along the external border of the EU.Before her meeting with Kurz on Tuesday, Merkel said the issue was crucial and had the potential to seriously damage Europe if a remedy was not found soon.Seehofer also made clear his anger that his speech at Wednesday’s summit was due to be preceded by a speech by the Turkish-German author Ferda Ataman, who has accused Seehofer of adopting Nazi tendencies by choosing to rename his department the Heimat, or homeland, ministry. She has argued that the word “Heimat” in the context in which Seehofer has chosen to use it – namely to protect Germany – is a response to “rampant xenophobia” and plays to the “blood and soil” politics of Nazism. Seehofer has vehemently rejected the Nazi comparison.The issue is set to continue to reveal ever deeper rifts in the young coalition government. Seehofer, the leader of Merkel’s coalition allies, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), has been on a collision course with the chancellor ever since her decision to allow an influx of more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016. Most of the newcomers arrived in Germany via Bavaria.Seehofer’s “immigration masterplan” also involves so-called anchor centres, where immigrants’ details would be registered, and huge accommodation shelters where asylum seekers could stay whilst awaiting news on their applications.The CSU is keen to demonstrate its toughness on the issue ahead of a state election in October in which it will seek to claw back support it has lost to the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland.Earlier this month the CSU introduced a law requiring all public buildings including schools and universities to hang a crucifix in their entrances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d6120b4410e9c16f387496c474108bfb840bc41/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fa6be16bc03ea603ac6051d618ea888","title":"mexico presidential election write in candidate nicknames","story":"Electoral body changes rules ahead of 1 July election, saying nicknames, initials or campaign slogans will count as validWhen Mexican voters go to the polls on 1 July to pick a new president, they will able to choose between candidates including Richie Rich, Alligatorfish, and the Untamed One thanks to a ruling by the country’s electoral institute.Voters will now be allowed to scribble a candidate’s nickname, initials or campaign slogan anywhere on the ballot – rather than mark an X over their names – and have it count as valid. The National Electoral Institute (INE) – which organises the election and referees all partisan political activities in Mexico – changed the rules barely three weeks ahead of the vote that will also renew congress, elect nine governors and hundreds of mayors.Nicknames abound in Mexican politics: the current front-runner Andrés Manuel López Obrador is often referred to by his initials: “Amlo”. But he is equally well-known as “El Peje” for pejelegarto, a fish from his native Tabasco state, whose name translates literally as Alligatorfish.His closest rival – Ricardo Anaya Cortés of the rightwing National Action Party – is sometimes referred to as “RAC” in print, but on social media he is increasingly called Ricky Riquín Canallín – the Spanish equivalent of “Richie Rich”, which was coined by López Obrador in a recent candidates’ debate. The lone independent candidate on the ballot, cowboy-turned-governor Jaime Rodríguez, is better known as “El Bronco” – or the Untamed One. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate José Antonio Meade, whose sedate speaking style and lacklustre campaign has failed to capture the public imagination, lacks a nickname, beyond the perfunctory “Pepe” or “Pepe Toño” – the diminutive form of his first names. Dissenters on the INE board warned that allowing voters to use nicknames could cause confusion during the vote count. A blank box on the ballot already allows for write-in candidates. López Obrador has a history of tagging his critics with unflattering nicknames. As Mexico City mayor, he called anti-crime protesters pirruris (spoiled rich kids) and dismissed civil society organisations which disagreed with him as fifis (posh).López Obrador labelled Anaya with the “Ricky Riquín Canallín” during the second presidential debate. The name stuck and remained the debate’s most memorable moment.“It shows how good López Obrador is at branding people,” said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “He’s almost as good as Trump.”All polls show López Obrador ahead of his rivals by around 20 percentage points, amid a broad desire for change in a country beset by drug cartel violence and political corruption scandals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6deda3ed8d45d6db9a52ac974afa26d42274f0b/0_169_3482_2089/master/3482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d0cfd6202b9e54356b3c00038aafcb","title":"populist talkshows fuel rise of far right german tv bosses told","story":"Political shows’ negative focus on Islam erodes social cohesion, says cultural councilThe head of Germany’s most powerful cultural body has called for the plug to be pulled on the nation’s multitude of political talkshows for a year, arguing that their populist agenda has helped fuel the rise of the far right.Olaf Zimmermann, who heads the German cultural council, an umbrella group for organisations from art galleries to television companies, said public broadcasters needed to step back and rethink a format that has helped cement gloom-ridden public attitudes towards refugees and Islam, and propelled the Alternative für Deutschland party into parliament at last September’s election.“I’d suggest for them, take a break for a year ... though the length of the intermission isn’t the decisive factor. What is crucial is that they return with new talkshow concepts and try to come up with more suitable contents with regards to social cohesion in our society,” Zimmermann said, arguing that the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF were obsessed with refugee-related issues, often framing them negatively.The cultural council, which is taxpayer funded, has pointed out that since 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis when almost a million refugees and migrants entered Germany, more than 100 political talk shows have put a topic related to migration at the centre of their discussion.Since September’s election, which saw the AfD enter the Bundestag for the first time, much debate has surrounded the extent to which framing an issue, or lending a topic a certain perspective, might have helped their cause.Television analysts have argued that the issue of refugees has been dealt with in a mostly negative way.TV bosses have defended their formats, admitting the intensity of the refugee debate led to the topic being far more widely discussed in 2015 and 2016 than ever before, but arguing that it was no longer a dominant theme.Even last week, however, ARD’s main talkshow Hart Aber Fair - Hard But Fair - led with the question: “To what extent is it possible to integrate young men who have fled from war and archaic societies? How unsafe is Germany as a result of them?”The programme was triggered by the murder of a 14-year-old German girl whose body was discovered in Wiesbaden last week. The 20-year-old Iraqi man suspected of her rape and murder was extradited from Iraq to Germany this week to face trial.Zimmermann said in too many cases refugees were unfairly presented as a threat to German society. The production team of Hart Aber Fair said it rejected the accusation that they had unfairly labelled all refugees as dangerous. “As journalists we find the concept of framing alien to us. We are simply trying to represent the issues which are occupying people, for what they are,” they said.A recent talkshow moderated by the veteran host Sandra Maischberger was advertised in TV listings with the title: “Are we too tolerant towards Islam?” Critics were quick to pounce on the word “we” as being problematic because it suggested “them and us”. The programme’s title was swiftly changed to: The Islam debate: where does our tolerance end?Other recent talkshow topics included ones entitled Refugees and criminality, and Beethoven or Burka?Kai Hafez, a media analyst, said that immigration was rarely presented in talkshows as anything other than negative. “The viewers get used to these negative expressions, and long-term that way the rightwing populists manage to press their points home,” he told Der Spiegel.For their part, the AfD – whose representatives are relative newcomers on the talkshow circuit, the party only having been founded in 2014 – have been deeply critical of the extent to which they are excluded from TV debates.Last week that impression was only intensified after Alexander Gauland, the party’s leader, had his invitation to appear on Hart Aber Fair withdrawn in protest at his description of the Nazi era as the equivalent of “a bird shit” in the context of “more than 1,000 years of successful German history”.AfD supporters reacted to the ban with fury on social media, calling it part of a campaign to squeeze the party off the airwaves.Typically a German talkshow concentrates on a single topic for 60 to 90 minutes. Guests invariably include media representatives, at least one member of the cabinet and opposition politicians.Many media watchers have long been critical of the extent to which the arguably tired and unimaginative format dominates German television, accusing programme makers of choosing it because it is cheap – despite Germany having one of the highest licence fees in the world – and blaming it in part for the dramatic fall in viewers in recent years.Controllers of the broadcasters have hit back. “We believe the talk shows are an enriching part of our programming,” Rainald Becker, the editor-in-chief of the ARD told Die Welt. “Of course we discuss Islam now and then, but we also have other topics such as housing, the collapse of bee colonies or the shortage of carers.“And to those who want to complain, I say to them: you know that there’s an off switch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba99ed1fcc0d81d27c9519582c09cd35cc44a652/0_73_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf121d8a681796867cd37fe19bbdd491","title":"were just trying to survive it russian cities brace for world cup","story":"The Russian prazdnik – celebration – must not be ruined at any price as hosts prepare to give enemies five-star treatmentOn a riverboat between the World Cup cities of Kazan and Samara last month, a Russian couple in their 50s asked earnestly whether “all these rumours” about Moscow’s poisoning of Sergei Skripal could lead the west to boycott or cancel the tournament.“Russians don’t surrender to pressure like that, we push back hard,” said Yevgeny Prigov, a hefty businessman who trades in machine parts, echoing a popular Russian cliche.Their belief, summarised, was that the west wants to see Russia fall on its face when it hosts the World Cup this month, and that Russia would pull it off in spite of its guests.It’s a bit like inviting your enemies over for dinner: the best revenge is a five-star meal.“This is supposed to be a prazdnik,” or celebration, said his wife, Maria, sipping a lager. “And that’s what we’re going to give them.”For the defiant World Cup hosts, this month’s celebration of football comes amid its worst relations with the west since the cold war, after the annexation of Crimea, accusations of interfering in US elections, and the recent nerve agent attack in Salisbury.There was a time when Russia saw prestige sporting competitions like the World Cup or the Olympics as an occasion to woo the west and seek acceptance into a club of great nations. Russia still paid lip service to detente when it was awarded the tournament in 2010, and championed a reset with the US under its liberal-ish president Dmitry Medvedev.But forget about rehabilitating Vladimir Putin through sport now.Not that anyone here much cares. Defiance to the west has been enshrined in public policy and the national media since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, with officials wearing western sanctions as a badge of respect.On national television last week, Putin said that the main reason he had not sacked Vitaly Mutko, the disgraced former sports minister, was because the west wanted him out.“We know what kind of attack was made against him in connection with the doping scandal,” Putin said. “Under those kinds of circumstances, it is not possible to have him retire.”The main intrigue of Russia’s World Cup will likely be how Russia’s regional cities cope with the influx of tens of thousands of fans, many of them seeing foreign tourists on this scale for the first time in their history. Security will be extreme.The rule with prazdniki is that they mustn’t be spoiled, not by protests, provocations, faulty planning or poor security.Russian officials still bristle when they recall gleeful foreign coverage of a “double toilet”, two commodes in a single stall, at the Biathlon centre ahead of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. To the west, it was a symbol of slapdash planning or official corruption. To Russia, it was a construction mistake blown out of proportion.A person close to the Kremlin said that the Russian leader played up the geopolitical nature of the Olympics to justify the criticism over massive expenditures, a reported $50bn, to remake the Black Sea city of Sochi.“There were a lot of questions about why it was costing so much, so he came out and said it’s about promoting Russian values and developed a narrative behind it,” the person said.By contrast, the World Cup, costing an estimated $14bn across 11 cities according to the respected RBC business daily, has kicked up less fuss. Among the reasons? The country’s main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who publicises reports on official corruption, was sentenced to 30 days in jail last month, and will only be let out after the opening day of the tournament.Regionally, it’s a moment for leaders across Russia to preen. Down in Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov has already secured his photo op with Mo Salah, the world’s most famous Muslim footballer, as he leverages the World Cup in his push to be Putin’s envoy to the Middle East. Kadyrov reportedly had the Liverpool star summoned from his hotel, where he was asleep, for the meet-and-greet on the Grozny pitch.In regions across Russia, local officials have gladly taken the money offered for new stadiums and urban development, while also gritting their teeth for the daunting prospect of ensuring an incident-free tournament.“Where are you from?” growled the governor of Volgograd, a veteran of the first Chechen war, when I asked him about fan safety ahead of last month’s Russian Cup finals between FC Tosno and FC Avangard Kursk. “I assure you we are taking every possible precaution to ensure their safety.”It wasn’t an overstatement. The city has closed streets and shut public transport for several kilometres around the stadium during games. The security measures and other preparations are so extensive that match days have been declared public holidays because no one can get to work.Residents in one apartment block in Yekaterinburg have been told not to use their balconies, open their windows or stand near their windows on match days, in case they’re mistaken for attackers and shot by police snipers, Reuters reported.“To be honest we’re just trying to survive it,” Olga Khavanskaya, a schoolteacher, told me in Volgograd during the city’s Victory Day parade. “There’s this feeling like the city has been ripped up from the ground and flipped over. The city looks better than I can ever recall … but I’m ready for it all to be over.” Even the hooligans are under lock and key. “We’ve pretty much been sidelined,” Kostya, a member of a CSKA firm, told me in a Moscow pub recently. It’s a tightrope walk, a vast balancing act across 11 cities, and your greatest rivals have front-row seats. Perhaps deep down, the Kremlin may still hope that a successful tournament will earn recognition. But the real concern is not screwing up. So don’t ruin the prazdnik."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49d333eb902e104674ddd68922af9be7b7daf424/0_223_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63dfc234e93a13de3ab022f35424a23d","title":"poland family life photography exhibition in pictures","story":"Family Values: Polish Photography Now is the UK’s first exhibition focusing on photography from Poland and part of the Calvert 22 Foundation’s season of events examining the country’s visual culture and creative landscape.

Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsA sporting organisation in north county Dublin lost hundreds of children because of its competitive ethos at under-age level, an Oireachtas committee has heard. Fine Gael TD Alan Farrell, who is the chairman of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, said two clubs in his local area were the beneficiaries of a policy which developed at another club. The committee is examining how to combat childhood obesity in Ireland. Mr Farrell said the competitive nature of the club, which he did not name nor the code involved, started at under the age of 12 and effectively excluded hundreds of children because it was only focused on the best of them. “I think that is wrong,” he added. “There should be an encouragement for kids to participate up to a certain age where there shouldn’t be competition involved.“For a child to show up and to train just as hard as everybody else, and not have that talent, for a sporting organisation to exclude them, I don’t think that is good enough.”He stressed that excessive competitiveness at under-age level is not solely the preserve of the GAA but is widespread in other codes too. The GAA’s community and health manager Colin Regan told the committee that the association is working toward a “sea change” in attitudes towards competitiveness at under-age level. All under-age coaches now have to participate in a foundation-level coaching scheme, he said, where the emphasis is on participation rather than competition. He acknowledged that it might take a generation to deliver the cultural and philosophical changes needed. He criticised the culture in some GAA clubs where competitiveness starts at the earliest age because “some coaches within our clubs would seek to live vicariously thorugh their underage teams”. Mr Regan told the committee that the ethos of participation rather than competitiveness was at the centre of the 220 GAA clubs participating in the association’s Healthy Club Project. The project was set up in 2013 with a view to make GAA clubs “healthy hubs” with a focus, not just on competition, but on health and wellbeing. “One of their big motivations is to address that motivation within their own clubs. We see that project as a further antidote to the win at all costs ethos that can carry across all codes,” he said. Mr Regan further outlined that participation is central to its GAA Go initiative where children play blitzes at under-age level on small-sided pitches. He said that attitude was present at the Féile hurling in Galway last weekend where players played on a “roll on, roll off” basis. Mr Regan revealed at the committee that the GAA had turned down sponsorship from companies involved in junk food “on a case-by-case basis”. He stressed too that alcohol companies had “zero” sponsorship of underage teams. Senator Catherine Noone suggested that Kelloggs, the sponsors of the GAA’s highly successful Cúl Camps, produced cereals that were “pure sugar” and “confectionary sold as cereal”. Mr Regan said many of their cereals would fall into the “acceptable parameters” for children’s nutrition. He said that since Kelloggs came on board as sponsors, the number of children attending Cúl Camps, have almost doubled. Currently 142,000 children a year participate in Cúl Camps every summer. He said the numbers participating made it one of the biggest promotional events for children in the world.

But the virus takes a week or longer to incubate so it\u0027s still possible it\u0027s out there, he said. Countries most closely connected with the Nipah virus outbreakJake Dunning, consultant in infectious diseases at Public Health England, said the agency was monitoring the disease. “This outbreak presents a negligible risk to the UK public. While southern India is a popular destination for UK tourists, the risk of tourists contracting the virus is very low if standard precautions are taken such as avoiding contact with bats and their environments, not touching any sick or dead animals and avoiding raw or partially fermented date sap.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Some 19 people were infected with the virus, which spreads between humans through contact with bodily fluids of affected iniduals. The Indian government has monitored more than 1,000 contacts of those affected and confirmed that the disease has not spread. The disease is spread through the ingestion of fruit bat secretions, such as saliva. Residents in Kerala were told to wash hands thoroughly and not consume fruit or vegetables partly eaten by birds or animals.According to the Press Trust of India two of those who died were siblings in their 20s who had eaten fruit picked near to where they were building a home. The nurse treating them also died.Nipah is on the World Health Organization\u0027s priority list of pathogens with potential to develop into an epidemic and for which there is currently no vaccine or effective treatment.Last month the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations granted a $25m grant to two US-based companies, Profectus BioSciences and Emergent BioSolutions, to develop a vaccine against the disease.Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the coalition, described Nipah as a deadly pathogen that has already travelled thousands of kilometers, has serious epidemic potential and the ability to surprise us.Nipah virus outbreak | Where could it spread?Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1998. It spread to Singapore and more than 100 people were killed in both places. On that occasion, pigs were the virus hosts but they are believed to have caught it from bats.In India the disease was first reported in 2001 and again six years later, with the two outbreaks claiming 50 lives.Both times the disease was reported in areas of the eastern state of West Bengal bordering Bangladesh.Bangladesh has borne the brunt of the disease in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since the first outbreak was reported there in 2001.In Bangladesh in 2004, humans became infected with Nipah after eating date palm sap that had been contaminated by infected fruit bats.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyWhen is summer solstice?

And as a designer and as a woman who’s been married - I had to do my dress - it’s such a big deal.“It was very much her dress, and I felt very proud that she came to me for that part of the wedding. She got to reflect her in it.”Asked whether Ms Markle had come to her with ideas for how she wanted to look, McCartney said: “Yeah, we worked together.“When you come to a wedding, you don’t just go ‘here, this is what you’re wearing’. That person has to feel like a million dollars, they need to feel like they own it.“The role she’s taken on, it’s very austere, it’s very sort of serious, and I think there’s a great weight that she has acquired through that and she takes it very seriously.The first, daytime wedding dress by Clare Waight Keller“I think it was the last moment that she could reflect sort of the other side to her: the joy and the human within her.“I was aware that we had to get the right kind of positioning, the right pace, the right voice. There was a delicate line.”She added: “It\u0027s either a thumbs up or a thumbs down, it’s that kind of gig.”Stella McCartney, the designerClare Waight Keller, who designed the first wedding dress worn by Ms Markle for the ceremony, carriage ride and daytime reception, has said previously: “I think every bride is unique. They always come with their own ideas.

But he also acknowledged cash-flow issues that have raised eyebrows on Wall Street.“Given that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us”, Mr Musk wrote. “What drives us is our\u0026nbspmission to accelerate the world transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable”.Elon Musk says Tesla will enable ‘full self-driving features’ in AugusTesla autopilot was on and driver’s hands were off wheel before crashTesla crashes into parked police car in Autopilot modeInvestors have raised questions about Tesla’s high rate of cash burn and its ability to hit production targets as it seeks to roll out its mass-market Model 3.

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Macedonia is a candidate state for EU membership.Under the deal\u0026nbspthe country’s name would be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, to reflect the existence of the Greek region of Macedonia on the other side of the border and the cultural claim Greeks see over it. The name would be used both internally by the government and externally when conducting foreign affairs.The accord was finalised\u0026nbspduring a phone call between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev on Tuesday, and in return for the name change Greece would lift its vetoes on the country joining the EU and Nato.Both countries’ parliaments need to ratify the deal, and Macedonia is expected to hold a referendum on the issue. Nationalists in both countries are opposed to compromise and could yet derail the accord.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres everything you need to know about it...Eid or Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, which is a month of fasting that started on May 16 and finishes on June 14.It is an important religious holiday for Muslims and is a day when they are not permitted to fast.It kick-starts the month of Shawwal, which begins with a feast to end the period of fasting.The celebration is a public holiday in many Muslim countries, but is not one in the UK, despite a campaign for it to be recognised back in 2014.During Eid, Muslims will often purchase new clothes for the occasion, and take part in festivals and celebrations.Many will wake up early to pray at a mosque or outdoor prayer venue.Gifts and cards are often exchanged among friends and family.Eid means celebration and Mubarak means blessed, often Eid Mubarak is used as a greeting over this period.This year, Eid starts on Thursday, June 14, and finishes the following day.The dates can be adjusted slightly nearer the time due to lunar sightings and changes each year.This is because the Islamic calendar - known as the Umm al-Qura calendar - is based on the moon’s cycle, whereas the Gregorian one is determined by the sun.As the two don’t align, the Islamic dates move back by around 11 days each year.As well as Eid al-Fitr, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha.Eid al-Adha will begin on the evening of August 21, 2018, which falls in the middle of the 12th and final month in the Islamic calendar.The celebration revolves around when Allah appeared to Ibrahim in a dream and asked him to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, as a sign of his faith.It’s similar to the Christian and Jewish stories in which God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac, but spared him from doing so.During this time, Muslims traditionally sacrifice animals, in Britain this is done in a slaughterhouse, and the meat is divided up among friends, family and the needy.It finishes on Saturday, August 25.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She should confirm this week what she wants from Brussels — no ifs, no buts and no more compromises.If EU bosses think we’re not ready to go it alone, they’ll offer us the thinnest gruel — and we’ll have to take it.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.There’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

Heres what we know so far...The entire debate covers two days of intense debate and last minute deals over June 12 and 13.The wranglings on June 12 lasted more than six hours.The government is understood to have accepted the first two parts of rebel MP Dominic Grieves amendment - which would hand Parliament much more control over the Brexit negotiations.Ministers are conceding that within seven days of Mrs May agreeing a Brexit deal, it must be voted on in the Commons, and that if there if there is no deal by November 30, the Government needs approval from MPs on how to proceed.This would effectively remove no-deal as a realistic option, with Parliament effectively in charge of negotiations.The government effectively voted in favour of taking out a Lords amendment that would have removed the power of ministers to decide when retained EU law can be challenged in court.Two Tory MPs - Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry - voted against the government.The entire debate marks the start of the governments attempts to undo the majority of changes put forward by the House of Lords regarding the EU Withdrawal Bill.Dominic Grieve has said Parliament would have structured input into what happened next to avoid a crisis.But is not believed that the government are willing to agree to Mr Grieves call for MPs to take control of negotiations as a last resort.More crunch votes are expected on the customs union tomorrow.BBCs Laura Kuenssberg urged caution on interpreting the meaningful vote outcome, tweeting: govt source says only agreement is to keep talking, no actual concessions have been agreed, this might be done for tonight, but it is not over.Dr Phillip Lee, who earlier resigned as Justice Minister over the vote, has tweeted his delight that the government had agreed to introduce an amendment to the bill which will give Parliament the voice I always wanted it to have in the Brexit process.If she makes the changes the rebels are demanding, Theresa Mays negotiating hand in Brussels will be weaker because the EU will know we cannot threaten to walk away from their negotiations and go it alone as MPs are likely to reject it in a vote.What we know so far:The second big vote comes tomorrow (Wednesday), when MPs decide on an amendment requiring the government to report on its progress in negotiating membership of a customs union with the EU.May has a working majority of just 13, including the Democratic Unionist party, meaning in theory, just seven Tory MPs need to switch sides to cause a defeat.Principal interest will focus on how many Labour MPs defy Jeremy Corbyn and vote in favour of keeping Britain in the single market through membership of the European Economic Area. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have to be prepared because we cannot afford another repetition of 2015, neither politically nor financially.“We cannot continue the political ping-pong on who is finally responsible for shouldering the responsibility of migration.“Our citizens want to offer help and protection to those who need it, but this hospitality should be shared and should not be abused.“We are not fortress Europe. We want to build a humane but fair and strict migration and borders policy.”The announcement came a day after Spain agreed to take in a migrant rescue ship that had been turned away by Italy.Spain’s new socialist government opened its ports to the Aquarius, which had more than 600 mainly African asylum seekers on board including unaccompanied minors.Rome’s eurosceptic interior minister Matteo Salvini declared a “victory” and crowed: “We have opened a new front of debate for a new immigration policy at a continental level.”He is also due to meet his German counterpart, Horst Seehofer, in Berlin in the near future for talks that are likely to steer the EU towards a much tougher line on migration.German officials said Mr Seehofer was “fully in tune” with Mr Salvini, who vowed during his election campaign to deport 500,000 illegal immigrants from Italy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has taken this decision on his own and without consulting the local party beforehand.“It should be noted that the Bracknell constituency voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.”It’s understood Dr Lee — who has a personal interest in space issues — was particularly upset over the EU trying to oust the UK from the Galileo programme.It also emerged that Dr Lee had even failed to tell his own boss, Justice Secretary David Gauke, that he was going.The stunned PM only received his resignation letter just as she was going into a Cabinet meeting this morning.The PM’s official spokesman gave a curt response to Mr Lee’s resignation, saying only: “His resignation is a matter for him and we thank him for his service.”Last night the Daily  claimed three ministers had discussed joining an anti-Brexit campaign calling for a second EU referendum.A source said the Best for Britain campaign has held a series of talks with Remain-backing ministers about opposing Theresa May over Brexit.The move would be a direct challenge to the PM’s authority as she has firmly rejected any suggestion of a second vote on Brexit.Best for Britain is funded by billionaire George Soros and says it is “working tirelessly” to overturn Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never had one of those before — well, not from a man.”Simon, who later switched to a bright green slinky dress, added: “There is of course a serious side.“On building sites a skirt could easily get caught on something.“Yet I’ve never had any problems in my shorts, other than a few grazes.

research, God would have a “youthful and feminine” visage, and would surprisingly be less Caucasian than we usually believe him to be.The bizarre study was carried out by psychologists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.They asked 511 American Christians to looks at hundreds of pairs of photographs and pick which one more closely resembled their vision of the Lord.They then combined the results to assemble a ‘composite’ face, with surprising results.Historically, illustrations of God have portrayed him as an old Caucasian man with a pure white beard.However, the study found Christians saw him a younger, more feminine man with a less Caucasian appearance than previously portrayed.The study also found that people’s perceptions of God highly depended on their political persuasions, with Liberals perceiving God as younger, more feminine and more loving than Conservatives.Joshua Conrad Jackson, the studys lead author, suggests: “These biases might have stemmed from the type of societies that liberals and conservatives want.“Past research shows that conservatives are more motivated than liberals to live in a well-ordered society, one that would be best regulated by a powerful God.“On the other hand, liberals are more motivated to live in a tolerant society, which would be better regulated by a loving God.”The image of God also varied by demographics, with younger Christians believing in a younger-looking image, while more attractive people pictured God to also be more physically attractive.African American participants believed in a God that had fewer Caucasian features and looked more like them.Professor Kurt Gray, the studys senior author and a psychology professor in the College of Arts and Sciences at UNC-Chapel Hill said: “Peoples tendency to believe in a God that looks like them is consistent with an egocentric bias.“People often project their beliefs and traits onto others, and our study shows that Gods appearance is no different-people believe in a God who not only thinks like them, but also looks like them.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000343941897.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"960","title":"chloe ayling kidnap suspect michal herba deported

the populations of nine species including hedgehogs, water voles, hazel dormice and even rabbits, have declined in the last 20 years.The number of hedgehogs has fallen by up to 73 per cent to leave only 522,000.There are 287,000 red squirrels compared to 2.7million grey squirrels.Water vole populations are down to 132,000 – around a tenth of what they were in the 1990s.There is better news for some species, with the otter population rebounding up to around 11,000.Pine martens, polecats and badgers are also recovering.The loneliest mammal is the greater mouseeared bat.The report said that there was a single, ringed male, which has visited West Sussex to hibernate since 2002.Wildcats, which are down to only 200 animals, were listed as critically endangered, one step from becoming extinct in the wild as was the native black rat.Fiona Mathews, president of the British Mammal Society, which led the study, said: Its probably worse than one in five, it could be as bad as one in three species at risk of extinction.Researchers examined 1.5million records of mammals across Britain and estimated how populations had changed since previous studies in the 1990s.The study, commissioned by government agency Natural England, found that 12 out of 58 species were at risk of extinction, although a lack of data means the true figure is likely to be higher.The 12 are wildcats, greater mouse-eared bats and black rats, which are all critically endangered, the highest threat category red squirrels, beavers, water voles and grey long-eared bats, which are endangered and hedgehogs, hazel dormice, Orkney voles, serotine bats and barbastelle bats, which are vulnerable.Threats to mammals include loss of habitat such as ancient woodland, invasive species that prey on them or compete for food, and diseases introduced by humans or other animals.Tony Juniper, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said: “Its hard to imagine Britain without hedgehogs or red squirrels, but this is the future were facing unless urgent action is taken. There is still time.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0003886858311-e1528885635683.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle official role royal family","story":"The US actress will work with Prince Harry and in-laws the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in their foundation - having already said she wanted to hit the ground running in her new role.Hello! magazine reported that a request was made to Companies House to change the name of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry on Monday.It will now be known as The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.The paperwork is yet to be finalised, but it will reportedly come in just five days.Its just another step to welcome the 36-year-old into the Royal Family, with Meghan and her new husband Prince Harry already announced to be heading to Australia this autumn.It comes after Meghan shared a stage with the royals ahead of her May 19 wedding, with the fab four fronting a forum for the Royal Foundation charity.Meghan, 36, who worked as a UN women’s ambassador, said she would be “very hands-on”.

So yeah, I guess we wait a couple of months and we can hit the ground running.”Launched in 2011, the foundation was set up by William and Harry as the main vehicle to pursue their charitable and philanthropic interests.And Meghan is sure to be a passionate advocate of the work, having already done work in Rwanda and India.The former Suits actress has previously been an outspoken advocate in the fight against gender inequality.Meghans work with World Vision started when she visited Rwanda in 2016 to help with a clean water campaign.On the trip to Delhi and Mumbai, she visited projects designed to remove barriers to education for girls.One project provided female pupils with separate wash-rooms while another gave girls bicycles to make getting to school easier when they often faced harassment during the long walk to get there.Meghan also visited girl empowerment groups, where youngsters are taught to speak up for one another if friends are taken out of school to be married, and where the young women are given self defence classes.Meghans marriage to Prince Harry meant that she had to give up her work with World Vision to focus on her royal duties.She is yet to be announced as a patron for any charities after becoming a royal.The US actress has also seen a huge change in her life - unable to do some very simple activities after tying the knot with Harry."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004130304631.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"its a highlands clearout as stroppy snp storm out of the commons","story":"It only took the SNP MPs three years to stage a mass walkout of the Commons, and they could not have looked more delighted.In one of the most farcical ever sessions of Prime Minister’s Questions, the PM and the leader of the opposition were demoted to a mere side show.SNP boss Ian Blackford, a usually tiresome addition to the line up, arose and did not sit down again until he was booted out.Furious that Scottish issues were pushed out of the endless back and forth over the governments EU exit bill debate yesterday, Mr Blackford was determined to have his moment in the limelight.Making an absurd suggestion the Commons convene in secret - his deliberate ploy to disrupt PMQs worked a treat.And before long the Commons resembled a Glasgow pub at closing time, with SNP members signalling they would like to discuss matters further with their Tory counterparts in the car park.Speaker John Bercow, who is not having a good day anyway with fresh complaints of sexism, quickly lost control and command of the House.By the time he kicked Blackford out - who took all his members with him to choruses of “BYE” - the day had descended into a total farce.And what a relief for Theresa May, because while she had the best joke of the day, she was all over the shop once again on Brexit.Mr Corbyn had plenty to go on, and managed to dribble the ball into the open goal.But if it hadn’t been for the Highlands clearout, it may have been remembered for the day Mrs May made a half decent joke.Who is headlining Labour’s disastrous Labour Live music festival?

If that was not apparent before it is now blindingly obvious after yesterday’s farcical scenes .   Some form of deal has been struck with the Tory rebels which they were led to believe gives the Commons a meaningful vote in the event of a no deal scenario or if the Prime Minister has failed to negotiate a deal by November 30.   The Department for Brexit last night issued a statement saying this was not the case.   We shall find out the exact situation early next week when the government tables its revised amendment for consideration by the Lords.   It is impossible to see rebels such as Dominic Grieve caving in on this when he and his colleagues know they have the numbers to defeat the Government.     The Prime Minister is aware the Tory remainers have the whip hand .   Parliament will end up having a much greater say over the final Brexit outcome, meaning a no deal is now all but dead as an option and a soft Brexit much more likely.   The question then is how David Davis reacts. Will he swallow the concessions or finally fulfil one of his multiple threats to resign?   His fellow Brexiteers will be hyperventilating but their options are limited beyond shouting betrayal in a louder and louder voice.   They could topple the PM but any replacement would have no more room to engineer a hard Brexit than the current incumbent on No 10.   There is more Brexit action in the Commons today when MPs consider the final tranche of amendments to the Withdrawal Bill.   This will provide a brief respite for ministers as the focus is likely to be on the size of the Labour rebellion on a vote to join the European Economic Area.    This afternoon we have Prime Minister’s questions and you would suspect Jeremy Corbyn will raise the first anniversary of the Grenfell Tower disaster.

He even gifted bamboo drinkware to his cabinet colleagues in January, to save them the embarrassment of being spotted walking down Downing Street with some wasteful cardboard. So when he turned up to the Environment Select Committee this morning with a disposable receptacle for what appeared to be a cup of tea, it raised a few eyebrows.  Disposable cups used by big coffee chains like Starbucks and Costa are difficult to recycle because of the cups’ tightly bonded plastic lining. Because only three recycling facilities in the UK can split out paper and plastic, less than 1% of coffee cups are recycled.   Although some coffee shops provide discounts for customers who bring their own cup, only 1-2% of purchases take advantage of the offer. Mr Gove is understood to have launched his crusade against cup waste after being “haunted” by the BBC’s Blue Planet II.

The amendment to her flagship EU Withdrawal Bill would have let MPs block us from leaving the EU without a deal. But MPs voted down the plan tonight after a furious campaign by the government. Theresa May only managed to win the vote after issuing a last-minute compromise to buy off rebellious Tories. So who did actually vote for a meaningful vote on Brexit in the end? And how many Tories rebelled? Search for your local MP below.  Tonight\u0027s vote is one of 15 on the EU Withdrawal Bill. It killed off plans to give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. The plan would have given Parliament a specific power to decide what happens next MPs reject her agreement with Brussels. MPs could have forced her back to the negotiating table, for example, instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insisted they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers feared would happen. So Solicitor General Robert Buckland bought off Tory rebels by promising to meet them - and dropping a huge hint he\u0027d accept their pleas. Mr Buckland said he was particularly interested in a compromise that was put forward by Remain-backing Tory MP Mr Grieve. Under the compromise, Theresa May will still be forced to let MPs vote on her final Brexit deal this autumn. Then, however, there\u0027s a new step. If talks are still deadlocked after 30 November, she will have to draw up a new plan of what to do next - and ask MPs to approve it.  This compromise was enough to buy off Tory rebels even though it gives MPs less power than hoped to block a no-deal Brexit. That\u0027s because Theresa May, not MPs, will still be drawing up the plan to be voted on. This plan was enough to buy off Tory rebels even though it wouldn\u0027t let MPs block a no-deal Brexit, as the original plan would have. Search for how your MP voted here   How did Tory MPs vote? Tory MPs voted AGAINST a meaningful vote. But 2 rebelled against the party line to back it. Tory rebels Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry voted to give parliament a meaningful vote. How did Labour MPs vote? Labour MPs voted FOR a meaningful vote. But 5 rebelled against the party line. Ronnie Campbell, Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann, Graham Stringer plus suspended Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent, voted against giving Parliament a meaningful vote. What if my MP did not vote? There were 12 MPs from the main parties who did not vote, six from the Labour benches, five Tories and one Lib Dems. For those MPs who \u0027did not vote\u0027, some abstain deliberately - but not all. Sometimes illness or personal reasons can be blamed for them not turning up. MPs have to turn up to the House of Commons in person to vote. So if they can\u0027t, often they \u0027pair\u0027 off with an MP in another party who agrees not to vote too. This, however, doesn\u0027t show up in the system. All these reasons mean it\u0027s not always well-advised to harangue your MP for not voting on a particular day. There could be a very good reason. MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - the law that enacts Brexit. Theresa May wants MPs to overturn 15 amendments, passed by the House of Lords, that would push Britain towards a much softer Brexit. It could make or break her premiership so she\u0027s been pleading for Tory Remain-backers not to vote against the government. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a summary of the original 15 Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they would achieve if they pass.  Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. This would give Parliament a specific power to decide what happens next if her deal is rejected. MPs could force her back to the negotiating table, for example, instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment. (1, 3)  For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of the above will be overturned, some could pass if there\u0027s a Tory rebellion. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through."},{"url":null,"title":"humiliated theresa left speechless pmqs","story":"NewsTheresa May left speechless and humiliated at PMQs as even Boris Johnson laughs at Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit jibeThe stony-faced Prime Minister stood in virtual silence for 20 seconds while her Foreign Secretary chuckled during a vintage edition of the weekly clash\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter12:41, 13 JUN 2018Updated13:03, 13 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Humiliated Theresa May was left speechless at PMQs today after even Boris Johnson laughed at Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s jibe over Brexit .  The stony-faced Prime Minister stood in virtual silence for 20 seconds while her Foreign Secretary chuckled during a vintage edition of the weekly clash. Labour\u0027s leader mocked the PM over a leaked recording of Boris mocking her Brexit plan and saying there would be a meltdown. The Foreign Secretary also called for Donald Trump to be put in charge of Brexit talks because actually you might get somewhere. Mr Corbyn asked Mrs May mockingly: Did she do as the Foreign Secretary suggested and ask him to take over the Brexit negotiations? The Tory leader stood up to reply - but no reply came. As Boris tittered, Labour MPs seized the brief delay to unleash a chorus of jeers.  Ashen-faced, she glared, smoothed over her papers and stared upwards as she tried to start her sentence until Speaker John Bercow called order. When she regained her composure she accused Labour of being the party that is divided - and accused Mr Corbyn of not understanding her plans himself. She explained her backup plan for customs - which could extend EU rules to 2022 (see below) - saying: Let me be very clear about what the backstop is. But Mr Corbyn, speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, remarked: I\u0027m not really sure if it’s a backstop or a backslide she’s talking about here. And Labour MPs jeered the words of the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator: Backstop means backstop!  It comes amid a Tory row after Mrs May avoided defeat in a key vote last night on her EU Withdrawal Bill. She managed to persuade Tory rebels not to ask for a meaningful vote - which could\u0027ve stopped a no-deal Brexit - by offering a compromise. But Tory Remainers and Brexiteers were in a furious dispute this morning about exactly what that compromise meant, and whether it could give Brussels negotiators the upper hand.  Speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Mr Corbyn said Hard Brexit-backing Boris Johnson inhabited a parallel universe and questioned when the PM would publish a long-awaited White Paper with the next steps of her plan. He called on her to delay a long-awaited EU summit this month while the government decides what its position actually is. But Mrs May said there was never due to be a Brexit deal at the summit - and hinted the White Paper will be published in July. She said only the Tories would deliver on the 52% vote of the British people to leave the EU - and Labour were trying to frustrate Brexit. Jabbing her finger at Labour, she added: If he wants to talk about differences of opinion I’ll tell him what division really is.  Division is members of the Labour Party circulating instruction manuals on how to deselect all the Labour MPs. Quoting Boris, however, Mr Corbyn shot back: You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. He added: Meanwhile, the economy is weakening and industry is increasingly alarmed at the sheer ineptitude of her Government.  How much more damage is the Prime Minister going to do to the country before she realises the important thing is to get a deal for the people of this country, not one to appease the clashing giant egos of her Cabinet?  Mrs May ended on a joke about Labour\u0027s reportedly poorly-sellling music and politics festival this weekend. I\u0027ve heard the right honourable gentleman is trying to organise a music festival, Labour Live, she mocked. I’ll pass over the fact it’s going to have a solidarity tent which obviously won’t have any Labour MPs within it. The headline acts are the Shadow Chancellor and The Magic Numbers - just about sums them up! The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop."},{"url":null,"title":"tory sajid javid urged set","story":"NewsTory Sajid Javid urged to set up emergency fund for Windrush scandal victimsMPs said those left in financial hardship shouldn\u0027t be left for months waiting for compensation\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporterHayden Smith11:52, 13 JUN 2018News (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory Home Secretary Sajid Javid has been urged to set up an emergency fund for Windrush scandal victims facing destitution. MPs said those left with financial problems through no fault of their own cannot wait months for compensation. On Wednesday the Commons Home Affairs Committee rushed out an urgent report to highlight the issue. The paper cited cases including that of Anthony Bryan, a painter and decorator who was held in detention and feared he would be removed from the UK despite living in the country since 1965. He estimates he has spent \u0026pound3,000 on legal and application fees and owes \u0026pound5,000 in overdue council tax and loans, and last week had his car taken by bailiffs, the committee\u0027s report said. It also flagged up the experience of Sarah O\u0027Connor, who moved to Britain from Jamaica 51 years ago when she was six, and has lived here ever since. The report said: Unable to get work and told she is not eligible for benefits, she built up large debts, she had to sell her car and in March was facing bankruptcy.  In another case referenced by the committee, Hubert Howard, 61, who arrived with his mother at the age of three, has accumulated substantial debts after being left unable to work and told he was not entitled to benefits. The report also described how Judy Griffith, who joined her parents in the UK in 1963, was unable to work or travel after her passport with evidence of leave to remain was stolen. She got into significant arrears on her flat in London and narrowly escaped eviction. Last month the Government urged people who were adversely affected by the Windrush failings to outline their experiences to help inform the establishment of a compensation scheme. This call for evidence closed last week but, with a consultation to follow, the committee raised concerns it will be many months before compensation is paid.

But it ended in a sickening story of violence and death deep in the South American jungle. A cult leader who once preached peace and equality and railed against the violence of the global nuclear arms race now urged his followers towards death. Jim Jones was found shot in the head lying among the bodies of 909 followers - including women and babies. The 1978 mass suicide was the largest ever single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act, and remained so until the 9/11 terror attacks.  Followers of Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as Jonestown, had committed mass suicide. Earlier other cult members had butchered congressman Leo Ryan, in an act that Jones ordered, after he arrived in north Guyana to investigate claims people had been held against their will. He had met disciples who begged for his help amid lack of food and a dictatorship regime. Jones feared he was about to be exposed and so ordered Ryan\u0027s death, with several of his entourage also killed. The cult leader then set in motion the plans for mass suicide he had long anticipated. He called his adopted son, also called Jim, at the cult HQ in Georgetown, the largest nearby city, and gave him an order with a terrifying secret meaning.  In a new documentary he recalls: In the early evening I went down to the radio room because my father wanted to talk to me. He says, \u0027We\u0027re going to meet Mr. Fraser\u0027. And that was code for committing revolutionary suicide, and \u0027you need to work out how you guys can meet Mr. Fraser in Georgetown\u0027. I\u0027m like, \u0027What the hell is going on, is there something else we can do?\u0027 Then my father went into a rhetoric: \u0027This is the cause that you have to stand up to, our avenging angels will protect us, and prove things right or make justice happen, but we have to meet Mr. Fraser.\u0027 Terrified about what was happening, Jim and his brothers went to the American Embassy to raise the alarm - but it was already too late. Back at the camp Jones had called a large meeting at the town\u0027s pavilion using the speaker system he often gave propaganda laden speeches over. Deadly cocktail  Meanwhile a cocktail of sedatives and cyanide  had been mixed by 30-year-old camp doctor Lawrence Schacht and flavoured with powdered grape juice flavouring.  The phrase Drinking the Kool-Aid was later born from the Jonestown suicides to mean a person or group who goes along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure. The assembled were told it was time to die. The first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old son Robert. A syringe with its needle removed was used to squirt poison into the infant\u0027s mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Jones ordered mothers with babies to take the poison first and it\u0027s been speculated that it was to make adults more willing to die after their children were dead.  One eye-witness stated that while the poison was squirted in some children\u0027s mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were in a trance. This though was contradicted when a 45 minute audio recording - known as the death tape - emerged revealing cries and screams of children. On the tape Jones could be heard ranting: I tell you, I don\u0027t care how many screams you hear, I don\u0027t care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you – if you knew what was ahead of you, you\u0027d be glad to be stepping over tonight. Humble beginnings The cult leader had begun as an American evangelical preacher who was certain the Cold War of the 1970s would bring a nuclear bomb. He created a community in San Francisco, California, where he said his followers would be safe from nuclear fallout. Many of his followers were recovering drug addicts from the black community and he seemed to offer a warm welcome at a time when racial divides were strong. But the authorities started to pay extra interest to his community - called the People\u0027s Temple - and there were stories in the press from disaffected former members of the church. Then almost overnight Jones relocated to Guyana, in South America. Followers - to whom he preached about communism, socialism, the US government, the rich, economic equality and ending childhood hunger- believed he had special powers and followed him to the new planned utopia  One member of the cult who survived the massacre with his children, Jerry Parks, recalled a car journey when what he thought at the time was a miracle happened. He said: My son Dale was driving to school with Jim Jones with two or three cars. The lead car which he was in hit a duck and knocked it to the side of the highway. Jim had him pull over, open the door, got out, walked over and picked the duck up in his hand and Dale says he stroked the duck. Miracle He said he was saying something but he didn\u0027t understand what he was saying and all of a sudden the duck jumps up to his feet on the hand and flies away. That is something to this day we don\u0027t understand how to view it, what to think about it, was it real, was the duck alive, would it have happened anyway? We didn\u0027t think that way at the time, because it was too early on with Jim Jones so we believed that it was the real thing. Jerry says now that he never fully bought into Jones\u0027 hyperbole and suspected disaster was on the horizon the moment he landed in South America.  He said: I knew early on that we were going to die over there. He had backed himself into a corner that he couldn\u0027t get out of and it would soon fall in on him. He said we may have to die for this. But he didn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to grab guns and stand out there and protect ourselves. \u0027You have to die for it\u0027 means we\u0027re gonna kill ourselves before they get us. New start In South America in the baking heat Jones and his followers built a town housing 1,000 - mainly women and children. But it was not to be a peaceful life as quickly his methods of controlling a community containing those who had begun to doubt their mission became increasingly cruel and driven by paranoia. Residents had their passports collected on arrival and any dissent was treated with brutal beatings or menial tasks as punishment. Members of the cult were forced to sign confessions to theft, abuse and terrorism as a sign of loyalty but in reality they were used to keep the members quiet. Former member Joyce Shaw told the Mirror in 1978 that Jones imposed celibacy on members, telling them he was the only heterosexual in the world but slept with both men and women. Shaw, who had been a member in the US, said: I saw beatings and physical abuse. For discipline people were publicly spanked or beaten with thick sticks. A man who confessed to being a homosexual was stripped, beaten with a rubber hose and made to march around to show his welts.  You could see that he could no longer have functioned as a man. Another man who complained about the celibacy rule was forced to perform humiliating acts in public with a woman who vomited over him. That cured his ardour. Little kids who misbehaved had to box each other, so did elderly people. Word began to leak back to the USA that some residents were being held against their will in the community - which was known as Jonestown - and relatives lobbied their elected representatives for help. Paranoia Jones believed the American Government had it in for him and was terrified he would lose control, so he ordered his brainwashed followers to conduct drills in preparation for a mass suicide. Then, in November 1978, Congressman Leo Ryan decided to visit the community after his interest became aroused when the son of a friend who was a member of the cult was found murdered days after saying he wanted to leave. It was to begin the ball rolling towards a tragic conclusion. By the time Ryan arrived on November 14, Jones\u0027 health had declined, according to survivors, and he was abusing LSD, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. His once sharp speaking voice was slurred, his eyes were glazed and he was increasingly paranoid. Ambush Ryan was initially refused entry to the town but once inside he was treated to a well-rehearsed musical show designed to show all was happy and well. In fact it would later emerge he had told an aide that he planned to report all was well upon his return to the US. Jones, though, had already decided on his deadly course. Inside the camp several unhappy families approached Ryan asking to come with him when he left, but the numbers were still small in relation to the overall population. On the evening of November 18 the departing Ryan party - along with 30 defectors - assembled at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip to fly back to Georgetown. They had been joined by Temple loyalist Larry Layton despite the concerns of those leaving who did not trust him.  As the party waited at the airstrip a tractor and trailer appeared and hidden gunmen opened fire - Congressman Ryan, two reporters and an NBC cameraman were killed along with defector Patricia Parks, while several other people were also injured. Congressman Ryan was shot more than 20 times. Jerry Parks was at the airstrip when the shooting happened and recalls in a new Investigation: Discover documentary: I had just fastened my seatbelt and was siting right by the window and I heard the guns going off and the bullets flying and all I could think to say was \u0027my God!\u0027 I heard my mom holler \u0027look at Patty\u0027, my wife. I looked back and she was sat slumped over with the top of her head gone. Larry Layton had shot two people inside the plane but when he tried to shoot Jerry\u0027s son Dale, the gun jammed. The gunmen fled after killing the Congressman and the survivors hid in the jungle until help arrived.  Back at the camp Jones used news of Ryan\u0027s death to speed up the mass suicide telling his followers: The Congressman’s dead … please get us some medication. It’s simple, it’s simple, there’s no convulsions with it, it’s just simple, just please get it before it’s too late. The GDF (Guyana Defense Force) will be here. I tell you get moving, get moving, get moving … The poison took just five minutes to kill. When the army arrived they found a scene of unimaginable devastation with bodies littering the ground around the pavilion. A handful of cult members survived by fleeing into the jungle or hiding. Grover Davis, 79, who was partly deaf, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, lay down in a ditch, and pretended to be dead. The children A first body count put the death toll at 400. Only when the bodies were moved was it discovered that children and babies had been murdered and their bodies lay hidden beneath the adult corpses. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Jones\u0027 body was found with a self inflicted gunshot to the head. At the cult\u0027s headquarters in Georgetown, cult member Sharon Amos cut the throats of two of her own children and then killed herself.

Jack Johnson said he wants a younger, fresher appearance after attempting to emulate Goldenballs, 43, for years. The unemployed 21-year-old, who appeared on ITV\u0027s This Morning in 2016, is now spending between \u0026pound350 and \u0026pound400 a week on procedures including vampire facials and thread facelifts. And he claims five sugar daddies are paying for his transformation into the retired footballer\u0027s 19-year-old son. I\u0027ve been busy finding myself over the last few months and now I want to look like Brooklyn Beckham, Jack told . David is obviously very attractive but he\u0027s getting older now and I want a younger, fresher look. Brooklyn is more in the limelight and now when I go to my surgeon or beauty therapist, I take a picture of him.  Jack sparked a major backlash after telling TV hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that he used government benefits to fund his surgery. But despite being \u0026pound30k in debt and sofa surfing between friends, he is not giving up on the dream. It is costing me a fortune and I\u0027m not working so I have about five sugar daddies, Jack explained. I don\u0027t have to do anything intimate with them, I just go out for luxury dinners and attend exclusive events by their side. It\u0027s a simple transaction - they\u0027re not really my friends.  Jack said he was forced to leave his home last year because he spent all his rent money on surgery. But he claims being a sugar baby allows him to enjoy the finer things in life. I\u0027m homeless, well, sofa surfing with friends and family, at the moment because I can\u0027t afford to live alone, he said. I was spending all my rent money on my face. My daddies make sure I can afford the surgery and they give me amazing gifts like designer handbags and clothes. I\u0027m always drinking champagne and eating nice food.  Jack is a fan of the vampire facial [Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy] which involves drawing blood from a patient\u0027s arm and extracting the plasma before spattering it onto their face using tiny acupuncture-style needles. The cosmetic procedure, which costs roughly \u0026pound750 and is loved by the likes of Kim Kardashian West, is supposed to rejuvenate the client\u0027s face. It gives my face a Hollywood shine and gets rid of wrinkles, Jack explained. The 21-year-old also gets HD eyebrows done every two weeks and fillers injected into his jawline. He undergoes regular thread facelifts and dermaroller treatments. I\u0027m booked in to go to Turkey to have my teeth done soon, Jack said. I want the veneers to be the same shape as Brooklyn\u0027s teeth but dead bright and fake looking.  Jack admits his mum is not supportive of his dream and he has struggled to find genuine friends since his newfound fame. But when asked if he is happy, he replied: 100% I\u0027ve spent roughly \u0026pound9k so far on looking like Brooklyn and the results are amazing, he said. When I look back at myself on This Morning I think I look like Mr Potato Head from Toy Story. Now I\u0027m much more comfortable and people who give me a hard time are just jealous and bitter. It\u0027s my body and I\u0027m a grown man so I\u0027m not ashamed of what I do. I want to be famous so I am working at it. Look at Rylan Clark-Neal - he wanted to be famous and now he is.

Christine Humphreys claims she was unfairly thrown off the budget flight from Malaga to Liverpool and forced to pay for another ticket. The 56-year-old said she was one of the last passengers to board and her hand luggage wouldn\u0027t fit in the overhead bin. She told the Liverpool Echo that she asked the flight attendant for help and she called the woman a b**** after she was told to do it herself. EasyJet has backed its crew over the incident and said it won\u0027t tolerate disruptive behaviour.  Christine, who is originally from Croxteth but lives in Malaga, said: “I was one of the last people on the plane and I got to my seat and needed to put my bag in the overhead locker. “All of the staff were busy and no-one was around to ask so I took my shoes off and stepped on the seat, to put my bag up, because I am 5ft nothing.  “But my bag wouldn’t fit because they were all horizontally positioned. I saw a stewardess and said “excuse me, could you help me with my bag? “And she said ‘there is space at the front of the plane.’  “I then said: ‘there is space here that bag just needs to be moved around so mine can fit’. “And she said ‘okay go and move it around then’. Christine said she explained that she could not reach and asked her can you not just do it for me? She added: “She said to me ‘don’t speak to me with that attitude\u0027. “So I said ‘well I can’t grow six inches’ and she said ‘I will have to tag it and put it in the hold then’. Christine, who said she had no problem with her case being put in the hold, said she went to pass her case to the flight attendant for it to be taken down.

She said: “I said ‘what a b****’ and she said ‘that’s it you - off the plane now’. Christine said she was ordered off the plane “to gasps from other passengers” and the flight attendant went to speak to the pilot. She claims the pilot then came out to speak to her and despite Christine saying she would apologise, she was told the cabin crew member had said she would not fly with her on board and “in the interests of the other passengers she would have to leave”. She said: “The pilot was very apologetic and said he was in a difficult position. “I had said to him I would apologise and I know I shouldn’t have sworn at her but her attitude to me was appalling. “He said he would try and get me a free replacement flight.

A 15-year-old boy is to be the first NHS recognised internet gaming addict .  Primary schools across Britain are warning children are damaging their education by playing the game. Teachers want lessons in online safety included in the curriculum. And so Fortnite has become the latest Pied Piper terror for parents who fear their kids are being tempted into a world they have no knowledge or understanding about. Well either that or it’s just the latest craze that’ll come and go in the way a million others have done before, from Rubik’s Cubes and Tamagotchis through to Loom Bands and Slime.  From what I can make out from my kids’ explanations, it’s a kind of Minecraft meets Call Of Duty – a brightly coloured post apocalyptic cartoon world where survivors battle it out (a bit like Love Island, but with greater emotional depth).   My eight-year-old son has played it at friends’ houses and is desperate for it. I’ve told him that is absolutely fine, and I’d be more than happy for him to buy it with his birthday money. When he’s 12. In four years time. Which is, of course, SO UNFAIR. And I’m the MEANEST mum in the WHOLE world. And EVERYONE in his WHOLE class has it apart from him. Fortunately, I like a row. Several times a day. But I totally understand how other parents have crumbled under the pressure of a nagging child and ended up thinking: “What harm can it do?” According to my friends who have given in already, it’s not so much harm as deep frustration and a lot of rows. It clearly is addictive. And it’s not just kids who need lessons about online gaming - it’s parents too. Because tackling this new threat to family life is tough.

Karin Jones, who is in her 50s, said she started desiring sex multiple times a day after experiencing a \u0027tsunami\u0027 of events - including separation from her husband of 23 years. The former medic described sex with \u0027\u0027unavailable partners\u0027\u0027 as a \u0027\u0027few hours of unencumbered, uncomplicated bliss\u0027\u0027. She even claims that finding them in London was \u0027\u0027like walking into a sweet shop with a pocket full of cash.\u0027\u0027 Karin, who now works as a writer at Erotic Review magazine, said she met her lovers through IllicitEncounters a UK dating website for married people. All the men stipulated they only wanted sex and did not want their family lives disrupted at home. Karin, who lives in London, claimed some of her lovers had even been given permission by their wives to have affairs. She said: \u0027\u0027At 49 I separated from my husband of 23 years, began my slide into midlife, and experienced a libido surge so intense I became unhinged if I didn’t get sexual release several times a day.   \u0027\u0027This kind of horniness happens to some of us midlife women, though it’s not getting talked about much. We’re not told by our doctors to expect aching bouts of desire to accompany our hot flushes in the run-up to menopause .  \u0027\u0027Depending upon one\u0027s circumstances, this surge can be a blessing or a burden. If you have someone who is willing to have sex with you three times a day (or more) you might be fine. If not, you’ll need to get creative. When Karin split from her husband, she claimed her busy lifestyle and young son meant she didn\u0027t want a serious relationship. But while she wasn\u0027t on the hunt for a new partner, her desire for sex was intense. She eventually turned to dating sites and apps to satisfy her labido. She added: I didn’t want a relationship I was too wrapped up with grieving my marriage and taking care of my young son, who is now aged nine. \u0027\u0027But my body wasn’t letting me off the hook when it came to sex. Fortunately, I lived near London. Finding men to have sex with was like walking into a sweet shop with a pocket full of cash. I set up profiles on Tinder and OKCupid, but as a woman wanting only casual sex, the sheer volume of questionable men on those sites was intimidating.  \u0027\u0027The website that offered me the clearest route to my no-strings requirements was IllicitEncounters, a dating site for married people. \u0027\u0027Unlike other dating websites, I found a “cheaters” site to be populated by men who were more straightforward and unselfconscious about their intent. It was understood that this was about sex, not finding a relationship. \u0027\u0027It was about companionship for only a few hours. It was almost universally about experiencing a level of intimacy we weren’t getting at home. But all the men I encountered there insisted they didn’t want to disrupt their family lives. \u0027\u0027Some of these men had the permission of their wives to find sex elsewhere. Anyone on a site like IllicitEncounters is there because they don’t want to be condemned on other sites for seeking out what they need: sex. \u0027\u0027And anyone who insists we can live without sex is welcome to do so. But I can’t do it. Clearly, a lot of us can’t. Whether we can be honest with our spouses about sex is everyone’s own decision. \u0027\u0027I learned that dating sites for married people were places to interact with potential partners without the harassment and judgement they received on other sites from those who view the issue of infidelity as black and white. I see the many shades of grey around the topic.  Karin explained how it was important for her to only sleep with men who were still committed to their marriage and wanted nothing more than a sexual encounter. She added: \u0027\u0027I was cautious. After I accepted a man’s request for a conversation, I vetted each one to be sure they were still committed to their marriage, even if that commitment didn’t include sexual monogamy. \u0027\u0027I accepted that by sleeping with me they could be putting their marriage at risk. But I was fairly clear-headed with my choices. I only slept with men who told me they loved their wives and were certainly not about to leave them for me. They almost always said they wanted to have sex with their wives, but their wives wouldn’t have sex with them. Karin recalled how one of her lovers flew in from the Middle East and met up with her in London. She said: I asked him, \u0027Does your wife know how you feel?\u0027 I asked over the phone before we met. “Yes.” he said. “She even tried some of these things with me. I was so grateful to her for trying. But she’s not comfortable with it. It’s simply not possible for her to enjoy the kind of sex I do.

Claire, who travelled with husband Matthew, 33, son Joe, 13, mother-in-law Sharon, 63, and nephews Luke and Ben, aged nine and six, was happy when she rang Pontins and was told she could upgrade to a ‘luxury bungalow’ that would accommodate her wheelchair. That change, combined with upgrading to half-board, boosted the cost of the holiday from \u0026pound269 to more than \u0026pound775.  But they were left shocked by what they found when they arrived at Pontins, owned by Britannia Hotels. She said: “It was ridden with ants, nothing was working, the cupboards were broken, the blinds wouldn’t open, nothing had been cleaned. “There were ants in our bed. I can’t even begin to tell you how horrific it was.” Claire added: The toilet wouldn’t flush when they arrived and, later in their stay, a glass shelf fell from above the sink while the children were brushing the teeth underneath it.  “We spoke to the manager about how disgusting it was. He went in and mopped it himself and said the cleaner couldn’t go in because she was scared of dogs and we had our Chihuahua with us.” Things got worse when they went for their evening meal and said despite only being allowed a half-hour slot to eat, they couldn’t find any suitable space to fit Claire’s wheelchair in. This problem continued each day, with the family often deciding it was better to eat elsewhere, pushing their total spend to well over \u0026pound1,000.  After complaining to the manager, the family said they were given a \u0026pound20 drinks voucher. Claire added: “We could have gone abroad for that much money. We were sold something by the man on the phone that was nothing like the actual place. “They didn’t cater at all for me and it was certainly not a luxury bungalow in any shape or form.”  She said people were smoking drugs from as early as 9am. She added: “I have to say security were very good and quick to get rid of anyone causing trouble. “But I’ve never seen people fighting, taking drugs in a family resort. Our children were physically scared. For people to be physically fighting in front of you is not on.

The Watford-based pub chain - whose chairman backed the leave campaign - has announced that it will sell more drinks from British and non-European manufacturers. Mo\u0026eumlt \u0026amp Chandon champagne is being swapped with sparkling wines from the UK and Australia, while more UK wheat beers will be sold, replacing beers from German breweries Erdinger and Tucher. The switch will affect all 880 Wetherspoon pubs from July 9.  Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin, a strong supporter of Brexit, said: This move helps us to broaden our horizons so that we create an improved offer for the two million customers who visit our pubs each week. It is the start of a review all products in the next six to 24 months, with the object of making our business more competitive. The EU\u0027s customs union is a protectionist system which is widely misunderstood.  It imposes tariffs on the 93 per cent of the world that is not in the EU, keeping prices high for UK consumers. Tariffs are imposed on wine from Australia, New Zealand and the US, and also on coffee, oranges, rice and more than 12,000 other products. There will be an inevitable transfer of trade post-Brexit to countries outside the EU, which will reduce prices in shops and pubs.

We intend to honour existing contracts with EU suppliers, some of which have several years to run. However, we are starting to make the transition to non-EU trade now. Which brands are being replaced? Mo\u0026eumlt champagne will be replaced with sparkling wines from the UK including Denbies Sparkling Whitedowns Brut and Whitedowns Rose Brut from the Denbies Wine Estate in Dorking, Surrey, as well as Hardys Sparkling Pinot Chardonnay from Australia. The pubs will also serve wheat beers made in the UK - Blue Moon Belgian White (owned by US-based MillerCoors), Thornbridge Versa Weisse Beer (from Derbyshire) and Cardiff-based SA Brains\u0027 Atlantic White.

These are the words of Matt Scooter, just hours after he watched his brave son Jackson say goodbye to his little sister. Addy was just four years old when she lost her battle with cancer. Just hours before she died her brother visited her in hospital and refused to leave her side, holding her hand and comforting her.  The two children giggled, played, looked at photos and watched videos. Speaking to  Matt, who lives in in Arkansas, USA, said: Addy was the sweetest little girl you could ever meet. She stole hearts wherever she went. She was so kind. She and Jackson were best friends. Sure, they got on each other\u0027s nerves some days like typical siblings, but they loved each other greatly and did everything together. One of her favorite parts of the day was going to get Jackson from school. They were very close.  That day at the hospital Jackson wouldn\u0027t leave her side.  We asked him numerous times if he wanted to go stay with his grandparents or his friends, but he wouldn\u0027t leave. Matt shared the heartbreaking photo of his children on social media. He wrote: A little boy should not have to say goodbye to his partner in crime, his play mate, his best friend, his little sister.  This isn\u0027t how it\u0027s supposed to be. But this is the broken world we live in. Addy\u0027s symptoms have progressed rapidly over the past day and a half.  Yesterday she woke up as her spunky playful self. While we still see short instances of our girl she can no longer eat or swallow without difficulty and she’s sleeping most of the time now and we\u0027ve admitted her into inpatient care. Most likely she doesn\u0027t have much time left. For our family and close friends if you feel you need to tell her goodbye we recommend you contact us and do so soon. Pray for Jackson. He doesn\u0027t want to leave her side and we won\u0027t make him. Pray for us. That we have the right words and can make the necessary arrangements in time.  Addy, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2016, passed away just hours later at 1am. She went through 33 rounds of intense chemotherapy in her fight against the tumour. The illness affects a sufferer\u0027s muscles, nerves, heart rate and breathing. While the treatment halted the disease for a short time, the Sooter family were forced to pay over \u0026pound15,000 for experimental treatment in Mexico.

The plucky animal captivated people around the world as updates were posted online and its anxious followers feared it would plunge to its death. There were tense scenes as the raccoon clawed its way up the side of the office tower before perching itself in front of a worker\u0027s window where it showed no signs of fear. The drama sparked pleas for experts to intervene and rescue the critter, which had apparently been trying to raid pigeon nests.  Locals said the raccoon had been without food and water for two days as it was stranded on the UBS tower in downtown St Paul, Minnesota in the US. The animal climbed up and down the pebbled concrete walls as it tried to find a way to safety, with the saga becoming the top trend on Twitter. Worried onlookers gathered on the pavement below to watch the drama, while thousands followed the unfolding situation on Twitter, where workers posted photos and videos of the astonishing scene.  The incident also spawned joke Twitter accounts. One account, calling itself \u0027The MPR Raccoon\u0027, tweeted: I made a big mistake. A local TV station set up a live stream on Periscope, and it had more than 1,000 viewers at 2.30am local time on Wednesday. The raccoon had initially been seen on a ledge on the neighbouring Town Square complex before it started climbing the UBS tower. Minnesota Public Radio reporter Tim Nelson, who tweeted updates for hours, wrote: This poor raccoon apparently got itself stranded on a ledge of the Town Square office building in downtown St. Paul, likely on an errant mission to raid pigeon nests on the skyway over 7th Street. It\u0027s been there for two days now, without food or water.

But it turns out there is still a chance of King Harry elsewhere in the world.  Canada\u0027s National Post newspaper believes a loophole in their country\u0027s laws means the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex could be made king and queen straight away.   They claim university professor Philippe Lagasse was studying the laws surrounding the royal family last year, and wrote: According to the federal government\u0027s interpretation of royal succession in Canada, we could arguably make Harry the King of Canada with a simple parliamentary statute He claims that while Canada\u0027s constitution is very clear it\u0027s vested in the Queen, it doesn\u0027t say who the Queen needs to be. It also doesn\u0027t say it needs to be the same monarch as the UK. Interesting...  Meghan obviously has very close ties with Canada and lived there while she was filming Suits. Many of her close friends, including some of the adorable page boys and bridesmaids at her wedding, still live in the country. Harry and Meghan made their first official public appearance there in 2017 during the Invictus Games. Despite all of this, we imagine there isn\u0027t much chance of us actually seeing King Harry of Canada any time soon, but you never know.  Earlier this week Harry and Meghan revealed the details of their first royal tour, and it\u0027s a pretty major trip. However they won\u0027t be visiting Canada, opting for Australia, Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand in the autumn. But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the country back in 2016 with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who was making her royal tour debut.

Mobile phone footage shows the boy\u0027s eyes and hands are bandaged after he was injured in the ongoing Syrian war, it was reported. As he kicks and screams, his father tries to sooth him before eventually placing him back down on the bed and stroking his face.  Pilipino Scoop reporter Rose Byrne said the video, which has since gone viral, is a stark contrast from typically heart-melting videos that show people\u0027s reactions to seeing for the first time, rather than losing their sight. Thousands of vulnerable children are victims in the middle of a destructive war, who are at risk of losing their lives, she said.

The remaining six charges were refunded.Nicola said: “I can’t believe it’s only 13 fines in 11 years.“Given how many cars come down here, you would think there would have been a lot more.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face competition from motherwell in bid bring simon murray back to dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee face competition if they are to make a move to bring striker Simon Murray back to Dens Park.Murray spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dark Blues from parent club Hibs and said he was open to a return – but only if the Edinburgh side went with another striking option.His first choice was to try to prove himself at Easter Road after an up-and- down debut campaign there.Whether he has the chance to do that is up in the air after Motherwell moved to take him to Fir Park.The Steelmen have reportedly had a bid of £50,000 turned down by Hibs for the striker as they look to add to their attack.And that’s unlikely to be the end of any interest in the 26-year-old with ’Well expected to continue their pursuit.A number of European clubs have also been keeping tabs on him since his Dundee United days.The Tangerines, too, have made advances to bring him back to Tannadice.The lure of a return to boyhood heroes Dundee on a permanent basis would be big for Murray, though whether manager Neil McCann is prepared to splash cash on the former-Arbroath man remains to be seen.In 14 games for the Dark Blues last season, Murray managed just the three goals despite some good performances.

He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee.

Neil told us that if he thinks young players are good enough he’ll stick them in and he’s done that.“That’s great for us and a great selling point if we’re trying to convince kids to join us rather than somebody else because you can see the pathway.”The former Livi, Coventry and Hibs man has learned plenty – good and bad – from every coach he’s come across but very much plans to be his own man.“I’ve picked up lots from the managers I’ve worked under – Chris Coleman at Coventry was great and so have Paul Hartley and Neil McCann been at Dundee.“I try to get bits and pieces from all the coaches I see, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent, and mould it all into the way I want to coach.“Being able to text guys like Chris Coleman and pick their brains is fantastic.“I’ve also seen some very, very bad things over my career and want to do the opposite!“I’ve got my own take on how I want to go about it and the way I want the game played.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/03/58be8becc55c2-e1488888951866.jpg ","title":"ex dundee man etxabeguren one of two new defensive targets for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s search for new centre-backs continues apace as former Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren and ex-Tannadice man Callum Morris have been added to their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off 7.45pm.That sees both city clubs heading to Glebe Park in pre-season because it’s the only grass pitch in the area, apart from Arbroath.n Former Dundee United favourite Nadir Ciftci is leaving Celtic at the end of this month.Motherwell are favourites to sign the man they had on loan last season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee keeper malherbe secured move to greek super league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee squad member Jeremy Malherbe has headed to Greece after signing for Panionios.The French goalkeeper was brought in to cover first-choice Elliott Parish at the start of January after the departure of Scott Bain.However, despite being at the Dark Blues for six months, Malherbe didn’t manage to make a single appearance as Development goalkeeper Calum Ferrie overtook him in the pecking order.The 27-year-old arrived in Dundee after leaving Dinamo Brest in Belarus and now heads for the Greek Super League.Panionios finished in seventh spot in Greece’s top flight last season, only five points off a Europa League place.Malherbe has signed a two-year deal.Meanwhile, the arrival of former Hearts goalie Jack Hamilton this summer may see Ferrie and fellow young keeper Kyle Gourlay head out on loan in the coming season to gain experience.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"motorhome owners due 800k as local firm goes bust","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn estimated 60 motorhome owners are owed around £800,000 by a local trader which went bust and is being probed by police.St Andrews Motorhomes was put into liquidation last week after 25 years in business.The sudden closure left those who handed over vehicles to director Christine Galloway fearing they could be left thousands of pounds out of pocket.However, liquidator Claire Middlebrook has offered assurance that she will try to recover substantial sums for everyone involved.Ms Middlebrook said: “I’m acutely aware of the anger felt by every owner at the actions of Christine Galloway’s company.“I strongly advise creditors they should hold off any legal action and allow me as liquidator to recover as much as possible of the value of their motorhomes.“I will very quickly assess the company’s remaining assets and it is then my legal responsibility to refund everyone to the highest possible value.”Clients had handed over motorhomes in brokerage deals, allowing the firm based near Cupar to sell them on their behalf.

redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla

years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly

Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Wednesday 13 Jun 2018 2:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111982.jpg","title":"Stateside search for market dog answers","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED local historian is hoping a letter to America may finally solve the mystery of a faithful dog that died in a catastrophic fire in Inverness in the late 19th century.Norman Newton has been delving into the poignant tale of the canine superhero that refused to leave the butcher\u0027 shop it was guarding when the inferno destroyed what is now the Victorian Market in June 1889.The story will feature in a trailblazing digital project to be launched by Highland Council at the end of this month, bringing city legends and landmarks to life \u0026ndash but despite extensive research no one has been able to discover the dog\u0027 name.Undeterred, Mr Newton is pinning his last hopes on a Scottish-born woman now living in New York \u0026ndash the great-granddaughter of the butcher who owned the dog.\"She is perhaps the last possibility for more information about the fire and the dog through family stories,\" said Mr Newton, of Blackwell Road, Culloden.\"The rational part of me says it is unlikely.

He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful.

comedy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere are few more successful or well-loved comedians in the UK than Michael McIntyre and he proved his merit as one of the country’s top comedians yet again.Entitled Michael McIntyre’s Big World Tour, the show is taking the comedian across the globe to countries including Iceland, Australia, Singapore, USA and Canada.When it comes to McIntyre, you know you’re always going to get a slick, well-timed and reliable performance and once again he didn’t disappoint.But alongside the polished front, the audience got a taste of a slightly more natural McIntyre, with his off-the-cuff remarks and small slip-ups only endearing him to the crowd even more.The comedian’s trademark wit was as razor-sharp and warmly welcoming as ever.McIntyre can take the most seemingly mundane situation and have the audience in stitches within minutes – whether he is discussing bath temperatures, driving etiquette or public toilet tension.It’s this ability to find the common ground among strangers that has made McIntyre the superstar he is today.But it’s not just observational humour that he excels at and McIntyre proved last night he could deliver comedy to a top standard – making him the perfect comedian to fill such a large venue.He skipped across the stage with all his usual trademark energy. A highlight was multiple references to his recent misfortune – he was mugged outside a school when he went to collect his kids only a few days ago with the thugs running away with his watch.Turning lemons into lemonade, McIntyre took advantage of the incident and used it to deliver some of his best material of the night. He may not be the coolest comedian, or an exciting up-and-comer but Michael McIntyre proved yet again why he is rightly crowned as Britain’s king of comedy.He will deliver his final performance at the AECC tonight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"butcher deserves his chance at broch says assistant boss duthie","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFraserburgh assistant manager James Duthie believes new signing Sean Butcher deserves his chance in the Highland League.The Broch have recruited the striker from Junior side Longside.Butcher has penned a two-year deal at Bellslea after he netted over 40 goals for Longside last season.Duthie, pictured below left, and manager Mark Cowie have been aware of his quality for some time and also saw Butcher in their own side after he played a few trial games towards the end of last season.Duthie said: “We watched him a lot throughout last season and had seen him in the Juniors.“He did well and previously when I was manager of Buchanhaven Hearts I had set teams up against him.“He is a player I’ve been aware of and Mark Cowie has been aware of him as well.“Willie West’s dad Charles is the manager of Longside so he was willing to let him come along for a couple of trial games and we really appreciate that.“He played against Cove and did fine and played in a couple of other games.“He scored over 40 goals in the Juniors and his attitude is great so we thought he was worth a chance.“He knows it will be difficult and there is a lot of hard work in front of him to get into the team because we have a lot of good strikers at the club.“But he’s up for the challenge and deserves his opportunity.”Duthie believes Butcher is a good all-round striker and says it’s now up to the attacker to take his opportunity in the Highland League.Duthie added: “He’s got decent movement, his link-up play is good, he’s not too bad in the area and he’s a good finisher.“He has good attributes and we hope to try to make him a better player.“It’s a good opportunity for Sean and it was a good deal for the club because he was at the end of his contract. “So it’s up to him to take his chance.”Butcher will face plenty of competition in the Broch squad.Scott Barbour has returned from Formartine United and Gary Harris, Paul Campbell, Willie West and Graham Johnston will also want to play up front next term.Duthie believes the competition will be good for Butcher andhe can learn from his fellow attackers.He said: “Scott Barbour is back, there’s Paul Campbell, Graham Johnston, Gary Harris, Willie West.“We’ve got a lot of good strikers with experience that will help him adjust to the Highland League.“He’s a hard working lad desperate for the chance and now he’s got it, it’s down to him and us to make the most of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a dramatic way to aid learning at tarbert academy","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/06/18, 6:21 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert Academy primary pupils took part in a drama workshop based on the topics the children are studying.Rachael MacFarlane, a former pupil of Tarbert Academy, ran the one-day workshop, offering 45-minute sessions to five different year groups within the school.The history-based workshops which Rachael stages usually take place in London where she lives, but after being given the opportunity to offer the workshops to the Tarbert school she was pleased to help.Rachael said: \u0026#8216I loved bringing drama to the school in this way.

owners of The Allotment store, based across from the Bank of Scotland on the High Street, have managed to seal the deal with post bosses to restore a service.\nIt comes after a year and a half without a full-time offering.\nMr Douglas said: \u0026ldquoThis is tremendous news for the town.\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank Susan Meikle for stepping up to secure a permanent Post Office facility here in Innerleithen.\n\u0026ldquoSusan has confirmed that the new Post Office concession will be opening on Wednesday, August 29, at 1pm.\nThe delivery of the news brings an end to a long-running saga to reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer

year\u0026#8217s festival, for children born between 2006 and 2012, have been sponsored, with £995 being raised.Such was the response to the goal sponsorship that, last Friday, CDJFA decided to extend it to the 15 balls at £20 each. Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter how dare you laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

ferry Loch Ranza backed in closer to land.However, a huge cheer went up when bits of wood were strategically placed, allowing the coach on board, making for a great day on Gigha in the glorious sunshine.FIFTY YEARS AGOThursday June 6, 1968Trench point gets going.Kier Ltd., the construction firm who are building the shipyard at Trench Point for Thames Campbeltown Shipyard Ltd., hope to start

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.  His colleague Martin Whitfield MP said it was \u0026ldquoyet more evidence of the detrimental impact Universal Credit was having on vulnerable local families.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.

The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

Milena Canning has been diagnosed with Riddoch syndrome, where a blind person can consciously see an object when it is moving but not if it is stationary.  To help understand her unique vision, the team from Western University\u0026rsquos Brain and Mind Institute used brain-mapping techniques to examine the real-time structure and workings of her brain.  Ms Canning, 48, from Scotland, lost her sight 18 years ago after a respiratory infection and a series of strokes followed by an eight-week coma.  Months later, she began to occasionally see moving things, like her daughter\u0026rsquos ponytail bobbing as she walked or water swirling down a drain, but was unable to see her daughter\u0026rsquos face or stationary objects, like a tub already full with water.  Ms Canning was then referred to the Canadian institute by an ophthalmologist from Glasgow, where the team found she was missing a piece of tissue at the back of her brain that processes vision.  Neuropsychologist Jody Culham, who led the research team at the Brain and Mind Institute, said: \u0026ldquoIn Milena\u0026rsquos case, we think the \u0026lsquosuper-highway\u0026rsquo for the visual system reached a dead end.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than shutting down her whole visual system, she developed some \u0026lsquoback roads\u0026rsquo that could bypass the superhighway to bring some vision \u0026ndash especially motion \u0026ndash to other parts of the brain.  The researchers found Ms Canning was able to recognise the motion, direction, size and speed of balls rolling toward her. She was even able to catch some of the balls at the right time and navigate around chairs.  But when it came to the objects themselves, she was unable to consistently identify their colours or detect whether someone\u0026rsquos hand in front of her showed thumb-up or thumb-down.  Ms Canning said: \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot see like normal people see or like I used to see. The things I\u0026rsquom seeing are really strange.  \u0026ldquoThere is something happening and my brain is trying to rewire itself or trying different pathways.

A tally of proxy votes before the meeting showed 29.5%\u0026nbspwere cast against the company\u0026rsquos remuneration report, which includes a \u0026pound20 million package for the outgoing boss.  Around 16% of investors rejected the re-election of chairman Roberto Quarta, who was targeted for failing to adequately\u0026nbspprepare for Sir Martin\u0026rsquos replacement and for over-committing with other roles.  Sir Martin left WPP in April after more than 30 years following allegations of personal misconduct, which he denies.  WPP carried out an inquiry into allegations that he misused company funds, but details of the investigation were never disclosed.  Over the weekend, it was alleged in the Wall Street Journal that the probe looked into whether he used company cash to pay for a sex worker.  Sir Martin \u0026ldquostrenuously denies the claims.  He is in line to receive \u0026pound14 million from WPP, having received\u0026nbsp\u0026pound48.1 million the year before.  He will also\u0026nbsptake nearly \u0026pound20 million in payouts from WPP over the next five years\u0026nbspas part of an exit deal.  Mr Quarta stressed that Sir Martin\u0026rsquos employment contract was sealed in 2008, pre-dating the\u0026nbspcurrent board.  But one private shareholder\u0026nbspnoted Sir Martin\u0026rsquos new venture could\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoset up in competition with WPP and \u0026ldquosurely must constitute as gross misconduct.  But Mr Quarta cited recent comments from Sir Martin, which characterised his new company as \u0026ldquoa peanut that wouldn\u0026rsquot want to compete against a \u0026pound20 billion global company like WPP.  Sir Martin earlier this month confirmed his return to the London stock market, heading a newly formed \u0026ldquomultinational communication services business named S4.  One shareholder came out to express \u0026ldquodisappointment that Mr Quarta did not start his speech by paying tribute to the work Sir Martin did during his time at WPP \u0026ndash drawing applause from other AGM attendees.  Another pushed Mr Quarta about the company\u0026rsquos trajectory, adding that Sir Martin was \u0026ldquoso key to the company strategy.  Mr Quarta defended WPP as an \u0026ldquoamazing business that \u0026ldquocan succeed without him (Sir Martin), though he added that WPP needs to find a \u0026ldquonew beating heart for the group.  The company\u0026rsquos perceived lack of succession planning for Sir Martin\u0026rsquos\u0026nbspposition took centre stage, with one shareholder asking whether the chairman could admit \u0026ldquosuccession planning at WPP was inadequate.  \u0026ldquoCertainly none of us foresaw the events that followed, Mr Quarta said, but he added that board discussions with Sir Martin had \u0026ldquoenabled us to get to the appointment of both Mark (Read) and Andrew (Scott) when the time came.  After Sir Martin\u0026rsquos departure, Mr Quarta was\u0026nbspmade executive chairman, while Mr Read, chief executive of WPP\u0026rsquos Wunderman business, and Mr Scott, European chief operating officer, have been made joint operating chiefs.  Mr Quarta said that, given the company did not anticipate the timing of Sir Martin\u0026rsquos departure, it was \u0026ldquonot possible to do any further work on succession \u0026ldquountil that time crystallised.  \u0026ldquoFrom my standpoint, I\u0026hellip believe we did \u0026ndash and are doing \u0026ndash exactly what we\u0026rsquove said from the beginning.  Responding to allegations about Sir Martin\u0026rsquos behaviour towards WPP staff, the chairman added: \u0026ldquoI want to make it clear that, at WPP \u0026ndash as in any other workplace \u0026ndash everyone is entitled to be treated with respect.  \u0026ldquoThe board takes this matter very seriously and has asked the new management team to review how our policies are put into practice and where and how we need to make improvements."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7526951.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Petition over Cockenzie site taken to Holyrood","story":"              PRESSURE has been piled on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos planning minister as local politicians demanded he reverse a decision to call in plans for the former Cockenzie Power Station site.

While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.

Gardens and places to socialise will be a major priority along with the provision of garden sheds and barbecue and picnic areas.

In a statement at Holyrood Further and Higher Education Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville announced that the threshold for higher education bursaries would be raised from \u0026pound19,000 to \u0026pound21,000 from 2019/20.  Bursary support for the poorest young students in higher education will be increased from \u0026pound1,875 to \u0026pound2,000 a year.  Combined the two measures will benefit 13,500 students, she said.  Support for the poorest independent students will also rise from \u0026pound875 a year to \u0026pound1,000 benefiting nearly 18,000.  Bursary support in further education will also rise to up to \u0026pound4,500 a year, with all eligible students aged 18 and over receiving a guaranteed bursary award.  The minister was expanding on steps set out by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the SNP conference in Aberdeen at the weekend, including more than \u0026pound21 million of investment, an increase in the bursary for care-experienced students to \u0026pound8,100 and raising the repayment threshold for student loans to \u0026pound25,000.  Ms Somerville said: \"Any changes being introduced or considered are with the poorest students at the forefront of my thinking.  \"I want to ensure that any prospective student, regardless of their background, are equipped with what they need to fulfil their potential.\"  She said the government would further investigate other areas highlighted in a recent review, including support for students on benefits, part-time and disabled students and carers, with a forthcoming consultation.  Tory MSP Liz Smith pointed out that bursary support for the poorest students in higher education was \u0026pound2,640 in 2013.  She also urged the government to explain why the full range of changes were not going to be made until 2021 and said she was disappointed that part-time students \"received scant mention\" in the statement.  Labour\u0027s Iain Gray said the government was \"refusing\" to abide by a key recommendation of the review that all students should have access to the equivalent of the real living wage, \u0026pound8,100.  He said: \"Meanwhile the increase in higher education grants does not even restore them to what they were in 2013 in real terms.  \"Yet again it is going to pile even more debt onto students.\"  He urged the minister to \"do the right thing and restore grants to levels the SNP found them at when they came to power\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Adam Kennedy  How I lost the head     and found myself","story":"              I can remember the night vividly. I was playing football with a few of my friends at the local pitches. The rage that hit me as we were knocked out of the tournament was like never before. I can remember being so angry that I kicked the bags next to the goals containing our stuff, smashing a friend\u0026rsquos phone screen in the process. The rest of the boys were laughing as I was going ballistic and this was all over a game of football \u0026ndash I regret it to this day but looking back it was just what I\u0026rsquod needed.  I knew at this point that there was something wrong with me. For the rest of evening, I said nothing apart from apologising to my friend about his screen and offering to pay for a new one. I had never wanted to cry so much in my life but I held it together as I didn\u0026rsquot want to totally embarrass myself in front of my friends.  As soon as I got home, I rushed upstairs, avoiding any conversation with my family. I knew exactly the person to ring, my gran. She was the best listener anyone could have hoped for \u0026ndash always looking to help anybody out. I poured my heart out, told her every issue I\u0026rsquod ever had in the run up to this point whether it be substance abuse, entire summers spent solely in my room or the fact that my confidence with girls was at an all-time low. I didn\u0026rsquot particularly want to do anything or go anywhere, even pulling out of a boys\u0026rsquo holiday with some of my best friends.  I was spending days at school, working at McDonald\u0026rsquos at the weekends and not enjoying a single minute of it. Rejection from Heriot-Watt University. Rejection from IKEA looking to upgrade my part-time job made me feel like a total loser.  I\u0026rsquod been made Head Boy at Penicuik High School but felt like a below average student and kept saying that I\u0026rsquod been appointed because \u0026ldquothe staff felt sorry for me.  As I sat there, blubbing away, my gran told me to see a doctor. It was her that took me to my first doctor\u0026rsquos appointment and then counselling session. We\u0026rsquod had my future counsellor, obviously I didn\u0026rsquot know at the time, from MYPAS (Midlothian Young People\u0026rsquos Advice Service) speak to the school and I had previously put my name down on the sly but the doctor arranged an appointment sooner for me knowing that I was in trouble.  The counselling was great. It\u0026rsquos an experience that I went into with the most pessimistic approach possible. I couldn\u0026rsquot have seen how talking to a complete stranger who didn\u0026rsquot know me, my family, friends or girlfriend was in any way going to benefit me given she couldn\u0026rsquot put names to faces and wouldn\u0026rsquot know them if she bumped into them in the street. My counsellor, Angela Robb, was excellent and didn\u0026rsquot care about them, this was about me and what I was going through. I saw her for 12 sessions, because when I\u0026rsquod got to the end of my initial 10, I felt as though I wasn\u0026rsquot necessarily \u0026lsquothere\u0026rsquo yet so she was able to provide me with more sessions.  Robb said: \u0026ldquoCounselling is unique to each client and whilst there are some common factors in every therapeutic relationship, I tailor how I work, taking my lead from each person. It\u0026rsquos key to successful counselling to be able to form safe and trusting therapeutic relationships. I feel that I do this and my client\u0026rsquos outcomes and feedback suggest this is true.  But it was not only me going through such a horrendous ordeal. Some of the statistics and facts are alarming. According to menshealth, 9% of men go through depression on a daily basis, more than 6 million men. On top of that, 3 million men are hit with a form of anxiety every day.  Why is this the case? I spoke to Jane Anderson, a mental health nurse at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline.  \u0026ldquoI have been a mental health nurse for eight years and have probably nursed hundreds of patients, some you\u0026rsquoll never see again and others I\u0026rsquove nursed several times. As difficult as it can be some days it is also very rewarding.  Anderson says: \u0026ldquoWe are a recovery focused ward and building a therapeutic relationship initially with patients can be challenging. However, when there is an understanding that our goals are the same \u0026ndash ie to get a better level of health and be discharged \u0026ndash working alongside a patient developing care plans to suit their individual needs and treating people with respect. I don\u0026rsquot expect thanks but even seeing someone smile when they have been so unwell is a fantastic feeling.  She said there was still an unwillingness among men to admit that they have a mental health issue. \u0026ldquoBy the time they are admitted either informally of formally [sectioned under the mental health act] there is some recognition from the person that they are unwell. In the community, however, stigma is still very prevalent. The perception that males are raised to be stoic, brave and strong further enforces this belief.  I asked her what factors could lead to compound mental health issues. \u0026ldquoLack of knowledge and understanding, embarrassment, feeling of failure, fear of letting others down and looking weak, Anderson said. \u0026ldquoThis can be a generational issue, older males are less likely to be open about their mental health, younger males are more open although don\u0026rsquot necessarily accept it.  Although there is more discussion of these issues in society than ever before, I began to wonder what more could be done to raise awareness. I asked Anderson if she felt that men could be reached by information during entertainment and sporting events.  She said: \u0026ldquoI suppose the \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo is that mental health isn\u0026rsquot a nice happy topic so would turn people off from watching. We live in a consumer society, happiness and laughter brings viewers and readers and makes money for the big television and media companies.  I\u0026rsquom a huge football fan and it amazes me when I see people literally living my dream who aren\u0026rsquot entirely satisfied and perhaps feel that they never will be. The cases in Scotland with David Cox of Cowdenbeath who was taunted by a rival fan, \u0026ldquoAway and hang yourself and do it right this time, and James Keatings (formerly of my beloved Heart of Midlothian) recently sharing his battles on Twitter despite playing for three of the country\u0026rsquos biggest clubs. Even a Barcelona academy graduate, Bojan Krkic, came out and said: \u0026ldquoI had anxiety attacks but no one wants to talk about that. Football\u0026rsquos not interested.  That speaks volumes to me about the prevalence of mental health problems. Krkic has graduated from one of the leading academies in world football, has played in several of Europe\u0026rsquos major leagues (Spain, Italy, England, Germany and the Netherlands) and has presumably amassed a healthy standard of living through an astronomical wage but still suffers.  It\u0027s not a new problem. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was said to have reportedly experienced severe depression and supposedly contemplated suicide, often weeping uncontrollably. A key figure in the scientific revolution, Sir Isaac Newton, was seemingly psychotic, and prone to dramatic mood swings with numerous authors suggesting he was bipolar or schizophrenic. Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most famous artists of all time, was another affected. His enthusiasm for art came along with his fast-paced painting followed by deep depression and an apparent bipolar disorder.  In more recent times, many in the entertainment industry have committed suicide due to mental health problems. Frightened Rabbit\u0027s singer Scott Hutchison and the actor Robin Williams are all examples of people who, seemingly with the world at their feet, who have taken their own lives. It should never have to be this way.  Some may see suicide as the brave way out but the most courageous act you can take if you are suffering is to do something about it yourself and surround yourself with a loving family, supportive friends and people that ultimately want to put you right.  And, please, please, get help.

New legislation being introduced to Holyrood would hand councils extra powers to prohibit parking on pavements and double parking.  Previous efforts to address the issue were held up by various complications, including whether the necessary powers were devolved to Scotland.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos wide-ranging Transport Bill also aims to give councils more flexibility in running bus services, through working with operators, local franchising or running services themselves.  It also allows for the creation of low emission zones \u0026ndash such as that proposed in Glasgow \u0026ndash which will be under civil rather than criminal enforcement.  Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.  The new proposals would also strengthen the technology underpinning \u0026ldquosmart ticketing, which could eventually allow all journeys on Scotland\u0026rsquos bus, rail, ferry, subway and tram networks to be linked into one payment system.  But critics described the legislation as a \"missed opportunity\" \u0026ndash insisting many of the measures don\u0026rsquot go far enough.  Scottish Labour\u0027s Colin Smyth said the SNP\u0026rsquos plans would mean \"public ownership of bus routes can only happen in very restricted circumstances.  He said: \"This would leave local councils picking up the pieces, running the very few loss-making routes whilst transport tycoons line their pockets on the rest of the bus network.\"  Green MSP John Finnie said: \"While we are pleased the Bill includes provision for local authorities to provide their own bus routes in areas where communities have been left behind by private operators, it is disappointing that it does not allow for the re-regulation of buses so that local authorities can choose to bring all bus services under public ownership.  \"There\u0027s also not a single mention for trains. This was an opportunity for the government to pave the way for a public bid for the ScotRail franchise and disappointingly they haven\u0027t taken it.\"  Scottish Conservative Donald Cameron MSP said some of the proposals would \u0026ldquoexacerbate feelings that the Scottish Government has an anti-car agenda."},{"url":null,"title":"Report  Transfer teachers between schools every five years to raise standards","story":"              MOVING teachers between schools every five years can help raise standards, according to international experts.  A major report on schools in the developed world said staff rotation in Japan and Korea helped spread innovative teaching techniques.  The OECD report also highlighted cash incentives as a way of attracting the best teachers to schools in deprived areas.  And there was a boost to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos policy of giving more power to headteachers.  The Effective Teacher Policies report said letting schools hire staff - a key plank of Education Secretary John Swinney\u0026rsquos reforms - led to improvements in pupil performance.  The report said: \u0026ldquoCountries with strong centralised traditions of teacher management could consider creating a mobility requirement, such as exists in Japan and Korea.  \u0026ldquoToo limited mobility of teachers between schools ... can hinder the spread of new ideas and approaches.  \u0026ldquoBy introducing a requirement for teacher mobility every five to seven years might stimulate continuous professional growth while also ensuring that effective teachers are fairly distributed across schools.  The report said opponents of school autonomy often voiced concerns that greater independence would lead to an education system that exacerbated economic and social inequities.  But it added: \u0026ldquoIn fact, many countries have been able to combine extensive autonomy with strong incentives to ensure schools prioritise student learning.  \u0026ldquoIf school leaders have some freedom to adapt teachers\u0026rsquo responsibilities, working conditions and pay to reflect the difficulty of tasks, they are better able to attract the most talented teachers to the most challenging classrooms.  \u0026ldquoOn average increases in school responsibility for selecting teachers for hire were associated with improvements in student achievement.  However, the report warned against giving more power to headteachers over hiring of staff too quickly.  \u0026ldquoSchool leaders\u0026rsquo capacity to manage human resources cannot be created overnight, it said.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said moving teachers between schools could be disruptive for staff and children.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod prefer the priority to be making sure every school has the teachers it needs and that those teachers are of the highest calibre.  Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers\u0026rsquo Association, said the union would be interested in discussing the idea.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers should be encouraged to work across different schools to gain experience and pass on knowledge.  \u0026ldquoHowever, those who move across schools would need to be paid for the additional responsibilities and experience.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union highlighted another of the report\u0027s findings - that countries which paid the highest salaries had fewer difficulties recruiting.  He said: \"Improving salaries is essential in making teaching a more attractive and desirable career option for highly qualified students.  \"In Scotland, teacher salaries have been eroded over the past decade.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said its education reforms were focused on giving schools and headteachers more power and money to raise standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are based on international evidence of how high-performing education systems work \u0026ndash delivering extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"Landmark surgery helps baby boy to reach his first birthday","story":"              Little Noah Connell\u0026rsquos parents were told several times that their baby boy was going to die.  With rare facial deformities which mean his life is at risk every day, the tot has undergone eight gruelling operations in his young life - including one surgery which was the first of its kind anywhere in the world.  Even swallowing his own saliva or a drop of rain could kill him, but against all odds the determined toddler has survived to celebrate his first birthday.  His parents, Jade Gordon, 19, and Kieran Connell, 17, said was a \u0026ldquomassive milestone for the whole family.  Miss Gordon, from Robroyston, Glasgow, said: \u0026ldquoWe were told on numerous occasions that Noah wasn\u0026rsquot going to make it.  \u0026ldquoFor anyone, their baby reaching one is a big deal, but it was a bit bigger for us because we have had so many hurdles to overcome.  \u0026ldquoHe had a birthday party with all our friends and family at a soft play area and then went to Blair Drummond Safari Park, who set up a special visit for us.  \u0026ldquoIt was really emotional, it\u0026rsquos amazing how much he has come on in the last year.  \u0026ldquoIt is a massive milestone for us and Noah. \u0026ldquo  Noah\u0026rsquos arrival into the world was a massive shock to his parents as Miss Gordon didn\u0026rsquot know she was pregnant.  She was suffering from bad stomach pains which turned out to be labour.  However, her surprise quickly gave way to worry as it became clear that something was wrong with the baby.  Doctors knew instantly that something was wrong with Noah, who was born \u0026ldquolooking like he had no jaw.  His condition, known as hemifacial microsomia, means the lower half of one side of the face is underdeveloped and does not grow normally.  He also has Pierre Robin syndrome \u0026ndash a congenital condition of facial abnormalities which causes problems in feeding and breathing.  He has a small neck, floppy airway and cleft palate and part of his spine is also missing.  The toddler\u0026rsquos condition is so severe that he cannot eat or drink because of the effect on his airway.  He is fed through a gastro tube and he can only have 620ml of a high-calorie solution every day to help him pile weight on and grow.  His mother explained that even being sick or swallowing a drop of rain could be enough to kill him.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen he was born he looked like he had no jaw at all.  \u0026ldquoHe can\u0026rsquot eat or drink. Even one drop of rain could be fatal for him.  \u0026ldquoAnd we spend hours giving him a bath because it\u0026rsquos so dangerous.  \u0026ldquoLast weekend Noah was sick and choked He went purple and stopped breathing for between 10 and 30 seconds. We were blue-lighted to the hospital.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos scary but it\u0026rsquos just our normal - he is a happy wee boy.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how to feed a baby or make a bottle up. But dealing with tubes and wires are all normal to us because we don\u0026rsquot know any other way.  However, the family still has hope that Noah\u0026rsquos miracle surgery will allow him to eat and drink normally in the future.  The life-saving operation took place at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Children on March 8 and involved metal rods being inserted to his tiny face to help secure the bones and allow him to breathe.  The surgery, called mandibular jaw distraction, saw doctors break his jaw in two places, with the rods being put in place to straighten his face and push his tongue forward.  It was so rare that surgeons had to send to Germany and the US for parts and consulted with other experts to decide if the operation was even possible.  It is hoped that the \u0026ldquoscaffolding will eventually move his jaw forward and help to reduce his chances of choking.  For three weeks after the surgery Miss Gordon and Mr Connell had to learn how to turn the screws in the metalwork \u0026ndash a process that has to be done with exact precision.  Jade, who cares full time for Noah, said: \u0026ldquoSince his surgery, his jaw has moved forward 4cm which should loosen up his airways.  \u0026ldquoThe surgery has worked as well as it can do just now and the movement in Noah\u0026rsquos jaw is a big improvement.  She added that both she and Mr Connell were shocked to learn that he could be the first person in the world to have the revolutionary surgery, but had no choice but to place their trust in the medical staff.  \u0026ldquoWe asked the doctors if we could see pictures from other surgeries like the one Noah was going to have, she said. \u0026ldquoBut they said they couldn\u0026rsquot.  \u0026ldquoWe couldn\u0026rsquot believe it when they said Noah would be the first baby in the world to have the operation.  \u0026ldquoIt was daunting to hear that but we trusted them.  Noah is now at home with his mother and father, who is a college student.  They say they are trying to \u0026ldquolive a normal life before the metal rods are taken out of his face next month."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7909504.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots give more than   1bn to charity in 2017 - but number of donors drops","story":"              SCOTS have given \u0026pound400 million\u0026nbspa year more to charity in 2017, even though there was a dip in the numbers feeling generous.  The latest report by the Charities Aid Foundation reveals that there has been a 50 per cent annual rise in donations to charity last year with the total given crashing through the \u0026pound1 billion barrier.  But the CAF said it was of \"some concern\" that there was a slight dip in the number of people giving money to charity year-on-year and that the rise is the result of the same number of people giving more, with the typical donation going up from \u0026pound36 in 2016 to \u0026pound60 in 2017.  It is believed the drop may be the result of a drop in trust in charities.  It comes as experts in the third sector earlier this year warned\u0026nbspin February that donations to Scottish charities could be damaged by the Oxfam sex scandal and public trust could be hit hard.  Oxfam workers in Haiti were accused of paying prostitutes and holding \u0026lsquoCaligula-style\u0026rsquo orgies, with participants allegedly including under-age girls, in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake there.  It was then\u0026nbspalso alleged that the charity knew about concerns over the behaviour of Oxfam\u0026rsquos country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, in a previous posting in Chad.    Figures released by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in February showed that trust in charities had dropped by nine per cent over the last two years.  The SCVO findings prompted the group to launch a new campaign called I Love Charity, amid evidence that donations were being hit.  The CAF\u0026rsquos Scotland Giving report says Scotsgave an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to charity in 2017, up from the\u0026nbsp\u0026pound813 million donated in 2016.  It also said that in 2017, 63 per cent of Scots questioned claimed to have donated money to charity compared to 65 per cent in 2016.  The CAF survey report said: \"This leads to a key policy question about how to encourage giving and whether it should focus on getting more people to give or getting those who give to give more, or indeed, a combination of both.\"  Anna Fowlie, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) said: \u0026ldquoThe findings from CAF\u0026rsquos report are fairly positive as they show that although the number of people giving has decreased, the amount of money being donated to charities in Scotland has gone up, which is great.  \"Figures released by SCVO in February 2018 showed that while trust in charities in Scotland is still high, it has dropped by nine per cent over the last two years, which may help explain why the number of people giving is down.    \"However our survey also showed that trust in local charities remains strong, particularly where people had personal experience of a charity, so it may be that the increase in giving is down to the impact of the good work organisations do in communities.  The Institute of Fundraising said the dip in donors may be because charities are focusing on giving \"existing supporters an even better experience\" instead of concentrating on attracting new supporters.  Alex Close, head of Scotland at the Institute of Fundraising, said \"We\u0026rsquore pleased to hear that the generosity of the Scottish public continues and it\u0026rsquos great to see a rise in the donation amounts that people in Scotland say that they have given.  \"The increase is likely to be caused by a combination of factors, rather than one single reason, including people feeling more financially secure, or a great experience with a charity that inspires them to increase their regular donation.    \"Many charities have been focusing even more on giving existing supporters a great donor experience and inspiring them to increase their regular donations. We hope that this generous trend continues and the Scottish public continue to give to good causes. \"  CAF found that Scotland accounts for 11.8 per cent of all UK charitable donations, despite representing 8.4 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos population.  It found that the most popular causes supported by those in Scotland were children and young people, with 28 per cent of those surveyed saying they had donated to this cause. This was followed by medical research (27 per cent) and animal welfare (25 per cent). The report also found that two in three (66 per cent) of people took part in a charitable or social activity, such as volunteering for a charity, donating money or goods, or buying an ethical product.  More than half (56 per cent) of those interviewed said they signed a petition in the previous 12 months, while 27 per cent had done so over the previous four weeks.  The report is based on a a survey of 1061 people in Scotland.    Sir John Low, Charities Aid Foundation chief executive said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see the total amount donated increasing across Scotland. Activism is also on the rise, perhaps re\u0026#64258ecting the turbulent times in which we live. This paints a picture of a thriving, vibrant society of which we should all be proud.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to take the work of our charities for granted \u0026ndash indeed CAF\u0026rsquos research over many years shows that millions of people benefit from their work without even realising it.

Developers say the \u0026pound55 million scheme, proposed for Netherplace reservoir in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, would be based on a \u0026ldquovision of active later living, and would be self-contained and come complete with medical services, leisure facilities and shops within its environs.  And they hope it could become the blueprint for other communities across Scotland if it is given approval when it goes before the local authority for assent later this week.  The Netherplace Retirement Development is the brainchild of property developer Shazad Bakhsh and is being taken forward by the Glasgow and Singapore-based property company Scotsbridge Holdings.  It would see the construction of 252 homes on the 17-acre former industrial site, made up of one and two-bedroom flats and cottages alongside a central \u0026ldquoclubhouse.  It would also incorporate a clinic and an 80-bed care home, as well as a fitness suite, spa, restaurant, community spaces and country walks.  Investments would be made in the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents.  Mr Bakhsh believes Netherplace could become one of the most innovative new communities for over-55s anywhere in the UK, and provide further inward investment to East Renfrewshire.  He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development, it will create a vibrant new community.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  Scotland is facing a demographic time bomb in the coming decades, with the number of pensioners expected to soar by almost 30 per cent in the next 25 years to 1.36 million by 2039, according to official figures from the Registers of Scotland.  Meanwhile, the number of over-75s is predicted to rise from 430,000 to about 800,000, while the working population paying taxes to meet the growing cost of public services is predicted to grow by just one per cent.  This will inevitably greatly impact on council budgets and the public purse, but Mr Bakhsh said that similar retirement communities help councils shoulder the burden by having services grouped together.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.  \u0026ldquoThe placement of these bespoke lifetime homes, with facilities which are second to none, will ensure a higher quality of living.  He added: \u0026ldquoOur professional and experienced team has a vision to modernise the sector and provide a development to both answer demand and exceed expectations.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  An independent economic impact study of the project estimates that the development will support more than 365 permanent jobs during the next 30 years, and contribute more than \u0026pound74m to the local economy .  It is also hoped that the purpose-built retirement community could help release much-needed housing stock elsewhere by allowing pensioners living in larger homes to downsize.  Netherplace reservoir, which dates back to 1850, will be incorporated into the overall design of the village and stocked with trout for fishing.  Demolition and clearance of the site, a former dye works which last operated in 2003, has already been completed to enable works to begin if planning permission is granted.  The development would be built across the road from Whitecraigs Rugby Club and immediately adjacent to the M77 motorway. A similar scheme was refused in 2015 amid objections from the community, social health and care partnership and Glasgow Airport.  Glasgow based practice Jewitt \u0026amp Wilkie Architects has been appointed to design the development. Founder Jonathan Jewitt said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove carried out thorough and extensive research on aspirational, high quality homes and engaged with numerous public and private bodies to achieve the optimum scheme proposal.  \u0026ldquoThis proposal includes a wide variety of unique features which have been subtly future-proofed to cater for the changing needs of residents.  \u0026ldquoIt is expected that housing currently occupied by one or two persons within the surrounding community will be released into the market for much-needed family housing."},{"url":null,"title":"Edinburgh wants to oust Sydney as best place to see in New Year","story":"              AS the first major city to welcome in the New Year, Sydney proudly boasts that it is hosts the most talked about party in the world.  But now organisers of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay event are gunning for the number one spot and hope to topple the Australian city from its perch.  The capital\u0026rsquos Hogmanay celebrations attracted 165,000 people last year, and had an economic impact of \u0026pound39 million, a new report states.  However, Underbelly, in its second year running the three-day event, wants Hogmanay to be the most talked about New Year celebration in the globe.  Around 10,000 more people, from 80 countries, attended the last Hogmanay event compared to 2017, and the organisers believe there still room for Edinburgh\u0026rsquos three-day New Year festival to grow.  Charlie Wood, director of Underbelly, said: \u0026ldquoOur plans aren\u0026rsquot about increasing that number of visitors, it is about increasing how Edinburgh and Scotland are viewed internationally.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about creating an event that is talked about, not just in the city, that notion of \u0026lsquoOh why wasn\u0026rsquot I there?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos the goal, its about creating those images and stories, that really sell the city and the country internationally.  Underbelly said its own research shows that Hogmanay generated 37 TV news pieces reaching 89 million viewers, 201 radio pieces reaching 141 million listeners, and more than 2,000 online articles reaching more than 10 billion readers, with 360 pieces in print. These figures helped lift Edinburgh from the 17th most covered New Year event in 2017 to joint 7th this year.  However, the short term aim, Mr Wood said, is to break into the top five, with a long term aim of being the most-visible New Year event in the globe.  The research shows the top New Year celebrations being covered internationally are Sydney at no 1, followed by Seoul and Hong Kong at joint 2nd, followed by New York, Singapore, and Paris, and then London and Edinburgh at joint seventh, followed by Tokyo, and Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Moscow at joint 10th.  Mr Wood added: \u0026ldquoIt cannot be an exact science, but it helps build a picture about how the world looks at Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoAnd our goal is to make sure that it beats every other city in the world as the city that everyone talks about - which is creatively we try to make it as different as possible.  \u0026ldquoThe aim is to get images and stories, about Hogmanay and about Scotland, all around the world.  The economic impact figure is 40 per cent higher than the last measurement, in 2010, of \u0026pound27.9m.  The last Hogmanay was the first staged by Underbelly for the City of Edinburgh Council, after being run by Peter Irvine\u0026rsquos Unique Events for more than 20 years.  Ed Bartlam, co-director, said: \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot set out to throw away what was already great about the event, we kept that, Peter Irvine did so much brilliant stuff, we just wanted to turn it up a notch, and that\u0026rsquos what we want to continue doing for the next few years.  Research conducted by BOP Consulting also surveyed 5,236 attendees and found that Hogmanay was the main or only reason for visiting Scotland for 71% of attendees from elsewhere in the world, 74% of whom were attending Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay for the first time.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay is principally funded by City of Edinburgh Council.  More than one-third of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay 2018 income came from public sector funding and 66% was from commercial sources of revenue including ticketing and sponsorship income.  Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted by the increased economic impact of the event on Edinburgh and Scotland to be an event that both encourages people to visit and creates employment in the city to have people from 80 countries buy tickets for the event but also see a strong local audience that engages and participates.  Ticket for Hogmanay 2019 are already on sale.  Councillor Donald Wilson, the culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council, said: \u0026ldquoUnderbelly certainly didn\u0026rsquot fail to impress in their first year producing the event and this report highlights just how much of a success the festival was with a whopping estimated economic impact of \u0026pound39.8m for Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"Minister resigns ahead of crunch Brexit votes","story":"              Theresa May has suffered a ministerial resignation ahead of crunch Commons votes on Brexit.  Remain-supporting Phillip Lee quit as justice minister, saying \"if Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well\" and it is \"irresponsible to proceed as we are\".  He said his main objection to Government policy was over the \"wish to limit Parliament\u0027s role in contributing to the final outcome\" - the so-called meaningful vote amendment.  His shock departure came as David Davis warned potential Tory rebels that they cannot undo the EU referendum, ahead of a tricky 48 hours in which the Government will try to get its Brexit programme back on track.  The Brexit Secretary spoke after some Conservatives signalled that they would support an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal Bill) tabled late on Monday by former attorney general Dominic Grieve giving more power to MPs.  The Commons begins two days of debate and votes on the Bill on Tuesday and Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment calls for a binding motion to be passed by the Commons, setting out how to proceed in the event of a \"no deal\" Brexit.  But Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum.  \"We will put in front of Parliament the decision for them to vote ... after that there will be a process of primary legislation to put the actual details of it in Parliament, so Parliament will actually decide on the application of the detail.\"  Asked what would happen if they voted against the deal, he said: \"If they throw it out, well, they throw it out. We will have to go away, think about it and come back and make a statement, which is what I am saying to the House this afternoon.\"  The Prime Minister appeared to have defused a potentially explosive row over the EU customs union on Monday night as Tory pro-Europe rebels Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bill Cash came together to table a separate compromise amendment backing \"a customs arrangement\" with the EU.  Government sources signalled to the Press Association that ministers were set to back the move. However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July.  Mrs May set the tone for a tense two days as she warned Tory Remainers that if they defied her and backed Lords amendments to the landmark Brexit legislation it would weaken Britain\u0027s hand at the negotiating table.  Addressing a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Monday, ahead of the key votes, she said: \"I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.  \"But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.\"  However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment.  Dismissing the Government\u0027s compromise, she tweeted: \"Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.  \"Grieve\u0027s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.\"  She said unless there was a \"meaningful vote\" Parliament would be left with \"the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all\".  It would also give hard Brexiteers the chance to \"scupper a good deal\", she claimed.  Sir Oliver defended his compromise agreement, saying it was \"sensible\" in delaying a vote on the customs plan until details were more settled.  Asked on Today if the amendment \"just kicked the can down the road\", he replied: \"That is a very sensible thing to do.  \"If you are engaged in trying to sort something which is complicated out, it makes sense to do it when you know what the thing that you are debating looks like.\"  Meanwhile, Ireland\u0027s premier raised the possibility of delaying Brexit to allow more time to negotiate the UK\u0027s exit deal.  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said extending the March 29 2019 departure date was one of a number of \"different scenarios\" that could be pursued if a withdrawal agreement fails to materialise in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Angus Grossart gives   1m to the revamp of the Burrell Collection","story":"              THE Scottish banker Sir Angus Grossart has given \u0026pound1m to the restoration of one of the nation\u0027s leading museums.

Bosses at LINK insisted they were doing \u0026ldquoeverything they possibly can to keep automated teller machines (ATMs) open in the communities where they are most needed.  But they admitted efforts to protect cash machines in remote areas would only be in place for four years and some could still close within that time.  LINK, the UK\u0026rsquos main cash machine network, is cutting the fee paid to operators from 25p to 20p per withdrawal over four years, but previously unveiled proposals to protect ATMs one kilometre or more from the next free machine.  It has led to worries that more than half of Scotland\u0027s 5,300 free-to-use ATMS could disappear.  However chairman Sir Mark Boleat admitted these measures would only plug the gap for the next few years, with \u0026ldquobigger issues looming if the number of people using ATMs continues to plummet.  He also appeared to predict widespread closures in cities, adding: \u0026ldquoThere are some city centres with 50 pay-to-use ATMs. We don\u0026rsquot think the public will be disadvantaged if that number falls to 40, or even to 30 or to 20.

And he insisted \u0026ldquofalling demand meant even protected ATMs could close in the next four years, despite a freeze on the fee paid to operators and additional financial incentives for machines in vulnerable areas.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf transactions fall by 40 per cent in the next 10 years, 30 or 40 per cent, there are bigger issues and we need to address those. Our own data shows consistently this year transactions have fallen by five per cent below last year.

Professor Griggs said work he had carried out suggested that while there was initially a \u0026ldquoheavy impact, communities moved on and found other ways of doing things.  He said: \"So I think it probably has a short-term effect but the evidence that I saw as I went around and visited probably 20 or 30 places across the whole of the UK looking at this, is that it settles down again and people go back to doing what they used to do but just in a different way and it\u0027s interesting they don\u0027t tend to move banks.\"  He said that during recent consultation meetings held with hundreds of people across the south of Scotland in connection with the new economic partnership, bank branch closures had been raised only once.

Popular folklore has it that the last wolf was shot by Sir Ewen Cameron in 1680 in Killiecrankie, Perthshire, in 1680 - long after they had been driven from the lowlands by deforestation.  But in recent years a loud debate has erupted over plans to bring back these top carnivores to the Highlands, and let them run free to prey on the deer herds.  Now scientists say that rewilding the wolf could be more than a pipe dream and that a sustainable population is a possibility, but only if it is kept fenced in.  Researchers from the University of Sussex and the University of Kent, concluded that 80 wolves spread over an area of 1,000 square miles - roughly 24,000 acres - would be required to \"reduce\" deer herds which have been blamed for over-grazing and preventing the return of woodland.    The Scottish Government estimates that there are around 375,000 red deer and 350,000 roe deer living in Scotland, and each year an annual cull has to be held to reduce their numbers.  Dr Christopher Sandom, lecturer in biology at the University of Sussex with a particular interest in rewilding, believes that wolves could be the answer to the problem, and that it is possible to ensure they do not cross paths with people using the land.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspShould wolves be reintroduced to Scotland?  The issue of reintroducing wolves to Scotland has proven controversial in the past, with farmers and landowners saying that they would go after sheep and could even pose a danger to hikers.  But the University study found that the idea was viable if an area was created where their paths would seldom cross with people\u0027s  Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoReintroducing the wolf has long been suggested as part of the solution to large deer populations but there will always be concerns about how wolves interact with people in any rewilding project like this.  \"This research shows that they could actually have an extremely beneficial impact in terms of making the rewilding process more effective.  The research, which also involved scientists from Aarhus University and the University of Oxford (WildCRU), tackled the question of how many wolves would be needed in an area to bring down the number of red deer to allow ecological restoration.  It used computer models to simulate wolves impact on the landscape, and drew on previous studies of areas were the animals had been re-introduced or were already living.    The team\u0026rsquos analyses found that a fence capable of retaining at least 75 per cent of dispersing wolves within the reserve would be optimum in allowing for rapid population growth that could lead to reduced deer numbers, without the risk of having so many predators that the red deer population would be threatened.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservation charity backs bringing back wild carnivores to Scotland\u0027s countryside.  However, it is unlikely any wolves leaving the area would get far if proper procedures were put in place.  In Finland, all wolves leaving an expanding wolf population into a reindeer management area were shot before being able to reproduce, while in the Bia\u0026#322owie\u0026#380a National Park in Poland, surrounding human activity has created a barrier to wolf movement patterns.  Biologists found that the wolf population of Riding Mountain National Park in Canada had limited interbreeding with other wolf populations in nearby protected areas and no successful wolf dispersal from the park had been recorded over several multi-year tracking studies over 40 years.    Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoFences are a common but unpopular tool in biodiversity conservation and would ideally be avoided. But where there are conflicting interests, compromise is needed.  \"Fences particularly constrain animal dispersal but as Britain is an island, this is less of a problem. A fenced reserve in Scotland could be a fantastic opportunity to return large predators to Britain, ecologically restore a large part of the Scottish Highlands, and promote tourism.  The researchers suggested that grey wolves, also known as timber wolves, would be the best candidates to be reintroduced in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  A previous experiment in Yellowstone national park in the US found that bringing back wolves to cull deer herds led to forests coming back and more biodiversity. It has since been hailed a major success story.

The idea of them returning will be thrilling for many people.  \u0026ldquoWhile our model offers insights into what is likely to happen, the crucial next step would be to test these ideas in practice \u0026ndash by creating a reserve, reintroducing wolves, and closely monitoring the system.\u0026nbsp  \"More generally and perhaps counterintuitively, barriers in some form might have a more important role to play in establishing modern wild areas than previously thought\".

So far our results are just simulations made from the safety of a desk, but they offer a highly original way of thinking about restoring nature and natural processes."},{"url":null,"title":"Pupils from armed forces families    less likely    to go to university","story":"              PUPILS whose families serve in the armed forces are less likely to go to university because of the significant disruption they face at school, campaigners have warned.  A new survey found one in four Scottish pupils from a services background attended at least seven schools as a result of parents being posted to different locations across the UK and beyond.  In one extreme case a pupil had been to 27 different schools between starting nursery and leaving secondary.  As a result of the disruption some 70 per cent said they lacked confidence, 71 per cent had experienced anxiety and 60 per cent said they had found studying difficult.  In addition, one in five said they had experienced difficulties with friendships and 44 per cent said they had felt isolated.  The Royal Caledonian Education Trust (RCET), a 200-year-old charity for armed forces children, said pupils from a military background were one third less likely to go to university than their civilian peers.  Moira Leslie, education manager at RCET, said children from such backgrounds should be considered alongside other groups who face disadvantages when they apply to higher education.  Currently, universities give preferential treatment to pupils from the poorest backgrounds to recognise the impact of poverty on attainment.  Mrs Leslie said: \u0026ldquoNot everyone is affected, but as our survey shows there can be significant disruption to the education of pupils from armed forces families, she said.  \u0026ldquoPupils in this situation can find it difficult to study, particularly if a parent or parents are serving in an active situation or because they are absent.  \u0026ldquoIf pupils have moved between schools they can find it difficult to settle in a new environment and there may be differences in the coursework or teaching they experience.  \u0026ldquoWhere they can also find it difficult is when they have an established group of friends that they have to leave behind and start all over again.  Mrs Leslie said RCET was concerned pupils who would potentially thrive at university were being denied the opportunity.  \u0026ldquoBecause of these experiences they should be encouraged and supported to include that in personal statements when they apply to university.  \u0026ldquoThere should also be a way for universities to identify these applications so they can make allowances.  Five years ago a study of Scottish children who had parents serving in Afghanistan found their levels of stress were particularly high in the build up to their deployment with their worst fears being that their father or mother would be injured or killed.  Academics from City University London, who interviewed more than 50 Scottish pupils, also found they felt apprehensive when their parents were away from home and had difficulty sleeping. Children between the ages of eight and 11 were particularly affected.  The issue was discussed at the Scotland\u0026rsquos Fair Access Conference in Perth, organised by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).  The event focused on the mental health and wellbeing of college and university students.  A key theme was how to improve support for the increasing number of students with caring responsibilities.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the Higher Education Secretary, said every student should have an equal chance to fulfil their potential.  \u0026ldquoAs well as supporting access to courses, it is essential colleges and universities provide appropriate support for students\u0026rsquo health and wellbeing, she said.  Luke Humberstone, president of student body NUS Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe need to see institutions acknowledging and tackling the barriers that prospective students can face.  Mike Cantlay, chairman of the SFC, said: \u0026ldquoThis important national event will be a catalyst for better understanding and faster progress."},{"url":null,"title":"Councils urged to change their tune on school music fees","story":"              MUSICIANS have held a demonstration in Glasgow\u0026rsquos George Square to protest over cuts to free tuition in schools across the country.  The impromptu orchestra of professional musicians and students played a funeral march to highlight the ongoing battle to stop councils cutting or charging for tuition.  The protest was also held to publicise a Scottish Parliament petition on the issue which has attracted more than 6,500 signatures.  Eleven local authorities across Scotland have increased their music tuition rates in recent times with some families expected to pay more than \u0026pound500 a year.  East Lothian Council has become the latest to introduce charges with parents now facing annual fees of \u0026pound280. Glasgow does not charge families.  The increasing fees have promoted campaigners to warn that music tuition in schools will become the preserve of the well off in future.  John Wallace, chairman of the Music Education Partnership Group, who conducted the orchestra, said there would be a significant impact on the whole of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe are here to highlight the fact that Scottish state schools have a world class system.  \u0026ldquoThere is a great deal of support for the petition from professional musicians because this is the route that we all took and if it slides back any more then we all fear for the future.  \u0026ldquoThis is something that Scotland currently does very well and we have evidence in schools across the land with pupil orchestras, but if we continue down the path of cuts and charges then they become very difficult to run.

As consolation for the loss of EU citizenship and the Sewel Convention he\u0026rsquos backing plans for a \u0026ldquoBrexit stability bridge between Portpatrick and Larne in Northern Ireland. One hopes that this is not just to make it easier for the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, to pop across for the odd Orange march.  But we needn\u0026rsquot worry, because Boris is the kiss of death to bridge projects. As London Mayor, he presided over the ill-fated Garden Bridge, which had to be abandoned after spending \u0026pound46 million in fees. He also proposed a 22- mile bridge over the English Channel. This new Brexit bridge is about as likely to happen as Britain getting friction-free access to the European Single Market.  Two years after the referendum and we\u0026rsquore no nearer finding out what Brexit actually means, though just about everyone agrees it will be a disaster. There is a Commons majority in favour of halting this act of national self-harm by giving Westminster the power to seize the reins from Theresa May. But shell-shocked Tory MPs were persuaded yesterday (after \u0026ldquomeaningful concessions that are largely meaningless) that if they didn\u0026rsquot support the PM, Boris would likely replace her, and probably declare war on France. Well, he\u0026rsquos said he wants to emulate Donald Trump\u0026rsquos style of diplomacy.  Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos crew are at sixes and sevens over whether or not to join EFTA/EEA/Customs Union/Single Market/all of the above. Her Majesty\u0026rsquos Opposition will collapse in a heap today in the remaining Commons votes on the Lords amendments. It is surely a first for Britain to have both Government and Opposition utterly clueless about what to do about a major national crisis. The only people who seem to know what they want are in Brussels \u0026ndash maybe we should just hand Brexit over to them.  In a sense, this is happening by default. After this week, Theresa May will press ahead with her proposal for a customs union in all but name \u0026ndash a proposal which Brussels has already rejected as unacceptable to the EU 27. She will also push her \u0026ldquomax fac solution to the Irish Border issue, which is to pretend that there isn\u0026rsquot a border at all. This has also been rejected by Brussels. Michel Barnier has said all along that there can be no \u0026ldquocherry picking of the European Single Market, and that the UK has already agreed that Northern Ireland will remain in regulatory alignment with it. The Boris bridge is partly about halting what he sees as this dastardly EU plan to break up Britain.  But his own Government is doing a very good job of that already. Yesterday it rammed through the objectionable clauses of the EU Withdrawal Bill which effectively abolish Scottish devolution for the next seven years. In that time, Mrs May will have complete power to override Holyrood over important matters like agriculture, food safety, environment and so on. Not only did she brush aside the SNP\u0026rsquos and Labour amendments, the Government didn\u0026rsquot even bother to honour its own promise to come up with an amendment of its own. Not so much a power grab as a smash-and-grab.  So, you\u0026rsquoll have had your devolution. Anyone who believes that, after seven years, normal devolutionary service will resume needs to think again. The UK Government will clearly not allow the Scottish Parliament to reverse any or all of the changes made in the \u0026ldquotransition period, since these are deemed crucial for the functioning of the new, post-Brexit UK internal market. They are for keeps. Moreover, the precedent will be established that Westminster can now over-ride any and all of Scotland\u0026rsquos devolved responsibilities whenever it considers it necessary \u0026ndash which is pretty much all the time. Home rule is over. If Mrs May was trying to make the case for an independent Scotland, she could hardly have done better.  It\u0026rsquos not quite the end of the matter, because the Supreme Court has to rule on the legitimacy of the Continuity Bill passed by Holyrood earlier this year. This is intended to counter the UK Withdrawal Bill by replicating it: by asserting that the repatriated powers continue to reside at Holyrood. Then there is the Legislative Consent Motion which Holyrood has refused to agree for the EU Withdrawal Bill \u0026ndash the first time this has happened since 1999. But the Government clearly hopes to deal with this in the same brusque manner as the Clause 11/15 issue: just bash it through Parliament on a busy news day and hope no one notices. Well, it\u0026rsquos just the Scots, after all, and they\u0026rsquore always causing trouble about something.  And so Scotland is dragged kicking and screaming out of the European Union as part of a new unitary British state in which devolution in the manner of the 1998 Scotland Act has effectively been abolished. Scots will lose their citizenship rights in the EU and the protections that go along with it as well as \u0026ldquothe most powerful devolved parliament in the world. We\u0026rsquoll be out of the single market, and the customs union while Northern Ireland will remain largely within it.  According to Philip Lee, the Tory minister who resigned yesterday over Brexit, the choice for Britain is between \u0026ldquoa bad deal and a cliff edge. That is no choice. There must be a better way. I\u0026rsquove argued against holding a second EU referendum unless public opinion swings dramatically against Brexit. But I\u0026rsquom not sure we can afford to wait much longer, while this hapless Prime Minister, bereft of any plan, damages the national interest.  The obvious course for the UK is to rejoin EFTA, which we founded in 1960 as a rival to the EEC, and then align with the European Economic Area with Norway. This means leaving the European Union but remaining in the single market. This eminently sensible solution is being rejected by a weak Prime Minister at the mercy of a cabal of right-wing Tory revolutionaries bent on Making Britain Great Again. They must be stopped. The only way is to give voters the chance to consign Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos cliff-edge Brexit to the dumpster of his other bright ideas."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP MSP accused of  unreliable  evidence in defamation race case","story":"              COURT evidence given by an SNP MSP under oath has been labelled \u0026ldquounreliable, self-serving and evasive in the closing submission of a \u0026pound100,000 defamation case.

In reply, Roddy Dunlop QC, for Ms McCulloch, accused Ms McAnulty of being heedless of racial sensitivities, and accused her and her key witness of lying in court.  Ms McAnulty is suing Ms McCulloch for alleging she used the word \u0026ldquoPakis in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car in 2015 and saying she wanted Asian members out the local SNP.

She initially said the conversation was in late May 2015, but it later emerged she and Ms McAnulty were in her car on 20 June.  Steven Bonnar, a current SNP councillor in North Lanarkshire, testified he was in the car on that date with the two women, and heard no racist remarks being made.  After four days of evidence in April, the case resumed - and concluded - yesterday.  The court previously heard Ms McAnulty and Ms McCulloch were on rival sides of a \u0026ldquotoxic turf war within the local SNP, with two camps vying for dominance.  Ms McAnulty was allied to former Coatbridge MP Phil Boswell, who wanted reform, while Ms McCulloch was allied to Mr Lyle, whose group wanted to maintain their grip on power.

A Daily Record story three days later led to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos suspension by the SNP.  In his submission to Lord Uist, Mr McBrearty said Mr Lyle, who was not present in court, had been a \u0026ldquobit part player.  However he criticised his evidence, including his attempt to \u0026ldquodissociate himself from the feuding, and his claim he knew nothing about the racism complaint for three days, despite his childhood friend and employee sending it from his office.  He said it was \u0026ldquocompletely implausible that Mr Lyle, who previously denied any \u0026ldquoinput to the complaint or giving misleading evidence, had been unaware of it until it appeared in the Record.  Mr McBrearty said the email was part of a targeted campaign against Ms McAnulty that including two other damaging Daily Record stories about her and race in previous weeks.  He said Ms McCulloch could not credibly explain why she emailed 13 people, only three of whom dealt with party discipline, nor explain why she waited until February.

Calling his evidence \u0026ldquostraight-forward and compelling, he asked: \u0026ldquoWhy would Mr Bonnar risk everything in giving evidence in support of someone who has made racist statements?  He said it was very difficult to think Mr Bonnar could be mistaken about being in the car, not least because the day in question was the launch of his successful by-election campaign.  However he said some of Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos witnesses, who said Mr Bonnar may have been in a different car, were understandably mistaken in recalling small events from 2015.  Summing up, he invited Lord Uist to find Ms McAnulty did not make the remark attributed to her, and that Ms McCulloch knew the allegation to be untruthful.

He suggested compensatory damages be set at \u0026pound100,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch intended the complaint to leak to the press, or would have expected it to leak, causing Ms McAnulty greater damage and upset, or at around \u0026pound40,000 otherwise.  In his submission, Mr Dunlop attacked Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos evidence, saying problems with in it cast doubt on her whole case.  He said that at an SNP meeting in 2012 she was \u0026ldquoheedless of racial sensitivities by questioning whether a senior Asian member, Dr Imtiaz Majid, later an SNP councillor, directed the votes of other Asian members.  He said Ms McAnulty was also prepared to \u0026ldquosully the reputation of other witnesses by accusing them of perjury, fabrication and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Critics branded the findings \"outrageous\", and accused the SNP of meddling in the FoI process to \"stop bad news happening\".

In a letter to Mr Mundell, committee convener Bruce Crawford invited him to appear at Holyrood \u0026ldquoas a matter of urgency.  However a Whitehall source said that, although Mr Mundell was willing to appear, it may not before the summer recess, meaning September at the earliest.  It follows Westminster agreeing a controversial \u0026ldquopower grab in the EU Withdrawal Bill, which a majority MSPs refused to endorse in May because it undermined devolution.  The Bill means 24 devolved policy areas being repatriated from Brussels at Brexit will be reserved at Westminster for up to seven years, rather than lying at Holyrood.  The UK Government says the measure is necessary to create UK-wide common frameworks to protect the UK single market through harmonised regulations.  However the Scottish Government has said such frameworks must be agreed by \u0026ldquoconsent, not imposed, something the UK Government has rejected as a veto power.

In response, Mr Mundell said the debate time was \u0026ldquounfortunate, but blamed the Labour Party for pursuing numerous unwinnable votes.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt would have been possible to have had much, much more time to debate the issues in question.  \u0026ldquoDavid Lidington took numerous interventions through his period. What would have been much much better would have been to have longer to have had the debate.  \u0026ldquoThe way of achieving that was for Labour not to pursue everything to a vote.  When it was pointed out the parliamentary timetable was set by the Government, not the opposition, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquopeople knew exactly how much time was available.  \u0026ldquoThe Labour Party knew exactly how much time there would be left to debate these issues if they took every single vote, which is what they did, and I think that\u0026rsquos very regrettable.  \u0026ldquoEven if we had had 100 hours of debate the outcome wouldn\u0026rsquot have changed because the SNP and Scottish Government position is exactly the same as it was on day one of this Bill.  Asked to characterise his handling of the matter, including an absence of previously promised amendments, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now quite clear that it was never going to be possible to get agreed amendments because Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have a different view of devolution from everyone else.

The Conservatives, he later suggested, had returned to the days of Margaret Thatcher and were acting in an \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish way.  In developments that stunned MPs during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, the Nationalist leader attacked the Conservative Government, which he said was implementing, through its legislation, a power-grab against Holyrood and had not even given Scottish MPs the chance to debate it during Tuesday\u0026rsquos consideration of the Bill.  Using a rare parliamentary device, he called for a \u0026ldquoprivate sitting of Parliament, which would have removed the public from the chamber\u0026rsquos gallery.  The move appeared to take John Bercow, the Speaker, Theresa May, and others totally by surprise.  As the chamber descended into confusion, Mr Bercow hurriedly consulted the Commons lawyers and suggested a vote on Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos request be taken after PMQs. But the Highland MP insisted he wanted an immediate vote, declaring: \u0026ldquoI beg to move.  At which point as Nationalist MPs cheered, Opposition MPs jeered. The Speaker took more advice, repeating that the vote should take place at the end of PMQs. \u0026ldquoThat is the end of the matter, declared Mr Bercow, calling the PM to respond.  But Mr Blackford continued to stand as the Speaker urged him amid the roar of the chamber to sit down, insisting: \u0026ldquoNo, you\u0026rsquore not moving anything.  As the volume in the chamber rose further on all sides, Labour frontbenchers were engaged in hurried private conversations.  As the Speaker again insisted a vote could take place at the end of PMQs, SNP backbencher David Linden shouted: \u0026ldquoNow!

I\u0026rsquom telling you there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now.  As Mr Blackford rose again to applause from some of his SNP colleagues, the Speaker shouted: \u0026ldquoOrder. Resume your seat Mr Blackford! He then said in light of the party leader\u0026rsquos refusal to resume his seat, he ordered him to leave the chamber immediately.  At first, the Highland MP did not go. As MPs continued to shout, Mr Bercow could he heard saying to colleagues: \u0026ldquoHe won\u0026rsquot, so we\u0026rsquoll have to have the vote.  At one point, Joanna Cherry, the Nationalist MP, could be seen shouting at the Tory benches before Mr Blackford dramatically walked out followed by his SNP colleagues. Ms Cherry as she left waved to the Speaker, saying: \u0026ldquoGoodbye.  As the noise level began to subside, Mr Bercow said it was a pity as Nationalist MPs had questions down on the Order Paper.  Earlier, in Commons exchanges, the SNP leader had pointed out that despite the declaration that Scotland would be a partner of equals in the UK, the Tory Government had pressed ahead with a \u0026ldquopower-grab in direct opposition to Scotland\u0026rsquos Parliament and had \u0026ldquosilenced Scotland\u0026rsquos voice.

He called on her to bring forward emergency legislation so that the \u0026ldquowill of the Scottish Parliament can be heard and, more importantly be respected.  Mrs May stressed how the outcome of the Brexit process would increase Holyrood\u0026rsquos powers in 80 areas, declaring: \u0026ldquoIt is not the case that this is in any way a power-grab. She went on: \u0026ldquoOnly the SNP could say that getting 80 more areas where they are going to take decisions was a power-grab.  Pointing to how there was just 15 minutes on Tuesday night for debate on the Scottish clause to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the PM blamed Labour for using \u0026ldquoprocedural manoeuvres in calling unnecessary votes.  Mr Blackford replied that the reality was powers enshrined under the 1998 Scotland Act were being \u0026ldquograbbed back by Whitehall and Scottish MPs were \u0026ldquonot given the courtesy of even debating it last night it\u0026rsquos a democratic outrage. The people of Scotland will not be disrespected by this Parliament.  Outside the chamber, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not prepared to stand back and see Westminster engage in a power-grab against the Scottish Parliament and to do so on a basis that Scotland\u0026rsquos parliamentarians have not been given the opportunity to debate what this Parliament is doing. It\u0026rsquos an outrage.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe are going to make sure we will be robust in using parliamentary devices to make sure we can hold this Government to account. We are in a situation that the Westminster Government has shown utter disrespect to the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland by wilfully ignoring that the fact that the Scottish Parliament has refused to give a consent motion.  \u0026ldquoThey are now acting outwith the support of the Scottish people. The Conservatives have returned to where they were before in acting in a manner that is anti-Scottish. We are not having it.  But Scottish Conservative MP Kirstene Hair decried the SNP\u0026rsquos actions.  \"This rehearsed move just demonstrated that the SNP care more about headlines than actually achieving anything for Scotland.  \"They are the masters of manufactured grievance and the people of Scotland are sick of it.  \"The SNP have played games with the constitution, played games with Brexit and now are playing games with Parliament. It is a joke, added the Angus MP.  Meanwhile in the chamber, Mr Bercow at the end of PMqs looked up and praised a baby in the public gallery, who, he said, had been \"a model of impeccable behaviour\" despite the \"turbulence\" of the proceedings."},{"url":null,"title":"animal welfare charity welcomes new addition","story":"\t\tA foal has been born at the Scottish SPCA\u0027s Aberdeen Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre.\t\t\t\tScotland’s animal welfare charity welcomed the healthy colt into the world at 7.30am yesterday (Tuesday, June 12).
