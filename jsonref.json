More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland

times, there is a shocking poverty gap when it comes to how our children do at school. By the time they arrive for their very first day, disadvantaged kids are already four months’ learning behind their more privileged peers. Yet these are not normal times. Two years of Covid shutdowns have led to educational consequences that grimly rival those of a deprived upbringing – but for all.After the first lockdown, for example, the latest data suggests average primary school pupils were 3.6 months adrift of the level in maths that pre-pandemic years had achieved at the same stage. Children in some parts of the country fared far worse. In Yorkshire and the Humber, the gap was 5.7 months. When it came to reading, primary children unlucky enough to find themselves in the Covid cohort were on average just under two months behind. The question now for teachers, parents and the Government is whether they will ever catch up, or whether the years of disruption they have encountered today will cascade through the rest of their lives, impacting university and career prospects and their personal lives, too. It was never meant to be like this. But temporary emergency measures have morphed into a two-year trial, with repeated lockdowns, homeschooling, and the pingdemic puncturing entire class bubbles. Still, it goes on.In January, almost one in 12 teachers was off work. Last week, MPs declared the Government’s £5 billion National Tutoring Programme to help disadvantaged children “level up” after Covid to be a costly failure. Meanwhile, according to the Centre for Social Justice, 100,000 “ghost children” – those who miss more than half their school sessions – have almost entirely disappeared from education since last year’s return to schools.Making good will not be easy. Deprived children may start school only four months behind, but generally they don’t catch up. According to Natalie Perera, CEO of the Education Policy Institute (EPI), by the time they leave education, the gap has widened to 18 months. So will Britain’s Covid cohort suffer a similar fate?The stakes for them, and the nation, could hardly be higher. Work by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that every extra year of schooling adds eight per cent to lifetime earnings. Other studies put the figure even higher, between 10 and 15 per cent. Using these estimates, the EPI has calculated that Britain’s Covid cohort is likely to lose between £15,604 and £30,881 each over their careers. Pessimistic scenarios put the loss as high as £46,321 per child – adding up to £463 billion for all affected children in England. The World Bank calculates that, globally, such Covid-inflicted salary losses could add up to an astonishing $10 trillion (£7.6 trillion).Nor are the impacts on children purely academic, or their consequences solely financial. Repeated lockdowns are likely to take a significant toll on young people’s physical health given that, in 2019, a study suggested that people were 6.85 per cent less likely to report poor health in later life for one additional year of schooling.Meanwhile, surveyed by the charity Young Minds, two-thirds of children said they expected repeated lockdowns to leave long-term scars on their mental health. This is borne out by teachers who have seen children regress, not just in their studies, but in their social behaviour. Suddenly, the function of classrooms not just as places of learning, but of pastoral care, has become all too evident.Many places saw a rise in children referred to social services. In Middlesbrough, the number rose by 40 per cent year on year. As Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s Chief Inspector, wrote in her recent annual report: “This was a difficult year to be young, and a challenging time to be learning. In all phases of education in 202021, most children and young people have learned less than they normally would have done. For many, the loss of education, disrupted routine and lack of physical and other activities led to physical and mental health problems. Loneliness, boredom and misery became endemic among the young.”After a wide-ranging survey, the Children’s Commissioner compiled some heartbreaking tales. One 10-year-old boy confessed: “My reading and spelling is not very good. All the words get muddled up and I need more help in class, but I can’t always have it.” A nine-year-old girl added: “Lockdown really stops children, because they can’t do that much stuff we love and it makes them go all shaky.”Some children will never have known anything else: six-year-olds now in Year 2 might be forgiven for forgetting the brief spell of normality they enjoyed after joining Reception in September 2019. By the following March, their educational landscape was blasted by the first lockdown their Year 1 was shattered by its successor in spring 2021. Headteachers are faced with pupils far behind usual developmental milestones: five- and six-year-olds in nappies isolated four- and five-year-olds, shorn of pre-school playdates, group childcare, contact with grandparents, and confronted by a world wearing masks, arriving on their first day with few words to express themselves, and boiling with frustration in consequence. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) found that more than three quarters of primary schools said pupils starting school in September 2020 needed more support with communication than in previous years. Isolated in the pandemic, with fewer opportunities for play, toddlers tested in the past two years for language, puzzle-solving and motor skills are far behind those tested last decade. “Things just began sort of falling off a rock,” said one scientist studying infant cognition.The damage may even be starting in the womb. The journal Nature recently reported on research suggesting that “pandemic-related stress during pregnancy could be negatively affecting foetal brain development”.Despite all this, there is cause for hope. Children – particularly young children – are rubbery creatures, with “bounceback-ability”. Researchers are confident that slow-starting toddlers can catch up. And at primary school age, too, the data shows that children released from lockdowns have pegged back some of their losses. By the end of last academic year, the average lag in maths had fallen from the 3.6 months of autumn 2020, to 2.2 months. Yorkshire and the Humber, which had fallen almost half a year behind, had recovered 3.8 months. Recovery is possible. Indeed, children have been shown to bounce back before, as they did after rural communities and schooling were hit (though much less severely) by the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001. They can overcome social barriers, too. In 1975, the psychologist Edward Tronick conducted the famous “Still Face” experiment which showed how toddlers of parents instructed to remain expressionless first courted their attention, then turned inward and withdrew. Repeating the experiment almost half a century later, this time with facemasks, did not produce the same results. The children were able to feed off other cues to communicate and bond. Older children, however, struggle more to recover. Secondary school children, who quickly fell behind an average of 1.5 months in reading after the first lockdown, have barely made up any lost ground after returning to class. It is tempting to tell parents that this is no problem – that all children are facing the same challenges and suffering the same setbacks. Yet study after study suggests this is not true. The gap between those who were homeschooled by well-educated, WFH parents with plenty of time, money and laptops and those who weren’t is growing wider and wider. Teachers struggle to  the ever-widening spectrum of ability they see in a single class. Those with funds flee to private schools, only entrenching inequality. The EPI is calling for a host of targeted measures – better early-years teachers, one-to-one tuition for struggling children, and afterschool activities rather than an extension of the school day, which might involve catch-up lessons but could simply be about socialising and sports.But it will take money. Total funding for education recovery in England now stands at £4.9 billion, or around £490 per pupil. That is considerably less than the Netherlands, say, where the figure is £2,100 per pupil. To truly make up for lost ground, the EPI suggests the Government will need to splash out another £8.6 billion.It is a sliding doors moment, with a generation’s education at stake. The consequences a bad start at school can have are clear: doing less well in exams, dropping out earlier, earning less, getting sicker and dying younger. “The pandemic has and will have a very considerable impact,” says Perera. “Time out of school has a long-term impact on employment outcomes as well as social and emotional health. We can’t say that they’ll never catch up, but what we do want is for the Government to acknowledge this and to provide more funding. The last thing we want to do is write this generation off.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia kills 35 in attack on military base used by foreign soldiersSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russia ‘installs new mayor in Melitopol’Avoid sequins and don\u0026#39t throw away wine-stained outfits, Bafta tells starsHong Kong\u0026#39s freedom of press is nearing the \u0026#39end of the line\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dozens universities ignore easing covid mask rules","story":"Universities should not force students to wear masks as they have sacrificed enough, a minister has said as eleven Russell Group institutions keep rules in place. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, joined the student watchdog in rebuking vice-chancellors who are still imposing curbs despite England’s last remaining restrictions being ditched.Guidance from the Department for Education says that face coverings are no longer advised for students, staff and visitors in teaching settings or communal areas. But an analysis has found eleven of the 24 leading Russell Group universities - and a total of 51 universities across the country - are going beyond DfE guidance despite last month\u0027s rule relaxation.Just 21 of the 117 universities surveyed had mask policies in line with the DfE, sparking fury from parents and students, while the others were unclear or out of date.\u0027A sign of respect, kindness and sensitivity\u0027The University of Bristol is still telling all staff and students they are required to wear a face covering inside buildings on campus, including teaching spaces, corridors, libraries, reading rooms and study spaces, though residences are exempt. It describes masks as a sign of respect, kindness, and sensitivity to each other.Meanwhile, London School of Economics guidance says masks are still mandatory in lifts and for students in all teaching rooms. UCL also expects masks in teaching areas, as does the University of Leeds when staff ask for them. Oxford University’s guidance says: Departments, as well as inidual members of teaching staff, can continue to mandate face coverings in teaching and learning environments (unless iniduals are exempt). Face coverings are strongly encouraged in libraries and should be worn when moving around university buildings.Responding to the findings, Ms Donelan told The : I do not believe universities should be going beyond our guidance by imposing additional, mandatory, restrictions on students. Young people have already sacrificed enough during this pandemic and students should be able to enjoy the full university experience they deserve.\u0027It is right that students expect a much more normal university experience\u0027  Lord Wharton, chairman of the Office for Students watchdog added: There are no legal restrictions around mask wearing in higher education, and most universities are steadily returning to normal. It is right that students now expect a much more normal university experience, with in-person teaching and socialising, as well as the opportunity for prospective students to go to campuses to visit universities they are considering.Imperial College London still encourages face coverings in teaching areas and whilst moving around in examinations but not when seated.Others including King’s College London and the universities of Exeter, Durham, Manchester and York are urging or strongly urging, but not mandating, masks on parts of campus. Some universities are still only holding virtual open days, and ask students and visitors to take lateral flow tests, despite free tests winding up.\u0027Stasi-like environment\u0027Arabella Skinner, of the parents group Us For Them UK which conducted the survey, warned of a Stasi-like environment where students police their maskless peers and said parents of sixth formers were avoiding such universities or taking gap years.Jude D’Alesio, 21, a final-year Bristol law student, felt the university\u0027s mask mandate was coming at the expense of student participation in seminars - not only is it far harder to hear other students\u0027 answers, but group work is far more constricted and less free-flowing when you cannot gauge people\u0027s reactions. A Bristol University spokesman said its mask rule was reviewed on a fortnightly basis and any changes will be made following careful consideration of the situation with expert advice from our scientists and partners. A Russell Group spokesman said: Universities make decisions on campus requirements at a local level, based on the interests of their staff and student communities. While face coverings are no longer required in the vast majority of settings, universities may continue to encourage their use in busy indoor areas, such as lifts or small crowded places, for personal protection as well as out of respect for others, in the same way as public transport providers and major retailers do.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia kills 35 in attack on military base used by foreign soldiersSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russia ‘installs new mayor in Melitopol’Avoid sequins and don\u0026#39t throw away wine-stained outfits, Bafta tells starsHong Kong\u0026#39s freedom of press is nearing the \u0026#39end of the line\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"heroic people poland know true value freedom nationhood","story":"On Thursday, MEPs voted by 478 to 155 to apply economic sanctions. Not against Russia this time, but against two of their own member states: Poland and Hungary. Brussels accuses both countries of violating basic European values, and wants to trigger a mechanism whereby they must continue to pay into the EU budget but cannot claim funds from it – effectively an open-ended fine.The timing was unfortunate. Poland has received the largest number of Ukrainian refugees, Hungary the second-largest. They are in the front line in protecting what are surely the most elemental European values of all, upholding democratic pluralism in the face of an aggressive war waged by a tyrant.I happened to hear the news of the European Parliament’s vote while in Tomaszów Lubelski, a small town on the Polish-Ukrainian border, where I was watching, awe-struck, as local people got on unfussily with meeting the refugee crisis.It is hard to convey the extent to which Poles have mobilised to help their stricken neighbours. Public and private buildings are draped with the Ukrainian flag, whose cheerful colours illuminate local landmarks at night. Every business is doing its bit. Newspapers are printing Ukrainian-language issues for the new arrivals, phone companies are offering free data, hotels free beds. The rental cars at Krakow airport were thin on the ground because so many volunteers were driving women and children from the border. “You can bring as many people back as you are able to fit,” said the lady at the desk earnestly. “It’s a four-hour drive from here.”Poles recently celebrated the centenary of the Polish-Soviet War, a campaign little known in the West, but keenly remembered here as a moment when a citizen militia saved European civilisation, turning back the Red Army from the gates of Warsaw. Now, once again, they are shouldering their burden again, largely unthanked by their Western neighbours.Every survey of public opinion – every poll of Poles, so to speak – shows that over 90 per cent of respondents back giving unrestricted access to Ukrainians, and that around two thirds want to assist themselves. I am suspicious of polls that ask people in the abstract whether they’re ready to help, but the evidence on the ground – what economists would call the revealed preferences – suggest that most Poles are doing their bit. Fleets of private cars, vans and buses are ferrying refugees, first from the border to reception centres, and then from these centres to wherever they have friends or relatives. Mayors in frontier towns are handing out supplies in converted school gyms. Airbnb accommodation is offered free of charge, spare rooms are advertised.This is open-source aid. Alongside the Poles are volunteers from every country, arriving with aid and leaving with people. On my first day at the border, I happened across a Gloucestershire county councillor who, with a small team, had delivered two lorryloads and four vanloads of assistance, and was planning to return the following week with vehicles wanted in Western Ukraine. No government department could manage an operation on such a scale. No state agency could receive, accommodate and transport people in the way these iniduals and charities are doing.For what it’s worth, few of the refugees I spoke to planned to come to the UK. Some wanted to go to countries where they had friends or relatives but most intended to remain in Poland. They had left husbands and sons in Ukraine, and wanted to stay as close to home as possible. The border states – Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Romania – have absorbed 90 per cent of the refugees. Poland alone has taken five times as many as all non-frontline EU countries put together.That said, our Home Office has again shown itself to be monumentally useless. Inert and inept in the face of the Channel crossings, it is also incapable of unlocking the door when there is a bona fide refugee crisis. Unable to keep people out, it is also unable to let people in.It is worth taking a moment to deal with the accusation, often levelled in Brussels, that Poland (and Hungary) are pursuing racist immigration policies, showing a generosity to Ukrainians that they did not show to Syrians or Afghans. No doubt there are some racists in both places. But the most obvious difference between this wave of migration and the earlier ones is that these arrivals are almost all women and children.In the summer of 2015, I worked in a hostel for migrants who had crossed the Mediterranean in rafts. Nineteen out of every 20 people I saw descending the gangplanks of the Italian rescue boats were young men. I say this in no carping spirit. They were bold, resourceful, ambitious boys who were doing exactly what I hope I’d do in their situation. But they were not refugees, at least not as we define that word legally. They were, in most cases, fleeing poverty and corruption rather than war or persecution.That distinction ought to be obvious, but we are in a cultural moment when some commentators insist on seeing everything as evidence of racism, even Prince William’s innocuous remark, not helped by the fact that it was misreported, that people of his generation were shocked to see war in Europe. Poland has not yet been touched by the Great Awokening, and finds such criticism bewildering. British academics might see everything through imagined hierarchies of oppression. They might debate whether gender is a social construct. But Poles see a difference between men who have left their families behind and families who have left their men behind.It was such conservative attitudes that landed Poland in the dock in Brussels in the first place. Eurocrats see the current government as altogether too Catholic and, worst of all, nationalist. Its real sin was to declare that Polish national law was supreme over EU law – or, at least, that its own judges, rather than the EU’s, should get to decide when Brussels is going beyond the powers bestowed on it by the EU treaties.Nationalism is the worst of all offences in Brussels, the sin against the Holy Ghost that shall not be forgiven unto men. But ask yourself this. What exactly is the Ukrainian war about? What caused the refugee crisis?This is, au fond, a war about national independence. Ukraine was invaded because it insisted on being a fully sovereign nation rather than accepting a semi-dependent status. Ukrainians, in other words, are fighting for the national principle, for their right to form their own state and live under their own laws.They understand, given their history, that this is the first and most important right. The other things that we and they value – fair trials, free elections, uncensored newspapers, personal autonomy – depend on being able to hire and fire their lawmakers. National independence does not guarantee these things but it does enable them. Poles, given their own history, also understand this very well.I am not trying to make a point-scoring Eurosceptic claim. Ukraine, after all, has asked to join the EU, though its circumstances are unique, and its application has to do with immediate security rather than comfortable arguments about self-determination. No, my point is a wider one. In a largely unremarked way, the Ukrainian war has vindicated the national principle – that is, the theory that government will work best where people feel common loyalties and affinities.Until recently, this was about the most low-status opinion imaginable. To be a nationalist was to be a Neanderthal, a Trumpster, a football hooligan, possibly an actual Nazi. Yet the conflict – a war between people who want to live in an independent country and people who don’t recognise their right to do so – has made several Western commentators realise, possibly for the first time, why national loyalty matters.It is our sense of national community, what Roger Scruton used to call “the politics of the first-person plural”, that makes liberal democracy possible. If we want government of, by and for the people, we first need to agree on being a people. Nationhood, and the shared patriotism on which it rests, is why we pay taxes to support strangers, why we obey laws with which we disagree, why we respect election results when our side loses. As the Italian radical Giuseppe Mazzini put it, in perhaps the pithiest ever summary, “Where there is a nation, let there be a state”.That creed is still loathed in Brussels. It is still despised by lots of cleverdicks in Britain. Perhaps you disagree with it. But look at what Ukrainians are suffering in its defence, look at what Poles are prepared to do to assist them, and then try and tell me that it doesn’t matter.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia kills 35 in attack on military base used by foreign soldiersSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russia ‘installs new mayor in Melitopol’Avoid sequins and don\u0026#39t throw away wine-stained outfits, Bafta tells starsHong Kong\u0026#39s freedom of press is nearing the \u0026#39end of the line\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ignore ofsted do best pupils government social mobility tsar","story":"Ignore Ofsted and do what is best for pupils, the Government\u0027s social mobility tsar has told headteachers.Katharine Birbalsingh, 49, said the inspecting body is “not a force for good” and urged teachers to “put the blinkers on” and “do what is right” for their children.  In a speech at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) conference in Birmingham on Saturday, she said bureaucracy should be banned because “people spend too much time writing stuff down and not enough time doing it”.Before becoming chair of the Social Mobility Commission in October last year, the Oxford-educated reformer was known as ‘Britain’s strictest headteacher’ for her rules at Michaela Community School, where she is founder and headteacher.Rules at the mixed secondary school in Wembley include detentions for those who don’t bring a ruler to class and for speaking in corridors.  In 2021, 82 per cent of its A-level cohort were offered places at Russell Group universities.Worrying about OfstedDuring her 30-minute-long speech, Ms Birbalsingh, who was made a CBE in 2020, claimed she had once convinced an Ofsted inspector visiting her school that assiduously writing everything down is a waste of time.While conceding that Ofsted\u0027s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, had done a “good job” so far and that the inspectorate is probably the “best it has ever been,” she added: “Too many of us understandably as leaders are constantly worried about what Ofsted is asking for.“You must try and just put the blinkers on and ignore it and just do what is right for your children and do what is right for your school…When the inspectors come you explain and you show.“If you have evidence for what you are doing and why you fight for that.”    In a Tweet in August 2021, she had called for Ofsted to be abolished claiming the damage it does to headteachers and other senior staff is “catastrophic”.In her speech, she said teachers should not be afraid to be disliked and should avoid “sentimentality” as having a backbone “is a mark of a good leader”.\u0027Believe in the children\u0027    She said: “Don’t be hurt if parents are upset with you or mean social media people – whoever it is that’s upset with you. You’ve got to believe in the children.”On smartphones, which Ms Birbalsingh claims hamper pupils\u0027 ability to learn, she recommended poorer children should not own them because it prevents them from being “socially mobile”.  As part of a digital detox initiative, pupils at Michaela are encouraged to give up their smartphones and video game console cables where they are housed in a safe for months at a time, she said.Roughly half of Year 11 students have voluntarily given their phones to staff to help them revise and many Year 7 and Year 8 pupils don’t own them at all.    In more challenging schools she would highly recommend a total silence policy because they can be horrible places where children get bullied.She added that pupils from poorer backgrounds who had not been explicitly taught material would see their middle-class peers answering questions and become demotivated.Speaking with toddlersWhat (the child) doesn\u0027t think at that moment is \u0027Well, I must be from a different socio-economic background, so that\u0027s why I couldn\u0027t answer.\u0027 What he thinks is, \u0027Gosh, I\u0027m dumb.\u0027 And then he starts poking Dave and poking John and keeps misbehaving, she said.Speaking on her role as chair of the Social Mobility Commission, she said not enough parents speak with their toddlers, an activity which improves their speech development.A 2014 study from Stanford University found that talking with infants and toddlers helped them grasp the rules and rhythms of language at an early age and provided them with a foundation to build up an understanding of how the world worked.Ms Birbalsingh has frequently criticised government bureaucracy, which she argues infringes on the autonomy and ability of schools.  Shortly after her appointment with the Social Mobility Commission, she said the body had frequently “wasted their time” writing reports that get “stuck on a website” that no one reads.  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia kills 35 in attack on military base used by foreign soldiersSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russia ‘installs new mayor in Melitopol’Avoid sequins and don\u0026#39t throw away wine-stained outfits, Bafta tells starsHong Kong\u0026#39s freedom of press is nearing the \u0026#39end of the line\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers need honest public hardship ahead","story":"As Putin’s monstrous war rages in Ukraine, it is impossible not to be consumed by rage and despair. In a war where the forces of good and evil couldn’t be clearer, it feels perverse to subject our own actions to scrutiny. And yet, if we are to understand how we found ourselves here and how we escape this tragedy, dispassionate analysis is essential. The uncomfortable reality is that the story of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine owes much to the hubris of a generation of Western leaders.This complacency was based on flawed assumptions about the possibilities of the post-Cold War world. At first this was understandable – the peaceful collapse of the Soviet Union and a democratic revolution in eastern Europe was such a remarkable event that it appeared as though we had escaped the great power competition of the past. Convinced they had entered a new age, Schroder, Chirac and Blair disregarded decades of geopolitical experience. A strong Nato alliance which had deterred Russia for 40 years was allowed to fray industrial strategy was disregarded as we took a punt on change through trade and the West’s energy dependency was ignored altogether.  But Western leaders remained trapped in the illusions of the 1990s even as reality stared them in the face. After Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, Merkel rewarded Russia by approving Nord Stream 2. This enriched the Kremlin, entrenched the EU’s energy dependency and advanced Putin’s goal of ending Ukraine’s status as a gas transit state. As Putin rebuilt his military and fought a war in the Donbas, only a third of European states met their Nato defence spending commitments. Certain of the ultimate victory of liberalism’s ideals, they ignored the fact that only hard military and economic power can deter tyrants like Putin, not hashtag diplomacy.We are now grappling with the consequences. Europe’s energy dependence on Russia has prevented the very toughest sanction package being assembled against Putin. Every day Russia receives $1.1 billion from the EU in oil and gas receipts, and to facilitate those payments Germany and Italy have blocked calls for the total expulsion of Russian banks from Swift.This crisis demands a new energy strategy. Decades of underinvestment in nuclear has cost us precious time and expertise, and so it is vital that the Government continues to rehabilitate nuclear energy at speed. Following our offshore wind revolution, the Government should expedite onshore wind where it is locally popular as the cheapest and quickest way to reduce our gas dependency, and invest in insulating homes, beginning with social housing and the poorest neighbourhoods, where recent schemes have proven successful.Let this be the end of the childlike debate we’ve witnessed where all decisions are binary. Renewables: good, domestic fossils fuels: bad, even during our transition to net zero, so we import them instead, rather than maximising our own resources. Our world class defence industry: bad, leading to pressure on pensions funds to est their stocks in a bid to comply with the ESG industry, when in fact we now look to them to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine.We must maximise North Sea oil and gas, urgently granting remaining licences, and we must revisit the case for fracking with the brutal clarity of what energy dependence on authoritarian powers looks like.However, there is a cost to defending a free Europe and the months ahead are likely to be amongst the most financially challenging we’ve known. Whilst the UK is only dependent on Russia for a tiny proportion of energy, we nevertheless remain exposed to global price spikes. With China’s demand for gas already forcing prices to record highs, the West’s move to cut out Russian oil and gas will lead it to spiral. And no matter how fast the government moves to increase our domestic energy output, it cannot reduce our exposure in the short-term.Despite positive GDP figures this week, there is a serious risk of a recession. Inflation will continue to be, by recent standards, astronomical. This will be a cruel living standards crunch, impacting the things people simply can’t avoid: heating your home and putting food on the table. Disposable incomes are forecast to fall by the largest amount since records began in the 1950s. As the Prime Minister and Chancellor did so well in the pandemic, they need to level with the public.The energy price cap gives a degree of breathing space to consider further support than that already announced. Given the likely hardship, more support soon seems inevitable and vital. But if the Conservatives want to be the party of lower tax and smaller government it cannot insulate us all from every global crisis. We will need to target our support carefully on the most vulnerable, for whom bills on the scale likely in October pose an impossible challenge.The Ukraine crisis reminds us that the world can be a dark place. There are no final victories: our liberty is fragile and must be constantly defended. That requires energy independence and credible deterrence. It will be a difficult year for many and we as a compassionate government must act to help them, but the West will emerge stronger from the tough lessons it has taught us.Robert Jenrick MP is a former Cabinet ministerMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia kills 35 in attack on military base used by foreign soldiersSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russia ‘installs new mayor in Melitopol’Avoid sequins and don\u0026#39t throw away wine-stained outfits, Bafta tells starsHong Kong\u0026#39s freedom of press is nearing the \u0026#39end of the line\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeons childish attention seeking proves scotland","story":"One senses that Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, misses the limelight she grabbed when Covid-19 was at its zenith. She seems instead to seek other means to keep her name before the public. It might be better for all, however, if she did so in a way that did not risk provoking the Third World War.Last week she showed her absence of statesmanship by demanding Nato “keep its mind open” on a no fly zone over Ukraine. The clear effect of such a zone, as even 14-year old armchair generals realise, would be that if a Russian jet flew into that airspace a Nato one would have to shoot it down. All right-thinking people feel nothing but revulsion for what the Russians are doing to Ukraine. But a no-fly zone could become a war between a nuclear-armed Nato and a nuclear-armed Russia: and no-one can so sure that the psychopath, sadist and narcissist who runs Russia would not launch such a weapon – unless, of course, he has taken Ms Sturgeon into his confidence.Normally, when Scotland’s First Minister says something absurd, her political opponents hesitate to take her on. Happily, this was not the Conservative Party’s response this time, as it realised the lethal consequences of her idiocy. Ministers are at last prepared to expose just how far out of her depth she is. Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, was right to call her remarks “utterly irresponsible”. The Ministry of Defence has briefed the Scottish government regularly on the situation, yet what Ms Sturgeon suggested was at odds with what Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Chief of the Defence Staff, had advised the Cabinet.There is a further paradox: although Ms Sturgeon seems willing to provoke the Third World War, she also wants to scrap the Trident missiles that would give the United Kingdom and her Nato allies a reasonable chance of avoiding the apocalypse. But because the Government at Westminster opposes a no-fly zone, for eminently sensible reasons, she seems to feel she has to call for one, just as during the pandemic she had to implement restrictions that began earlier, finished later, and were just that little bit more draconian. Like a spoilt child in a playground, she always has to be different, because in her ignorance she believes different is the same as better, and she has always to be better than the English oppressor.Similarly, as those she claims to represent struggle with increased energy bills, she opposes more drilling in the North Sea: frankly, if she really cared for their interests, she would sanction it tomorrow, and re-open some of Scotland’s coalmines too. Instead, her other concern last week was to apologise to the 4,000 or so people (about 15 per cent of whom were men) charged with Witchcraft under the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563, which she branded “injustice on a colossal scale”. She now advocates pardons for them, as she introduces an Orwellian law to make misogyny a criminal offence. Her only regret must be that the Act pre-dates the Act of Union, and all the great witch hunts also happened before 1707: otherwise one presumes the English taxpayer would be ordered to pay reparations.This desperate attention-seeking is another sign that peak Sturgeon has long passed: and it is harmless in that it diminishes only her and the fundamentally unserious cause of Scottish independence which she represents. And that cause will remain unserious so long as Ms Sturgeon and her acolytes act in such a petulant and irresponsible fashion.However, trying to pretend she understands international statesmanship is a more perilous activity, and one that shows her deeply unfit to lead. A period of silence, as Mr Attlee once put it, would be not only welcome, but perhaps life-saving. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia kills 35 in attack on military base used by foreign soldiersSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Russia ‘installs new mayor in Melitopol’Avoid sequins and don\u0026#39t throw away wine-stained outfits, Bafta tells starsHong Kong\u0026#39s freedom of press is nearing the \u0026#39end of the line\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lyse doucet not trying heroes do","story":"Lyse Doucet, the BBC’s chief international correspondent, has a voice that is famously distinctive. Her accent is technically Canadian (she speaks fluent French, plus bits of Arabic and Dari), but four decades spent travelling to lands from which everybody else is fleeing have turned it into a mixed brew. It is a voice from nowhere and everywhere, calm and authoritative. To hear Doucet, 63, on the radio or television is to know that something, in some corner of the world, is up. It\u0027s probably serious and probably complex, too. But don\u0027t worry, Lyse Doucet is there to explain it in a language we\u0027ll understand. And so it has been for the past two weeks, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.“She manages to be hugely brave and hugely vulnerable at the same time,” says her BBC colleague, Radio 4’s Today presenter Justin Webb, who first met her during the Afghanistan war in the 1980s. “Like the people whose plight she reports on, there’s a dignity to her, a kind of elemental human presence that gives voice to people whose names we don’t know but whose suffering we better understand.”Right now, Doucet is in Kyiv, a city kitted out for war. She is talking to me from quarters whose whereabouts she can’t reveal, and has to make frequent visits to the two-storey basement where she’s sheltering with colleagues, journalists, businessmen, visiting foreigners, as well as many Ukrainians, hiding out with their families, and pets – a dog called Kurt and a cat named Tyson. There were originally about 200 people but the number has halved now, as more and more opt to leave.The atmosphere in the basement has degraded recently, Doucet says, but they’re rallying, with that indefinable spirit we have all heard so much about in the recent harrowing, war-torn days. Does she think the Ukrainian spirit of resistance has been exceptional compared with other war zones she has visited, or is it just that thanks to technology that we hear more about it? “Well,” she says, “they feed off each other. People are sitting in a basement bunker glued to their phones, trying to keep their morale up. Hope is such a powerful ingredient. Ukrainians haven’t lost hope – every Ukrainian I speak to still says, ‘we will win this war’.“Once Putin said that Ukraine should not exist, Ukrainians became ever more Ukrainian, and more European too. I\u0027ve never seen a more spectacular own goal.”In this basement, Doucet says, there are stories which make your heart break, and stories that make it soar. “Early on it was our local producer’s birthday, Anna Chornous, and when I mentioned it there was a huge flurry of activity and a lady called Olga with a big warm smile immediately set about finding a candle and something approximating a cake. Along with her 13-year-old-daughter Sasha, they\u0027ve been working night and day in the shelter. Sasha started the invasion glued to her phone then shifted to proudly standing behind a big cauldron of soup.“And on International Women’s Day the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko and his brother were handing out flowers…”In times of the greatest inhumanity, says Doucet, we also find moments of the greatest humanity. “The woman with the pickles!” she exclaims, about the elderly lady who was standing on her balcony and took down a Russian drone by chucking a jar of pickles at it. “And the beautiful thing is, a Ukrainian journalist picked the story up, then people fact-checked it – due diligence – and found the woman, and she\u0027s really insulted: ‘No, no! she says. It was tomatoes. Fake news!’ And the story was corrected.”Doucet first came to Ukraine at the end of January – weighed down with satellite dishes, 15 cases of equipment, two engineers and her producer Michael Ertl, in anticipation of possible invasion – then left shortly afterwards. It was on February 18, when she was attending the Munich Security Conference, that things started really hotting up. “Boris Johnson, foreign ministers from all over Europe were there, and everyone was saying, is President Putin going to do it? Is he going to invade Ukraine? Even some very senior people were saying he wouldn’t. That was on Friday, By the Saturday they were thinking, maybe. And on Sunday, the mood had changed, and everyone was showing unprecedented resolve.“The BBC told me to go there directly, because there was talk of closing flights. So there I was, in a mild Munich winter with just the clothes you’d wear to interview foreign defence ministers…”  And off she went to Ukraine, with its sub-zero temperatures and imminent threat of war.She arrived in Kyiv at 4am on Monday, February 21. “Bright sunshine, steaming cups of coffee, full restaurants.” By Wednesday, she and her BBC colleagues in other parts of Ukraine were messaging each other – have you heard any explosions yet? “Then at 5am on Thursday, February 24, Russia moved across the border and that was it.”Doucet remembers looking at the magnificent golden domes of St Michael’s Monastery that morning, and listening to the bells. “For me, it became this reassuring chime – every hour, on the hour, the bells would ring out. And then we thought, wow, Russia’s military machine has crossed the border. By sheer numbers and firepower, they could be in Kyiv in days.“Some people are seeing this war through the prism of Syria, some are seeing it through the prism of the Second World War. This is a war of our time, with the most modern technology and weapons. I always say that everything has changed but nothing has changed: there is resonance with World War Two but this is a totally new war, with new people at the helm. We have to be conscious of that and hope against hope that this is going to turn out differently. Right now it looks really dark.”Firepower aside, in the charisma stakes at least, Ukraine is winning by a long chalk. It has President Zlenskiy, Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko, and Sergei Orlov, the poetic spokesman of poor, besieged Mariupol. Russia, on the other hand, has Sergey Lavrov.Trailblazing female correspondentsDoucet was born in New Brunswick, Canada, one of six children, with an Irish and Acadian heritage. Her father was a supervisor at the local paper mill. She went to university in Toronto and Ontario and became a reporter in West Africa she covered the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and was the BBC correspondent in Islamabad from 1989 to 1993, opened the BBC office in Amman, Jordan and spent four years as a correspondent in Jerusalem. She became a presenter for the BBC in 1999, was awarded an OBE in 2014, and has won many awards, including a Bafta nomination for her documentary, Children of Syria. Doucet stands inherently in the tradition of trailblazing female correspondents from Martha Gellhorn to Kate Adie, though she does not think of herself as a war correspondent, and she doesn’t have the reckless fervour of some of her colleagues. When she first arrived in Kyiv “when we were really staring into a black hole, thinking the tanks were going to come crashing in,” she got a message from her long-term friend Lindsey Hilsum, Channel 4’s international editor, saying: “Don’t do a Marie,” referring to their friend Marie Colvin, who was killed by artillery fire 10 years ago in Homs, Syria. Doucet and Hilsum started the Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network together with Marie’s friend Jane Wellesley, providing support to female journalists in the Arab world. “Marie was so driven,” says Doucet. “But I never took the risks that she did.” Forget about Russian troops, she says, her greatest fear is getting something wrong. “I think Lyse’s integrity shines through her reporting and people respond to that,” says Hilsum. “She reports very sensitively on the victims of war, but understands the political and diplomatic aspect too, so viewers and listeners understand the context. You always know you’re getting the truth from Lyse – there’s no prevarication. And – unlike some of our colleagues – she has no ego! The story is never about her and her own derring do. She doesn’t make her own considerable bravery apparent. She concentrates on other people’s stories. This is why she’s a good interviewer – of both the peasant and the president.” In keeping with this, Doucet is very keen to blow the trumpet of her team, some of whom she has worked with for years, and not to take the credit herself: “we depend on satellite engineers, camera people, video recorders, producers. We all play our part in telling the story – this is not a humblebrag, but what I do is no more important than the satellite engineer sitting in the dark trying to make the dish work.”She tells me about her Moscow Bureau editor, Kate Peters who had a grandmother, Lily Fernella Evans, who was the mayor of Dagenham during the Second World War and who approached Ford in Dagenham to refit a vehicle to operate as a mobile tea truck. She marvels at the courage of her Ukrainian colleagues – “When you’re a journalist but also a resident it adds a totally different dimension. The Ukrainian journalists are there in the basement, tapping away at their computers – one of them has his ‘editorial cat’ on his lap – and they’re looking at the same videos that I’m looking at. But they’re thinking ‘My grandmother lives there!’ Or ‘I used to go to school there…’”Her team and her colleagues are everything to her. ‘Meet me, meet my gang,” she says. “There’s an esprit de corps. It’s a bonding together of the tribe. Being there in all the commotion is what really matters. This is our family now and everyone plays a role. “And most of us want to stay here for the same reason that a doctor wants to finish an operation and an artist wants to finish his picture. We started this story and we want to see the end of it, even though sheer exhaustion might drive us away.Doucet’s conversation often has the polish of one of her carefully crafted broadcasts, with a dramatic beginning, a rather poetic middle, and a pay-off at the end. “This will be remembered in history,” she tells me at one point. “Places we never knew existed: Sumi, or Mariopul, or Irpin. Tragically we are hearing about these charming little tree-lined towns just as they’re being wiped off the map.“This war is touching hearts around the world in a way that I’ve never seen before. Ukraine is dominating our lives. When I listen to the news bulletins, all the news is about Ukraine, the sport is about Ukraine, the business is about Ukraine – it’s only the weather that’s not – and by the way, the weather is really cold here.”Friends and family – and homeI had heard her on Desert Island Discs saying: “I live constantly bathed in a sense of gratitude” and I wonder, how does she maintain such peace of mind? How does she ward off post traumatic stress? She has meditated for 10years “though I’ve not done it in the bunker – people would say, what’s wrong with her?” Her Twitter biog says: ‘Canada is my country, London is my city, but I am at home in many places.’ She feels equally at home in Kabul or Jerusalem, where she is always welcomed, but her main home is in London, where, she says, she behaves like a flaneur. “When I am back in a London rhythm of life, I like walking, swimming, of course seeing friends from all the places dear to my heart who live in London or visit. I like hanging out in my neighbourhood which is peaceful, along the canals, so by water which is how I grew up. It brings my world down to walking distance, which is nice.”She has no children or long term partner, and wakes up to a daily flurry of WhatsApp and social media messages from her siblings and nieces, her colleagues, and a daily poem from Hilsum. “I have a lot of friends and a very strong family – I feel loved by a lot of people.” She also gets ‘a cascade’ of messages from fans worrying about her “which gives you pause for thought but also strengthens your sense of self. As a journalist you want to be respected and as a person you want to be loved.”The last time she cried was the other day, when her colleague, BBC’s Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenburg, also a master pianist, played his own composition, Isolation, on the Today programme. She does not betray much emotion on air.  “Nobody wants to see my emotion, it doesn’t matter – except to me. We’re here to report, and convey what’s happening here.

The Prime Minister said it was simply incorrect and would obviously be extraordinaryhe had intervened to secure a gong for Lord Lebedev. But the claims reignited the row over the numbers of allies who have received gongs from the PM. Labour have demanded a “post-appointment assessment” to examine the contributions of peers the Prime Minister places in the Lords. Here we look at some of allies, cronies and Tory donors who have been handed top gongs. Evgeny Lebedev  The Prime Minister made Evgeny Lebedev, the media mogul and son of billionaire ex-KGB agent Alexander, Lord Lebedev of Siberia at the height of Covid in . The ex-London mayor had for years been a guest at parties hosted by the socialite who owns the Evening Standard. As Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson declared an “overnight stay” with Evgeny Lebedev on  April . Reports later claimed the future Prime Minister had gone to Palazzo Terranova in Perugia for a “weekend-long party - and was spotted dishevelled and without his security detail at San Francesco d’Assisi airport the next day. Claims emerged this week that intelligence officials had raised concerns about the gong - leading the House of Lords Appointments Commissionto advise against it.But a source told the Sunday Times Boris Johnson then personally intervened - meeting Lebedev in person while he was dithering over a lockdown - and that “particular quite damning bit of advice” was later withdrawn.Mr Johnson has insisted it is “simply incorrect” that he personally or directly asked for the advice to be reversed. Lord Lebedev has not spoken in the Lords since his maiden speech, and Insider revealed he had only attended the Lords three times - narrowly missing the six-month absence that triggers an automatic suspension.On Friday, Lord Lebedev, who holds British citizenship, released a statement, saying he was not some agent of Russia .The peer acknowledged that his father was a long time ago a KGB officer but denied being a security risk to this country Jo Johnson  On just one day two years ago, Boris Johnson put his former boss, a billionaire Tory donor, a former top aide and a Brexiteer cricketer in the House of Lords for le . But the most striking name in his peers’ list of  July  was that of Jo Johnson - his own brother. The long-awaited list was snuck out on a hot Friday afternoon, hours after an important Covid announcement. Its huge size was branded a mockery of democracy and slammed by the Lordsapos own Speaker.Jo Johnson stood down as an MP at the  election and resigned as a minister, saying he was torn between family loyalty and the national interest over his brother’s hardline approach to Brexit.David Harding The billionaire, who has donated large sums to the Conservative Party, was handed a knighthood in the  New Year Honours.Hedge fund boss David Harding was knighted for “services to philanthropy”. The -year-old’s gts to science and mathematics programmes include £million to Cambridge University in  - the largest ever single donation by a Brit to a UK university.However, he is also a major donor to the Conservative Party, having pumped more than £.million into the Tory war chest since . Sir David, who founded investment management firm Winton in , donated more than £m to pro-Remain groups in the EU referendum. In  he was named as a member of the Tory Leader’s Group, offering him the chance to dine with ministers including then-PM Theresa May. But he has also generously helped the party under Brexiteer Boris Johnson, donating almost £, to the Tories since the PM came to power. His gts include a single £, donation a few weeks before the  election.Zac Goldsmith Tory Zac Goldsmith lost his seat in the  election after being trounced by the Liberal Democrats in Richmond Park.But he was swtly handed a le peerage by Boris Johnson so he could serve as Environment Minister in the Lords.The Tory, son of billionaire businessman James Goldsmith, ran in the  London Mayoral election but he was denounced for trying to suggest his Labour rival Sadiq Khan had links to extremists. A long-time ally of the PMaposs we Carrie Johnson, Mr Goldsmith made headlines last year for lending the couple his luxury Marbella villa for a sunshine break.Michael Spencer  The billionaire former treasurer of the Conservative Party was among the  receiving a Tory peerage in July . His firm IPGL Ltd has donated more than £m to the Tories since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.He was another member of the Tories’ elite ‘Leaders’ Group’, listed as a dinner attendee in early  with either Boris Johnson, Philip Hammond or Theresa May, or all three.The City grandee slammed Theresa May in  for “letting herself down” in her relationship with business, saying the party had been foolish on occasion to adopt some of the language of the socialists”. He later poured money into target seats ahead of the  election landslide. Daniel Moylan  Now Lord Moylan, Daniel Moylan was aviation advisor to Mr Johnson as London Mayor, when he championed a failed plan to build a Thames estuary airport nicknamed Boris Island. The ex-merchant banker and diplomat was ennobled in  alongside several others from the PMaposs City Hall days.He recently went on a bizarre Twitter rant, describing Yorkshire as a county of leftist whingers.His outburst came after the Yorkshire Post reported the governmentaposs levelling up plans were failing to deliver. Posting the front page of the paperaposs weekend edition, the former deputy leader of Kensington and Cha Council said: I’m going to Yorkshire for a short break next week. Everything I’ve read recently in @yorkshirepost makes me fear I’m going to find it transformed into a county of leftist whingers begging for handouts. Let’s hope that’s not the case. Charles Moore  Among those given a peerage in summer  by Boris Johnson was his former boss. Charles Moore, previously said his role at the Dailywas a nightmare because the future PM was always terribly late with his copy. In November  he was at a dinner in London to which the Prime Minister rushed back in a jet from the COP climate summit in Glasgow. Lord Moore has described himself of a climate change sceptic and criticised the repressive hostility from policy elites in an article for thein October. At around the same time, Lord Moore wrote a piece complaining about the “hounding” of Tory MP Owen Paterson, who an inquiry found had breached standards rules. A short time after the dinner, Boris Johnson tried to change Commons rules to save Mr Paterson - leading to outrage and weeks of sleaze headlines. Edward Lister  Another long-time City Hall ally, Eddie Lister was handed a peerage by Boris Johnson in autumn . The -year-old led Tory Wandsworth Council for nearly  years and served as an adviser to Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor.He was brought into No when when Mr Johnson became PM in July  and became acting chief of staff after the dramatic departure of Dominic Cummings in November . Lord Udny-Lister left Government in April .He apologised last year for approving a £million taxpayer-backed loan to a big property developer he was being paid to advise. Geoffrey Cox  Top Conservative Geoffrey Cox – one of Parliament’s biggest earners outside Westminster – was made a Sir in New Year Honours under Boris Johnson. Sir Geoffrey gave up his work as a top-earning QC on being appointed to Cabinet in  - which had previously made him Westminster’s highest paid MP. He vehemently defended Boris Johnson in the Brexit wars and his attacks on the “dead parliament” he inherited from Theresa May. But he later ran into controversy in  when he advised Boris Johnsonaposs government that it was legal to prorogue Parliament - which was later found to be unlawful by the Supreme Court. Sir Geoffrey made headlines in  when it emerged he had tried to claim p for milk before his demand was knocked back by the Parliamentary expenses watchdog. The same year he stood down as the chair of Westminster’s cross-party standards committee, after failing to declare more than £, in outside earnings. He was later ordered to apologise in the Commons for failing to declare the sum within the -day time period. Last year he was embroiled in a second jobs row over his role advising the government of the British Virgin Islands. Tony Gallagher  The multi-millionaire property developer and Tory donor who hosted David Cameronaposs th birthday party was knighted in autumn . He entertained the former Prime Minister at Sarsden House, a listed th-Century Oxfordshire mansion set in  acres which Sir Tony bought for £million in . The entrepreneur is said to be part of the so-called Chipping Norton set centred around the pretty Cotswolds town in the former Tory leaderaposs old Oxfordshire constituency. The two men reportedly came to know one another when Mr Cameron became the local MP and since  Mr Gallagher has donated more than £, to the Conservatives. In , Boris Johnson registered a gt from Mr Gallagher of a sterling silver envelope worth £ following the birth of his son Wilfred. Downing Street said later that the present had been entered on the parliamentary register in error and was being removed as the PM had opted toit. Claire Fox  The former Brexit Party MEP was handed a seat in the Lords in . Once a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, she was criticised for the groupaposs refusal to condemn the  IRA bombings in Warrington. In  she tweeted in praise of the Liberal Democrats for not taking up peerages - only five years before she joined the House of Lords. Ian Botham  The former England cricketer was given a peerage by Boris Johnson as he marked his first anniversary in No . Lord Botham was reportedly rewarded for his support for Brexit among a list of Eurosceptic loyalists honoured by the PM.He was a high-profile figure pushing for Brexit, branding the EU corrupt and a racket and saying in : Cricket is a game where you achieve the greatest success when you are confident in your own ability to go out and stand proud. Britain has that spirit.He was named as the UKaposs trade envoy to Australia last year.

The Government bowed to pressure over the speed of its response to helping Ukrainian refugees, with an online visa application system starting this week.Western officials, and even the Prime Minister have expressed growing concern that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.Ukraineaposs president Volodymyr Zelensky, who has faced a number of assassination attempts, has said he is no longer pressing for Nato membership for Ukraine but made a historic address in the House of Commons. While the Prime Ministeraposs poll ratings have slightly recovered since the Mirror first published stories on Downing Street lockdown parties, the Government appear to have used the crisis as a time to announce a number of controversial decisions.Here are five things the Tories have snuck out or have been forced to reveal since Russia invaded Ukraine.... Gavin Williamsonaposs knighthoodGavin Williamson, the gaffe-prone Tory who presided over the Covid exams chaos and was sacked by Theresa May as Defence Secretary, was handed the top gong, No confirmed.Ex-No chief of staff Gavin Barwell also claimed last year that Mr Williamson had vowed to unleash “the world’s biggest s**tshow” on the Government when he was fighting for his job as Defence Secretary in . Mr Williamson was sacked as Education Secretary in Boris Johnsonaposs last reshuffle after coming under intense criticism over his handling of the education brief during the pandemic.He came under fire for the  exams chaos and repeated U-turns over free school meals policy, which saw the Government shamed into feeding children over the holidays by footballer Marcus Rashford. He then hit the headlines in September by confusing Rashford with another black sportsman, the rugby player Maro Itoje. Graduates to pay £, more after student loan shake-upPoorer graduates face paying £, more over their letimes under a major Tory shake-up of student loans. The Institute for Fiscal Studieswarned that Brits on below average incomes would lose out on a higher chunk of their earnings due to changes to student finance rules. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . This means some people will still be making repayments into their s. The IFS believes those on lower middle incomes will pay back £, more after revising its estimates in line with inflation rather than average earnings. The reforms would mean that more than halfof students who take out a loan would repay this in full, compared to % currently estimated. Tuition fees will be capped at £, for a further two years, while student loan interest rates will be set no higher than the rate of inflation from  . But the Government quietly rejected the reportaposs key call to slash tuition fees to £,-a-year. Terms of reference for the Covid inquiry The Government has finally published its draft terms of reference for the public inquiry into their handling of the Covid pandemic. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry last year after fury at his slow decisions to lock down, which scientists believe cost lives.Retired judge Lady Hallett is set to examine the public health response, how decisions were made, the economic response including the furlough scheme, the procurement of personal protective equipment and even the closure of schools.But the draft Terms of Reference do not name Boris Johnson or promise to look at the inidual behaviour of the Prime Minister.That could come as a blow to bereaved families after ex-aide Dominic Cummings accused him of a litany of failings. Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “The inquiry is a one off and historic opportunity for the terrible suffering and loss of the past two years to be learned from, to ensure these tragedies are not repeated in the future.“The Government finally publishing the draft Terms of Reference is a huge step forward, and we look forward to feeding into the consultation on them. “Sadly, today’s announcement comes far too late. We will never know how many lives could have been saved had the Government had a rapid review phase in Summer , as we called for at the time. Teachersapos pay Government proposals to hike salaries for experienced teachers by % in   and % the next year would amount to a pay cut for most staff, teaching unions said.The plans, set out in the official response to the pay review body, would also see new teachers salaries boosted to £,-a-year by  , in line with a Tory manesto commitment.But the union leaders warned that the plans amounted to another signicant real-terms pay cut for most teachers once inflation rates are taken into account.Brits are facing a spiralling cost of living crisis, with inflation rising to .% in January.Public sector pay rises were put on hold in   for all staff except NHS workers and those who earned less than £, due to heavy borrowing during the pandemic. Unused PPE bought during Covid will be burnedThe Government is planning to burn mountains of unusable personal protective equipment bought during the Covid pandemic, MPs have been told.A top Department of Health official said the plan was designed to find somefor . billion pieces of faulty or low quality kit that the NHS cannot use. Around £. billion spent by the Government on useless protective gear was written off by the Government, accounts for   revealed last month.Some £ million worth of equipment was found to be totally unusable, and £ million was spent on items that were not used before their expiry date. Officials are now planning to ship off around , pallets of wasted PPE to power plants to burn each month - around  lorryloads of kit. Rishi Sunak - Partygate questionnaireRishi Sunak joined the list of more than  people to receive a questionnaire from the Met Police to explain any involvement in gatherings at Downing Street.It is understood the Chancellor received the form, which needed to be ed within seven days as requested by Scotland Yard. The Met is looking into  alleged gatherings held across Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdown rules under Operation Hillman.Mr Sunak previously confirmed he was at Boris Johnsonaposs birthday do, held by No staff and the PM’s we Carrie on June , . But he insisted he had been present at the Cabinet Room for a routine meeting to discuss Covid. Earlier this month, he appeared to suggest he was not expecting to receive a form to complete. Asked on Sky News earlier this monthhe expected to receive a form, he replied: No... well, I donapost know.

He spoke out during a visit to Birmingham Children’s Hospital today when he was asked whether he intended to bring forward a fourth booster shot. He said: When it comes to vaccinations and any future vaccinations, we listen carefully to what our expert advisers have to say in the JCVI. They have said recently... that certainly for groups of people, the over-s, immunosuppressed, those in residential care homes, they will receive a second booster shot... a fourth dose, and that will begin in the coming weeks.  We are preparing for that, and that will be recommended for those that have had at least a six-month gap between that dose and their previous one. When pushed further, he added: We keep it under review, but the right thing to do is to listen to the expert advice... Iaposm very confident with our approach. In February last month, Mr Javid said that the most vulnerable and at risk groups would receive a fourth dose in coming weeks. This was to help ensure they maintained a high-enough level of protection against the deadly virus.  Those who are eligible will be offered the jab around six months after their last dose. The latest figures have shown that, for the first time since the end of January, all four home nations have seen week-on-week spikes in infections.Figures published by the ONS infection survey show that, across the UK as a whole, . million people were estimated to have coronavirus last week. That number stood at . million at the start of the year, however this is a rise from . million.Mr Javid said the Government was continuing to monitor the situation very carefully in response to a rise in Covid- infections among the elderly and in childrenaposs hospitals.Obviously we monitor the situation regularly, we keep it under review, but at this stage things are very steady as we learn to live with Covid, he said. It does underline the importance of the defences we have built. Getting vaccinated, particularlyyou havenapost been vaccinated already, is very important. Whilst itaposs great to see, when it comes to the boosters, eight out of  adults have had their booster shots, those two out of  that have not yet come forward - itaposs still a very good time to come forward.

According to the Times, the Government has decided people who want to offer a home to those fleeing the war under the new scheme will need to commit to a six-month contract. The newspaper cited a Government source as saying: Itaposs about making sure we have secure offers. Unfortunately itaposs going to need to be a long-term scheme as it doesnapost look like theyaposll be going home any time soon. The Times said ministers hope the bulk of offers to the sponsorship scheme will come from accommodation providers such as hotels, BBs and landlords, to bring in as many people as possible. Hosts and their properties will need to pass safeguarding checks, after which they will be matched with Ukrainian refugees in Poland by Home Office officials, it said. Labour leader Keir Starmer told the Times he would take in a Ukrainian refugee himself.If necessary , as many people would... I think weaposre a very welcoming nation, he told the newspaper.It comes after the Government was reported to have come under fire from French President Emmanuel Macron for its policy on Ukrainian refugees.According to the , at the end of an EU summit in Versailles on Friday, Mr Macron said insisting visa applications to the UK were made in person in Brussels and Paris had exacerbated circumstances for those fleeing the war.The Home Office pointed to previous comments by Home Secretary Priti Patel, who said: We are now making the process quicker and simpler by removing the need to physically visit visa application centres for many of those who are making the perilous journey across Europe.On Thursday, she announced that from Tuesday people will be able to apply online for a visa and will no longer have to go to a processing centre to give their biometrics.Nearly . million people are thought to have fled Ukraine since Russiaaposs invasion on February , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesdata portal. Tony Stein, chief executive of Healthcare Management Solutions, suggested on Saturday morning that Ukrainian people fleeing the war could find jobs and a place to live through the UK care sector.Askedhis business might be interested in taking part in the Governmentaposs new sponsorship scheme for refugees, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Absolutely. I mean, we have a national shortage in the care sector of people. We have many vacancies up and down the country.A lot of operators have job-related accommodation. And there must be a way, I think, of putting the two things together and helping some of the refugees coming over, who may well have the skills that weaposre looking for... they may be nurses or people whoaposve cared before who would be perfectly suited to roles in this country. But I think itaposs not a simple thing to do. You know, clearly there are some issues that we need to address - sopeople are coming over with children, for example... the accommodation may not be suited for families, and indeed local authorities might not allow us to house families in some of that accommodation. The start point is: have we got accommodation, do we have vacancies  Yes we do. We just now need to work together with local authorities and Government to find out how we can do this. Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford told peers , visas for Ukrainian refugees had been issued as of Thursday morning, adding: Those figures are going up rapidly and that is a good thing.

Ministers got the most cash for London’s Camberwell Green court at £.million - and the least for the th Century one at Ely, Cambs which the city council bought for just £ so it could relocate there. New figures show ministers have sold off  court buildings out of  since the Tories came to power in  as part of cost cutting measures. Yet because of the pandemic magistrates courts are taking nearly three months to hear cases and the crown court backlog will not be cleared until . Shadow Justice Secretary Steve Reed said: “This soft-on-crime Conservative Government have brought about record delays in our courts because of these short-sighted selloffs. “Victims are waiting years for their day in court while criminals aren’t brought to justice. The Conservatives are letting criminals off and letting victims down.”  As buildings were sold cases were switched to nearby courts, though critics say this has increased journey times and makes it dficult for single mums and the disabled to get there. The courts went to private buyers, property developers and local authorities Rochdale court was sold for £, to the trustees of a mosque and London’s Bow County Court for £.million to an evangelical mission. The Ministry of Justice says the courts closed were underused and £million from sales have been reinvested to introduce new technology and online services.Justice minister James Cartlidge added: “The decision to close any court is not taken lightly. “It only happens following full public consultation and only when effective access to justice can be maintained.” But former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland blamed delays in hearing cases on budget cuts as well as Covid. Extra Nightingale courts were introduced during the pandemic to increase the capacity.

But in a humiliating show for his leader, Krishtop begged Ukrainians for forgiveness, admitting he had committed terrible crimes by fighting in Putinaposs war. Instead he described the Russian mission to capture Kyiv as pointless and urged his comrades to stop fighting. Lt Col Krishtop said: The invasion of such a huge city as Kyiv is pointless – it will lead to huge losses of le on both sides, and huge destruction. Follow the Russia Ukraine conflict live here with our live blog I urge you stop following criminal orders, stop fighting, and stop killing civilians – you can see we have already lost this war. But the conflict continues to be unrelenting with Russian troops now said to be driving west after wreaking havoc in the east. Satellite aposbefore and afterapos images of the port city of Mariupol show its luscious trees and beautul buildings flattened to a barren wasteland. Russian troops have been trying to seize it as a tactical move since the start of the conflict, in a bid to strangle the Ukraine economy by controlling key exports. The eastern city of Mykovail has also been encircled as Putinaposs forces are now said to be heading towards Odessa in the west.  President Zelensky urged Russian forces to comply with an agreed ceasefire so refugees could safely evacuate. But the Ukraine intelligence service claimed that these pleas were being ignored as it issued a statement that Russians had shot women and children fleeing for their lives. It said: Russians shot a column of women and children while trying to evacuate from the village of Peremoha in the Kyiv region along an agreed aposgreenapos corridor. After the attack, the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out of the village.Instead Russia has been using the opportunity to send in new troops, Ukraine claims.French President, Emmanuel Macron, said that President Putin was not willing to make peace. The claims followed a futile  minute phone call on Saturdaybetween France, Germanyaposs Olaf Scholz and the Russian aggressor, to find a way out of the war. Western leaders have this week expressed growing fears that Putin will unleash devastating chemical weapons in his bid for power.

Amy said: “So many people have been touched by William’s story. They can see what a wonderful young man he is. We’ve had lots of people come forward in the hope that they are the crucial donor. “We are so thankful to everyone who has supported us throughout this horrendous ordeal.” As we revealed in November, a rare disease called FSGS has wrecked William’s kidneys. Doctors at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital ruled out a transplant because of complications – including his autism and ADHD – and recommended palliative care.  But a judge ruled that the young golf fanatic should have a transplant and continue dialysis. Amy, , of Newton, Lancs, added: “I especially want to thank the judge for taking the time to meet William. I feel that played a big part in the decision. “Being a parent of a child with a learning disability shouldn’t mean you have to fight for what is given to other children and adults.  “And just because a doctor is a professional doesn’t mean they are always right. “Parents know their children best.” Children with William’s condition usually live to around  but can get to  after a transplant.

The heartbroken dad told the coroner: I begged him not to do it. Sam was initially taken to Tameside Hospital, and later referred to the critical care unit at Manchester Royal Infirmary. On July , Sam’s condition continued to deteriorate further and he was sadly pronounced dead on July . Senior coroner Alison Mutch, told Sam’s family: “I have to say how you managed to do all of that under those circumstances says a lot about your commitment to try and do the best for him. I understand it must have been a very dficult situation for everyone.” If you are affected by this story there are many people who would be happy to talk to you: Samaritans If you need to talk and donapost know where to turn to, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The coroner added: “It’s a tribute to your brevity as a family that even in his darkest hours, you were keen to follow your son’s wishes to ensure his organs were donated to give others le evenhe couldn’t live. Of course, it doesn’t bring him back but I hope it served as a small comfort at a very dficult time of grief.” The court heard how Sam joined Oasis Academy Leesbrook in Oldham in  as a P.E. teacher but also regularly taught science and maths.  The school described him as an ‘exceptional and gted teacher’ who was ‘valued and respected’ by staff, students and their parents. Sam later became an assistant deputy at the academy and had been ‘instrumental’ in developing the school’s culture. Describing his son as a keen footballer, Mr Jones said his family were ‘incredibly proud’ of him. “He had a great love for sport,” he told the court. “He was so competitive - being second was not something he would ever accept. He played semi-pro football and played for a number of local teams including Wythenshawe Town FC. “Up to , he was an excellent goalkeeper. Two or three professional clubs even wanted to sign him as a goalkeeper but unfortunately he had lost a love for it. He wanted glory, he wanted to be scoring goals. “He was the first one in the family to ever go to university. It cost mum and dad a lot of money and he went twice. We were very proud of him.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

The inquest heard how there had been nothing in Sam’s medical records to indicate he had expressed any concerns with his mental health or had similar thoughts in the past. “Before this, there had been no inkling that this was going to happen to your son and was completely out of character,” Ms Mutch said. It was out of the blue for someone with such a promising career, Ms Mutch said. No notes were found and nothing suspicious was noted in a toxicology report or police investigation.The coroner said she was unable to rule Sam’s death as suicide as there was no clear evidence to suggest he had fully understood the severity of his actions. His death was therefore ruled as the consequence of self-asphyxiation. Addressing Sam’s family upon making the conclusion, Ms Mutch said: “You obviously loved him very much and wanted to support him as much as possible. You were very close to him and wanted to make sure he had the best and most supportive environment. “That level of support is shown on the day when Sam was found. As a mother, I’m sure that is a conversation that will be impossible to forget. “You absolutely did the right thing straight away and I think it shows just how well you knew your son that you knew he would be at the cemetery.” Ms Mutch added: “I can’t imagine this is something you’re ever going to be able to forget. It sounds asyou did everything you could to stop what happened, but unfortunately, notwithstanding your pleas to him, the damage had already been done. “Those must have been very dark and dficult days for you all.” The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

It forced Kate to apologise for not wearing a pretty dress in a very cute exchange. Instead of a glitzy gown, Kate opted for a Hobbs coat, Zara dress and an eye-catching Beulah London scarf. Rhian explained at the time: My daughter loves fairy tales and Cinderella, and she was really excited to meet a real princess. Kate said aposIaposm really sorry Iaposm not wearing a pretty dress todayapos and Annabel said: aposI thought youaposd look like Cinderellaapos.

Buckingham Palace confirmed last month that they would be travelling to the Caribbean for a week-long trip to help mark the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee.

Itaposs a time when all members of the Royal Family come together to celebrate the Commonwealth and to honour the Queen - and the  event is set to take place tomorrow.The Covid- pandemic forced the event to be cancelled last year but the last service - held in  - was also the final royal engagement for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Weeks before the event, the pair made the bombshell announcement they would be quitting as senior royals and leaving the UK. For the service, Meghan memorably wore a vibrant green Emilia Wickstead cape dress that started blowing in the wind as she left the Abbey.And according to Christine Ross, the editor of the blog Meghanaposs Mirror, Meghan used the dress to send a secret but powerful message.She believes that it was a clear signal to the designer and to the people who claimed the two women had a complicated relationship.

Speaking previously on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: One of the most iconic looks is going to be her green Emilia Wickstead cape dress. That cape blowing in the wind as she walked into the church and then walked out of the church, which was such an emotional moment for so many people as it was their last formal engagement as royals. That green dress will stand out in history books I think.  She then went on to explain the complicated story between Meghan and Wickstead, which came from an interview the designer did with a magazine. Christine says that Wickstead described Meghanaposs wedding dress as simple, and taken out of context in other reports left many believing she was criticising the dress. She said: It was a pull quote from a larger interview, she really didnapost say anything negative.  People thought Emilia Wickstead had really wronged Meghan, and it turned out that Emilia Wickstead hadnapost wrong Meghan, it was a pull quote. Maybe a month or so later Meghan actually wore a custom Emilia Wickstead dress, and that situation shows the power of Meghanaposs fashion choices. She was able to say with this fashion choice, Emilia Wickstead and I are great. Weaposre on great terms, that whole thing was a huge misunderstanding and look at the lovely dress she designed for me. However, Meghan isnapost the only fan of Emilia Wicksteadaposs designs - her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge has worn her pieces multiple times.Kateaposs most memorable looks include a stunning purple trouser suit she wore to Northern Ireland last year and a gorgeous blue dress she donned while meeting Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky and first lady Olena Zelenska at Buckingham Palace in .Meanwhile, another fan is Sophie Wessex, who has also worn Emilia Wickstead designs at Royal Ascot.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brits are being clobbered by rocketing energy bills, rising inflation and hikes to national insurance from April, while itaposs forecasted that the cost of essential foods such as bread, potatoes and pasta is likely to rise by between % and % over the coming months. According to a think-tank, every UK household could soon be £, worse off due to the rising costs.Now, people living in Huddersfield have admitted they are taking drastic measures in order to save money, with one woman even claiming that some families are struggling to feed their children, Yorkshire Live reports. Anne Wilkinson, who was shopping at Leeds Road retail park, said her and her husband, who are both retired, are having to be more cautious about what we use.  We are not travelling as much as we would have done in the past , she said. My son lives over in Manchester and when we want to go and see him it is going to be a lot more expensive. We are not absolutely sure what other things might affect us until we get the bills in - there is some uncertainty. I am not surethings like council tax will go up. Anne added she is in a fortunate position but said her previous work as a foster carer means she knows many families who are struggling. A lot of families have no food in the house or electricity because they dare not turn things on. Some people are struggling to feed their children. It makes you cross because you think to yourself: aposIs it all absolutely necessaryapos   Mrs Greaves, who did not want to give her first name, lives in Springbank Road, which falls within an area recently named the second-most deprived in Huddersfield. The mum admitted that she has started to batch cook in order to minimise the number of times she used her cooker. I started cooking for the next two days when I noticed the prices were going up, she said. That way, I do not have to stand over the cooker again because I have done it all in one day. I will cook on Saturday for that evening and also for Sunday so I am not doing two sets of dishes. Once I have cooked, everything is switched off - thataposs it. Then I only have to use the microwave to warm it up . The mum continued: My central heating is on a timer and I do not have a gas fire. The only thing I use everyday is my washing machine.My house insurance has gone up as well, but it is the gas and electric that is the killer. I think that is what is hitting everyoneaposs pockets. With experts forecasting costs may rise further, Mrs Greaves added that it could result in increased levels of crime in the area. Some people canapost eat, she said. I can see more break-ins this year. Some people do not know how they are going to manage. When winter hits them, I think people will be in even more poverty. Sadia Rana, who has lived in Springbank Crescent for  years, said that her bills had risen for WiFi, gas and electric. I cannot say le is aposnormalapos because I have less savings, she said. I am paying more than normal so it means I canapost spend on other things. I think prices will rise again. My son is always watching the news before bed and there are reports every day that prices are going up.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decided their future is not in the UK, while Prince Andrew is not expected to everto public le.But the enforced alterations donapost begin to scratch the surface of whataposs ahead, some believe.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Charles has long been prepping for the new era and he has Palace hangers-on firmly in his eye-line. It has long been said that the -year-old plans a major shake-up of the when he becomes head of state - and it could also affect royal residences. It remains to be seen which members of the family will be trimmed but analyst Jonathan Sacerdoti told the Mirrror things are about to become very modern.He said: I think when Charles takes to the throne we will see the emphasis put on those who command absolute respect.  The demands of responsibility and certain behaviours that are needed will be at the forefront - simply, you must be totally reliable. It is well known that Charles wants to stamp his mark and in modern times, donapost be surprised to see changes made. It will be a very handy way to respond to the recent controversies, such as Prince Andrew, as well as Prince Harryaposs attacks on the family. The core will be there, and Prince George will join in time - I think that is clear.  But it’s always been speculated that Charles, when he eventually takes over, will want to slim down the working royals at the heart of the family. It will be about commanding respect. I think he is looking forward to being King. It is not simply a change of personnel thataposs ahead of us. Senior royals are acutely aware of the requirement to prove they are value for money and the weight of this responsibility has weighed heavily on the Prince of Wales.  Opening of Buckingham Palace to the public is one idea that the future king is said to be keen to explore. Thereaposs a sense that he wants a slimmed down monarchy to make sure that everybody is doing their bit and [there are] no so-called hangers-on, royal expert Camilla Tominey said. “It does make the future of the monarchy kind of uncertain. “We’ve had this model that the Queen has been at the head of for all of this time, because she’s obviously been on the throne for nearly seven decades.”“That means by association that you’re going to have fewer royals taking on fewer patronages, and then what does that mean for the charities ” she told The ’s Royal Insight podcast.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Buckingham PalacePrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Palace did not give a specic reason for her planned absence from the event.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester have also cancelled their attendance because the duke has tested positive for COVID-.Itaposs thought the Queen may never be well enough to walk them again, The Sun reports.A palace source said: “She is not well enough. “The Queen usually turns to her beloved corgis in time of crisis and stress and took them out almost every day after Philip fell ill and then died last year. They are an enormous source of solace, so it is a real shame.” The Queen has always found solace in her loyal pet pooches, particularly in the aftermath of the death of her husband Prince Philip in April last year In her absence, palace aides now take her two corgis and dorgi out for their daily exercise, sources claim.A senior royal source said: “Dogs remain very much part of Windsor le.” It comes after the Queen cancelled an appearance at Monday’s annual Commonwealth Day service after suffering problems with her mobility. The -year-old monarch is understood to be experiencing increasing discomfort when it comes to getting about. Her Majesty will instead be represented by the Prince of Wales, Buckingham Palace said.  The head of state, who has recently recovered from a bout of Covid, hoped to join Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Commonwealth event. The ­decision is not linked to any illness but is related to the Queen’s comfort of getting to and from the service. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey.” The service would have been the Queen’s first major public appearance since reaching her Platinum Jubilee milestone, and the first Commonwealth Day service held in full since .Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said she believed the Queen would be “determined” to make the Thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey dedicated to her late husband Prince Philip on March .Ms Seward said: “It would have been a huge wrench to miss the Commonwealth Day service but she is facing a dilemma these days where she must choose her engagements wisely. She will be very determined to make the Duke of Edinburgh’s Thanksgiving service later this month, which will be of incredible importance to her considering his funeral was so scaled back. “Her Majesty, I believe, is very like her mother, who was reluctant to use a wheelchair, so in her advancing years it’s about projecting herself as much as possible for the big occasions. The Queen tested positive for Covid on February  and Buckingham Palace said at the time she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms”. Last month, she acknowledged her frail condition for the first time during a royal engagement at Windsor Castle. The Queen told visiting military officials: “As you can see, I can’t move.” She last met a group of people in public on February .

Her Majesty is hoping to be able to attend the event with her walking stick at Westminster Abbey on March .But this comes after she was announced not fit enough to attend today’s Commonwealth Service at the same venue.Buckingham Palace did not give a specic reason for her planned absence from the event.It is being reported that her aides said the Queen was so frail she is unable to even walk her beloved corgis.Queen Elizabeth II has owned more than  corgis in her letime but she has not taken her dogs for a walk at Windsor Castle for six months. Now The Mail on Sunday understands she has ruled out the option of using a wheelchair at this stage and remains determined to continue to walk for as long as possible.The Queen, who turns  next month and has recently recovered from Covid, was last week moving around Windsor Castle without a walking stick and is not suffering from a new illness. But she still made the “regretful” decision late on Friday to pull out of the annual Commonwealth Service, which is usually a highlight in her calendar.  A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey.” Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said she believed the Queen would be “determined” to make the Thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey dedicated to her late husband Prince Philip on March . Ms Seward said: “It would have been a huge wrench to miss the Commonwealth Day service but she is facing a dilemma these days where she must choose her engagements wisely.  She will be very determined to make the Duke of Edinburgh’s Thanksgiving service later this month, which will be of incredible importance to her considering his funeral was so scaled back. “Her Majesty, I believe, is very like her mother, who was reluctant to use a wheelchair, so in her advancing years it’s about projecting herself as much as possible for the big occasions. The Queen tested positive for Covid on February  and Buckingham Palace said at the time she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms”.  Last month, she acknowledged her frail condition for the first time during a royal engagement at Windsor Castle. The Queen told visiting military officials: “As you can see, I can’t move.” She last met a group of people in public on February .

Will you be sad to see Harry miss the memorial  Have your say in the comment section He said he would feel unsafe bringing his two children Archie, two, and Lilibet, nine months, over to the UK. Experts previously claimed Harry would have been given aposadequateapos protection for the March  event in Westminster Abbey, and during his stay in Windsor. Harry had said long ago he felt it was not safe to bring his we or children back to the country. Angela Levin, Harry’s biographer, told the Sun: “He has snubbed the Duke of Edinburgh but really he is snubbing the Queen.”  She said the Queen was still grieving the loss of Philip, her husband of  years, and suggested Harry may well use the same reasoning to avoid attending his grandmotheraposs Platinum Jubilee celebration as well. She went on: “He has got this all wrong. If he comes over for a royal event he gets police protection. What they won’t do is,he goes out with his friends he gets security.” Harry has been back to the UK only twice since leaving for the US in  with we Meghan. He ed for Philip’s funeral last April only days after he told Oprah Winfrey of racist comments made by royal family members about his children, without revealing who he was referring to. Two months later he attended an unveiling of a statue of his mother, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace.This comes as Buckingham Palace revealed today that the Queen would not be attending the Commonwealth Service on Monday.Instead, Prince Charles will be attending in her place.

Rosemarie, who asked for her surname to not be shared, moved into her flat in North London just over two years ago now and, within  days, the family had a heavy leak coming down through her kitchen ceiling.However, that was only the beginning of the issues the family was to experience at the Peabody housing association property in Muswell Hill, reports MyLondon. The single mum has also been having problems with the boiler, being left without hot water, and Rosemarie said her kids - aged seven and  - constantly complain about the water being too cold.Peabody housing association has apologised for the issues and says it is working to tackle the issues.  But in the meantime, Rosemarie claims things took a dramatic turn for the worse at the beginning of the year when her sonsapos bedroom was hit by flood damage. She said the damage resulted in them sleeping her in and the mum being forced to sleep on the floor. Rosemarie said: “First, the bathroom radiator wasn’t working. They came and they tried to fix it, but it still just comes on now and again. “The radiator in the kids’ bedroom is constantly leaking as well. With the hot water, when you put your hand under it, it’s warm. But seconds later when you put it on your body, it’s cold.The mum-of-two said the lack of hot water in the property has led to huge issues for the family and her sons struggle to wash properly before going to school. She said it’s extremely upsetting and her kids constantly complain about the water being too cold. Rosemarie also claimed the heating in her North London flat does not work properly. This is a huge issue, as she claims the back door to the property hasn’t been sealed properly, meaning the flat gets cold very quickly.  She added: “There’s such a big gap around it - they tried to patch it up but it didn’t work. I’ve got slugs coming through the gap. According to Rosemarie, the conditions in her flat took a dramatic turn on January , earlier this year when her sons’ bedroom was hit by devastating flood damage. Rosemarie explained that the flood damage “mashed up” everything in the room, including the childrenaposs beds, lights and their possessions.As a result, her two sons have been living without beds ever since and she has given them her bed to sleep in. Now, she has been forced to sleep on the floor. “I had to give up my bed - that room is completely out of use,” Rosemarie said. Rosemarie is a vulnerable tenant, with a long history of depression, anxiety and OCD.  She does not feel Peabody is taking her mental health considerations into account and said her living conditions have pushed her to a new low.

Lynn Siner died aged  at her home on Boxing Day in  after a battle with cancer.The mum, from Huyton, Merseyside was told she had days to live in the October of that year but her daughter Ashleigh believes her mum was determined to spend one last Christmas with the family, reports Liverpool Echo.Lynn had been in Marie Curie Hospice in the weeks leading up to December , , but was allowed home on Christmas Eve to spend the festive period with her family. Ashleigh said it was a special time for her family and her mum also absolutely loved it. She said: My mum was always thinking of others before herself even though she was so ill, and she wanted to try and make Christmas as normal as possible. It was our tradition every year for myself, my mum and my brother to go to London at the beginning of December for the weekend.  My mum loved to go to Harrods and get her special presents from there. Obviously, she was too ill to go but she still wanted me to go and get everyone’s Christmas presents - she was ringing me from her bed at Marie Curie telling me what to buy from Harrods. “While she was staying at Marie Curie, we brought one of her Christmas trees in from home and decorated it and put all the presents we had bought underneath – we wanted her room to feel very homely. “Christmas was such a special time for our family as my mum absolutely loved it and looked forward to it all year. We enjoyed the build-up, doing Christmassy things and visiting the markets. Mum was too ill to go out to the Christmas markets, but Marie Curie had a special Christmas fayre in the hospice with stalls selling all types of things. All my family went along, and we really enjoyed it. It was perfect as it was all indoors, and we could easily push my mum in the wheelchair from her room and into the lt upstairs to visit the stalls.” Ashleigh added that her mum was allowed home on Christmas Eve, which meant the family could spend the night with eachother. We all stayed with mum on Christmas Eve and we opened our presents as normal on Christmas morning, Ashleigh said. After our Christmas lunch, my mum then fell asleep early afternoon and never really woke again apart from saying the odd sentences, and then she then passed away Boxing Day morning. I really do believe she got the strength to make sure she was there for the whole of Christmas Day. We were told in October that she only had days left to live but she fought on and I think once she was home, and saw us all together for one last Christmas, she was ready to go. Even though it was the worst time of our lives, we are so glad we got to spend that last Christmas together, and Marie Curie helped make that possible.” Lynn was a health care assistant at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital and Ashleigh said due to this she trusted the doctors and nurses at Marie Curie and felt safe and secure at the hospice. Since Lynnaposs death, the family have raised raised thousands of pounds for Marie Curie. Ashleigh said: “At the funeral, we asked for donations to Marie Curie rather than flowers and after that, I thought that I’d like to do other things to raise money for the charity to give something back and do something for my mum and the whole family. “So, the first thing that we did was host charity night at a local social club with raffles, Irish Bingo and entertainment. We did a tombola too and got lots of prizes from dferent companies to auction for the raffle - it was amazing. We raised roughly £, from that event. “Then, when we took the money to Marie Curie and learnt about the Pay for a Day fundraising challenge where we could set ourselves the goal of raising enough money to pay to run the hospice for a whole day. So, we jumped at this and got on with planning our next event a charity walk. “It ended up being a fancy dress walk for family and friends mainly, starting at the Albert Dock and ending up at my mum’s house in Dovecot, where we had drinks to celebrate and toast mum. We walked over K and raised more than £,.” “We plan on doing more fundraising for Marie Curie in the future too.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ChristmasBoxing DayHarrods Inc.Love IslandCharitiesFuneralsHospitalsStock marketFancy dressChristmas treesChristmas partyCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Weather forecaster Jim Dale told the Express that Brits can look forward to hot weather arriving fairly early this year. April temperatures in the UK usually reach a daily high of around C and a low of C - but the high this year could reach a scorching C, Daily Star reports.The forecaster said such spikes in temperature are becoming more likely as a result of global warming. He said: I think hot weather could come in fairly early as far as April is concerned perhaps.  I know March is the start of Spring but I think weaposre probably going to get properly into April before we start to see the searing sort of temperatures. I wouldnapost be surprised to see C, C, C in the middle of April. Dale added: Longer-term, given whataposs happening globally in terms of the temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere and whataposs also happening in the United States, I would not be surprisedwe started to see some big highlights - in whichever direction it goes, either cold or hot. It is more likely that we see those spikes of heat at early stages because of global warming. Itaposs too dficult to be certain at this moment, but I would not be surprised to see the summer deliver the same kind of heat stress at times. This comes as the Met Office issued yellow weather warnings for strong winds on Sunday.  Gusts are expected to track up the Irish Sea, and winds may reach  to mph along coastal areas. These are expected to travel northwards throughout Sunday. There is a small chance of winds exceeding mph, possibly reaching severe gales along more exposed coastal regions with winds reaching mph. This may lead to some poor coastal conditions and transport disruption.  UK  day weather forecastToday: Band of rain continuing north and east, becoming slow moving across parts of east and southeast England later. Sunshine and showers, heavy in places with hail and thunder, following across western areas. Gales in western areas easing through the afternoon. Tonight: Rain in east clearing. Showers near southern coasts,  clear spells inland allowing frost and patchy fog to form. Cloudier further north with outbreaks of rain in the northwest. Monday: Outbreaks of rain across the northwest moving east across northern areas and turning more showery. Sunny spells further south, with a few heavy showers developing. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Rain across the far northwest on Tuesday will spread across many areas during Wednesday, before clearing to leave largely dry, fine, and sunny conditions by Thursday.

Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer. “Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely and damage to trees possible. Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and or large waves.” Then more widespread yellow warnings are also in place for Sunday with similar advice to expect travel disruption. BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker warned people that as well as the strong wind people will need their umbrellas.“A lot of cloud and some rain across Scotland, parts of northern England, brighter across the rest of England and Wales, and in fact some decent sunny spells through the middle of the afternoon and I think the best of the weather will be the further east you go, he said, looking at Saturday.  But notice this curl of rain here, this is a low pressure that is swinging into the south west of the UK. Not only rain but some very strong winds, we are talking of gusts of mph, mph and maybe even mph so it is really going to be quite stormy around some of the coasts.” Mr Schafernaker said it is not widespread but advised people in the South West to take care. Then on Sunday the strong winds will cover the country with the weather impacted by a low pressure system by the west of Scotland. Very gusty winds right across the country, we are talking mph, mph or maybe mph around some exposed coasts … on Sunday it will be blustery right across the UK. Temperatures on Sunday typically between C and C so not as mild as it has been but mild enough, said Mr Schafernaker.  Looking ahead to next week and people can expect spring-like temperatures especially in the south. Monday a much better day, the winds will be lighter there will be some sunshine around, still some showers around northern parts of the country but in the south it really is an improving picture and that’s how it is going to be over the next few days into next week, said Mr Schafernaker. In fact in the south of the country temperatures could peak around C or C. So a mixed weekend but better the week ahead.” UK forecast for the next  days Turning wet and windy in the Southwest this afternoon. Today: Sunny spells and showers this morning, with parts of Scotland seeing some more persistent rain. Showers fading for many this afternoon when wet and windy weather with heavy rain coastal gales develops over southwest England and southwest Wales. Tonight: Early evening rain in the southwest moves slowly northeastwards to extend from western Scotland into northwest England, the Midlands and southern England by dawn. Windy, with gales in the west. Sunday: Early rain over parts of Scotland and England clears eastwards, clearing the far east late afternoon. Otherwise, sunny spells and showers. Windy with coastal gales in the north and west. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Occasionally unsettled across northern and western areas, with spells of rain and strong winds. Generally drier where, with some mist and fog overnight, before some rain develops Wednesday.

Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  The lawsuit was first revealed by the Sunday Mirror in November and was formally lodged in Florida last week. Samantha, , is suing her half-sister Meghan for , , claiming she lied about her to the authors of controversial book Finding Freedom and in her TV interview with Oprah Winfrey. Speaking in the debut episode, Thomas says: “I’m standing up for my oldest daughter, Samantha. In this case, she should win because Meghan’s book was full of lies about her. I would appear in a deposition in this case,it came to it.”Michael Kump, representing Meghan, called the lawsuit “baseless and absurd” and a “continuation of a pattern of disturbing behaviour”. He added: “We will give [the lawsuit] the minimum attention necessary, which is all it deserves.” In November, Meghan apologised to the Court of Appeal after emails contradicting a claim she did not collaborate with Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand were disclosed. The messages, revealed by Meghan’s ex-communications secretary Jason Knauf, showed she sent details about Samantha and brother Thomas Jr to pass on for the book. But Meghan insisted: “I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court.”  Speaking about the motivation behind the podcast, Thomas’s co-host Karl, , said: “Tom wants to do it to put his thoughts out there from the horse’s mouth. He wants to speak about how Meghan and Harry have affected his family. The chat will be no-holds-barred. “He wants his truth to be out there, just like Meghan’s truth came out a year ago in her Oprah Winfrey interview.  “He also wants to speak about other things in the news, too.” Karl – an LA-based photographer who grew up in Winchester, Hants – added: “We’re thinking of referring to ourselves as ‘the yapper and the snapper’ in future. It sounds more catchy than Tom and Karl.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleYouTubeRoyal FamilySunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But, who should be expected to pay for a wedding is an entirely dferent debate. Nowadays, most couples tend to pay for their big day themselves, possibly with a little help from family, but back in the day, the tradition was for the brideaposs parents to shoulder most of the cost.However, one bride-to-be has been gaining a lot of negative attention online, after complaining that her future in-laws hadnapost contributed enough to her wedding. The brideaposs parents gted her an incredibly generous £,when they first announced their engagement, while her fianceeaposs parents - who are orced - gave £each. My parents graciously gave me £,as an engagement gt to start planning my wedding. My brother got married last year and received the same, she wrote anonymously in a Facebook group.My fianceaposs parents, who are orced, gave us £each at the engagement. Despite our wedding planning talk they made no voice of a contribution, so my fiance had to ask them directlythey were considering gting money just so we could factor in budgeting. They have come back with  . I know thataposs not nothing but I feel a tad hard done by. I understand everyone is in dferent circumstances but I feel sorry for my fiancee because there is such a large discrepancy. The bride concluded by saying her parents worked hard to set aside a wedding and education fund for herself and her siblings while they were younger, while his parents are currently spending money on holidays instead of his wedding.The post was later shared to Redditaposs Wedding Shaming forum, where people were less than impressed with the womanaposs greed.Iaposve read this a few times and Iaposm still gobsmacked by it. Is your partner   His parents raised him, he is an adult. If his parents want to spend their golden years enjoying le after raising a child for most of their adult le, I think absolutely good on them, one person wrote. If my partner had the same entitled attitudes I wouldnapost be planning a wedding, Iaposll say that much.Another added: Is this a joke  Seriously  I would rather my parents spend £, on a holiday than on my wedding any day! The people who are hard done by are those who canapost afford a wedding at all, those whose parents have died and will never be at their wedding, couples who have their wedding cancelled, people who have lost everything in floods or fire … shall I go on If youaposre genuinely asking for an opinion on this- I think you sound ungrateful and spoiled.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The hauntings reputedly became so frightening Bolton Council was forced to intervene, but staff couldnapost find a rational explanation for what was going on. At one stage an exorcism was carried out, and all paranormal activity on the street is now thought to have ceased. Even so, years after the last ghostly goings-on, one resident was still made to sign a disclaimer form before moving into her home. It all started in  when one family started experiencing bizarre activity. It was said that their toddler would talk to a ‘little man’ in his room and an oil-type substance would run down the walls.  The incidents reportedly baffled maintenance workers who could not determine the cause of the issues. The family eventually contacted a local church and an exorcism was carried out at the address. Following the ritual, the street fell quiet. But, just five years later in , a flurry of supernatural activity would begin again. Just two doors down from the original haunted house, a family started experiencing strange disturbances. They had not long moved into the address when the unexplained activity began. Laura was -years-old when she moved into the property. The now -year-old said she aposknewapos something was wrong with the home as soon as the family arrived.  Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, she said: “I begged my mum not to move in. “I didn’t like the feel of it. I didn’t feel comfortable but when we got our stuff in, it faded a bit. “When things started happening, my mum would say it was the ghost of my granddad. But I said it wasn’t. “I just knew there was something there. It felt like I was walking into someone’s personal space. “I didn’t want to walk through the door.” Laura remembers the first supernatural occurrence like it was yesterday. She was with her older brother and a friend when the incident happened. The siblings decided to play a prank on their pal who was sleeping in the living room.  As they ran back upstairs, her brother let out a blood-curdling scream. He had cut his foot open on a picture frame that was standing on the staircase. It had been hanging on the wall just moments before and had not fallen down. “We had literally just walked on the stairs andit fell it wouldn’t stand up,” Laura continued. “If he stood on it, it would have slipped. It was like a force was holding it in place. “That was one of the first scary things that happened.” Laura also recalls the time her brother’s girlfriend came round to stay. She woke in the middle of the night to find her standing in her room, staring at her as she slept. Laura ignored her and went back to sleep.  The following morning, she told her mother about the strange occurrence. Thinking nothing of it, Laura ed to her bedroom. But her mother called her downstairs just  minutes later, where she found her brother’s girlfriend “looking at her weirdly”. “She said I did the exact same thing to her,” she continued. “We got up at dferent times.” Strange activity wouldn’t just occur inside the home. Dozens of dead crows were once found scattered around the front and back garden, including along the ginnel at the side of the property. Laura said the sight traumatised her so badly she blocked it out of her mind. And then there was the baby oil-type substance, similar to that found in the original haunted house. Laura remembers it dripping down her bedroom walls, causing her posters to fall down. A foul, sulphur smell likened to rotting eggs would also fill the property. Laura says some council maintenance workers even refused to visit the address due to its reputation. “My nephew used to speak to someone and called them ‘Big Guy’,” she continued. “He would sit there in the corner of the room babbling away. “When asked who he was talking to, he would say Big Guy. “He kept doing it in the same place and would point right up to the corner.” Laura also recalls the time she heard an entity imitate her brother. She was at home with a friend waiting for her sibling tofrom work. They were ready to watch a new episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a show her brother didn’t want to miss out on. She heard the door open, a set of keys placed on the hook and footsteps into the kitchen. When her brother still hadn’t come upstairs  minutes later, she thought he may have been making food. But suddenly, her brother walked through the door. Laura said: “As I got to the top of the stairs, I saw him. “I asked himhe had just gone back out. “He said he had literally just got home and his taxi was driving off. “I ran downstairs and said someone was in the house. But no one was in the kitchen and the keys were still in the door. “We heard it it was really clear. We knew the sound of it.” Laura eventually moved out of the home when she was -years-old. And although she hasn’t experienced anything paranormal since, what occurred on Wingates Grove continues to haunt her to do this day. “I donapost watch any scary films or anything to do with ghosts,” Laura added. “I’ve suffered with anxiety since to the point where the whole thing about the street is on my doctor’s note. “The last five months we lived there I slept in a bed with my mum and dad because I was that scared. “That’s when things got really bad. “I kept seeing people stood at the door. I fell asleep facing my wall because I was terried of turning over. “If I needed to go to the toilet in the night, I would hold it in.” These days, there are no reports of ghostly activity on the street. Caron Walton, who now lives in Lauraaposs childhood home, says she has ’no problem’ with the property’s history – and actually enjoys its quirky past. She purchased the home in  and says she had to sign a disclaimer before she moved into the address. It specied that she was not allowed to use a Ouija board or perform any other type of black magic at the address, she says. She was also told she was not allowed to move into the homeshe had young children, she told the M.E.N. “I understand there was something going on there,” she said. “It used to jump from there, to the house next door to here. “I had to sign a disclaimer saying I wouldn’t use a Ouija board or do black magic or anything dark. “They wanted me to sign a slip of paper. I quite liked it. “I’ve heard tales that there’s meant to be an old man walking around on the landing, but we’re quite happy here. “I think it’s quite novel I quite like it. It’s a selling point for me.” Caron hasnapost experienced any supernatural activity since moving into the address. “They wanted someone to move here who didn’t have very young children. “I’ve had no issues I thought it was quite quirky. “A lot of council workers wouldnapost come here. I’ve not felt anything since living here. “I’ve had pets, like dogs, and they’ve never been freaked out. “I’m open to it I’m not a disbeliever. I’ll believe it when I see it.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON VampiresGhosts\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The woman initially replied to her date to state she would make that decision tomorrow, but the man wasnapost happy with her answer and doubled down on his stance. He said: Nah. Iaposm not going to be in the mix and you pick. Itaposs either see how it is with just me first or itaposs not. I am too tired to compete. And I donapost care to have the aposwho needs who financiallyapos [talk]. Iaposm not woke or care to be, to be honest. The woman also shared further screenshots in the comments which exposed more of the manaposs strange behaviour - as he messaged her again at : am to asksheaposd had time to think about his exclusivity demands. He wrote: Good morning. Howaposs it going  Do you want to meet today   What do you feel about me the situation  And in another post, the woman revealed she and her date had another conversation about what he wants from a relationship, where he admitted he doesnapost want to compete with others. He said: I like only being with one person. Iaposm not talking to others. I want to meet somebody and be with them. I donapost like competing or having somebody  dating around. Commenters on the Twitter post were split, as while some thought the manaposs demands were red flags, others praised him for being honest about what he wanted out of his dating experience. One person said: All I ever see are bullets dodged whenever somebody posts anything from online dating. As another added: Wow, you need at least six people to neatly unfold that red flag. But someone  disagreed, stating: Frankly, this is a good attitude. Heaposs being honest, showing his hand and you know to run.

Sharing her story anonymously, the woman explained she first became suspicious of her spouse when he started coming home much later than usual and would leave the house in the middle of the night. And after confronting him and getting no answers, the woman decided to buy an Apple AirTag, which is a tracking device that connects to the Find My app on an iPhone and is most commonly used to help you track down your keys or walletyouaposve misplaced them.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The woman then snuck the AirTag into the glovebox of her husbandaposs car and waited for him to sneak out of the house so that she could monitor where he went. She wrote: My husband and I have been together for  years and married for two. We don’t have any children yet but we have been trying. He works for a construction company while I work from home as a wellness brand owner and vlogger. Over the past couple of months, he has been staying at work a lot later than usual. At first, I didn’t suspect any wrongdoing and just brushed it off. He has worked nights before, just never this often. However, last week I woke up at  am and he wasn’t in bed. I went back to sleep and asked him about it in the morning and he explained that he went for a run. At  in the morning  Weird but I brushed it off.  Then he did it again a few nights later, except this time I heard his car pull up in the driveway. When he came back into our bedroom I pretended to be asleep. The next morning, while he was at work, I bought an Apple AirTag to track his whereabouts. When he got home from work, late might I add, I placed the AirTag in the glovebox of his car. I stayed up all night anticipating him sneaking out again and lo and behold he did! I tracked his car and saw it go to an abandoned plot of land a whole -minute drive away. He stayed there for almost two hours and then came home. The woman spoke to her husband when he came home, and while she demanded to know what heaposd been up to, the man was furious that she had invaded his privacy.  She added: I confronted him about it and he got absolutely furious. I asked him why he was going there and he said that he was aposhandling his businessapos and I should aposmind mineapos and aposrespect his privacyapos. He packed a bag and has now been staying at his brother’s house for the last couple of nights. Reddit commenters have been split over the post, as many people believe both the woman and her husband are in the wrong for their actions - with several insisting communication could have solved most of their issues. One person said: Everybody sucks here. Him for the lying and sneaking around, you for the tracking device. When you get to the point of putting a tracking device on your spouseaposs car, itaposs time to either go to marriage counselling or a lawyer for a orce. While another added: If heaposs disappearing off at weird times you should be told where heaposs been. However, tracking someone is a**hole behaviour as well, youaposre both as bad in this scenario. He sucks for his lack of honesty, this sounds like some sort of shady deal to me. You suck for putting a tracker on him, thataposs disgusting behaviour also, a third stated. Appleaposs AirTags can be helpfulyouaposve misplaced your keys, but you shouldnapost worry about someone slipping one into your bag for malicious purposes, as according to Appleaposs website, the device is designed to discourage unwanted tracking. If someone aposs AirTag finds its way into your belongings, your iPhone will send you an alert to let you know itaposs travelling with you. Andyou canapost find the device, it will start playing a sound to help you locate it. However, this feature only kicks inan AirTag is separated from its owner, so you also donapost need to worryyouaposre travelling with a friend who has an AirTag.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditUmm what MarriageCheating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Toddlers sit compliantly, cajoled by carers doing their best to maintain some calm amid the madness.The sad scene in Kyiv is echoed in  children’s homes housing , orphans, half of them disabled. Food and water is running out. Staff numbers are hit as , seek sanctuary with their own families. Carers say they rush the kids to safety below ground by announcing “Children – explosions”. They also tell them to eat every scrap on their plates – unable to guarantee when the next meal will be. Just , orphans have been evacuated – with the British charity Hope and Homes for Children helping  to safety in Dnipro and Vorzel. Relentless shelling means it is too perilous to move the youngsters in the picture above. Today, the Sunday Mirror launches an urgent Orphan Appeal to send out supplies. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Labour leader Keir Starmer, ex-forces chief Lord Dannatt and Bond actress Olga Kurylenko – who has Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian ancestry – are backing our campaign. shockHope and Homes rescued  children, including two babies and two with disabilities, from Dnipro, in central Ukraine. Another  from Vorzel, near the capital, were bussed away when their orphanage was hit by an illegal Russian cluster bomb. Mercully there were no casualties. In Dnipro, Hope and Home aide Daria, , explained how the horror unfolded there. She said: “When the first rockets fell it was a massive shock. We said, ‘Children, today your le changes. Rockets could fly in at any moment, soldiers could walk through the door’. “We started to very quickly instruct them how we should go down to the basement during an air raid. “We told them, ‘A war has begun, we must be nice to each other, we shouldn’t argue’. We told them make sure you finish every morsel because we don’t know when the next delivery of food will come. Even now we can’t tell them when they’ll next eat.“On the third night we heard bombs nearby. I walk into the dorm and say ‘children, explosions’ and they quickly and orderly go to the basement.Sasha, who is , said ‘I worry Putin will fire a nuclear bomb – he will destroy the world’. They dream the war will end, that they can go to summer camp, to school, on holiday.”Ukraine has the most orphans in Europe and , were already in care. But each day more need help as war claims the lives of their parents. Daria went on: “We are trying to offer humanitarian support to children from places like Izyum and Kharkiv that don’t have parents because of the war. “Our aim is that no child goes hungry. Countless children have been evacuated from the areas of the worst fighting. We try to find foster families.”  In Kyiv, Hope and Home’s local director Halyna has managed to relocate some children. Halyna is separated from her family and is terried for her -year-old mother in eastern Ukraine, where Russian troops are massing.She told us: “Orphanages, boarding schools, baby homes and hospitals are being bombed. I’m used to the sound of constant explosions and sirens.“The bridges have been blown up near my home to prevent any tanks crossing, so it’s dficult to help everyone we would want. But we expect many evacuees in Donetsk and Lugansk and Kharkiv city to need our support in the coming days. Most children won’t be able to be evacuated as it’s too unsafe. “And I’m worried the few who can be got out are not being monitored properly while moving over borders. They’re disappearing. Some are even being taken overseas. “We could be looking for children like them all over the world for many years to come.”  Charity CEO Mark Waddington, , – a veteran of similar work in Afghanistan and Iraq – is directing operations from the Ukraine-Moldova border. Mark, from Bakewell, Derbys, said: “There’s no central tracking system to know which children are where. They are going missing.” And that, says Hope and Homes, puts them at risk of beatings, rape, torture and trafficking. Worried Mark added: “Many children have some sort of family in Ukraine. The key is to keep them close because the further they go, the more dislocated they become from those families. “My big worry is the unaccompanied children, who will have fewer resources. Some will be destitute.” That is why the Sunday Mirror has teamed up with the charity to help – with details of how you can donate displayed above. There is urgent need for le-saving aid packs of food, water, clothes, medicine, pillows, sleeping bags, torches – even tape for windows to stop shattering glass causing harm. The charity has been working in Ukraine for  years and is dedicated to getting children into loving homes with extended family or foster parents.  Patrons include Bond girl Olga, , who said: “These children are stranded without staff, food and water while under attack from bombs and bullets. I struggle to comprehend the suffering of millions of families, including my own, caught up in this war. So imagine the suffering of children who are totally alone.” Former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Dannatt is a patron too and has been associated with the charity for  years. He said: “Children are being left behind in the war zone to live feral in bombed-out orphanages. “I’ve seen refugee children separated from family and thrown into dangerous orphanages in foreign lands. We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Ukraine. Children belong in families.”  Aid workers are working in hellish conditions to save as many children as they can. A Polish charity has taken in , children, while a mission in Donetsk saw  led to safety. And Londoner Jeremy Posen, , was dubbed the “Angel of Odesa” and likened to a “British Schindler” after helping to lead , Jewish refugees – including  orphans – to safety. Jeremy is chief financial officer for the charity Tikva, which cares for homeless, abandoned and abused Jewish children.

Slavinsky claimed that “restrictive” political and economic sanctions from the West allowed the court to refuse infringement claims brought forward by Entertainment One UK Ltd.  The court ruling links the Peppa Pig and Daddy Pig infringement claim to unfriendly actions of the United States of America and affiliated foreign countries”, according to legal documents from the Kirov case. Sanctions against Russia allow the court not to protect the UK company’s trademark rights, said the judge amid suspicion the case has been seized on by the authorities in Moscow as a weapon against Western sanctions. Entertainment Oneaposs case in sleepy Kirov -  miles northeast of Moscow - had claimed an abuse of right”.  The obscure case was brought against Ivan Kozhevnikov, an entrepreneur, to protect trademark rights for drawings of the beloved childrenaposs cartoon characters. At the hearing, the judge appeared well-versed in the nuances of the latest sanctions developments. The British company can appeal the bizarre ruling against its claim for around £ in compensation for unlawful copying of its images. By the time the case was heard, the value of the claim had sunk to £ due to the plummeting of Putin’s rouble currency caused by the war in Ukraine.The ruling is seen as revenge for Western patent authorities severing their ties with Russia due to the Ukrainian crisis. The company had previously enjoyed success in Russia over its claims.  The Kirov case is one of multiple Peppa and Daddy Pig infringement cases filed in Russia from Britain including several in Siberia.The Russians could have been aware of Boris Johnson ’s admiration for Peppa Pig after his bizarre November speech to the Confederation of British Industry.Referring to a theme park in Hampshire, he told surprised business executives: Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World…  “I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place: it has very safe streets, discipline in schools.”He went on, after losing his place in his speech: Who would have believed that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly a Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC, would now be exported to  countries with theme parks both in America and China ”The ruling could trigger more widespread abuse of trademarks as was common in Russia in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union in .

Now experts want the Government to hit their family members too. They say a loophole in our laws means oligarchs could transfer assets to their children to potentially dodge the sanctions. “There is a major gap in the sanctions regime and it must be addressed quickly, says Dr Susan Hawley, executive director of the Spotlight on Corruption charity. Boris Johnson has vowed there will be no “safe haven” here for wealthy Russians who have supported Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here But while US authorities have sanctioned close family of the despot’s allies, the UK has been lenient. Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a lecturer in Sociology and Policy at Birmingham’s Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, said: “UK sanctions definitely need to be tougher. “If they don’t cover the children of Putin’s allies, it’s pointless.  “They could just sign money over to their children. Perhaps they have already done that. “It’s dficult to trace a lot of Russian money because it is often held in the names of relatives – and some of the money will be parked offshore.” Here we take a look at the wealth and lestyles of some of some of Putin’s cronies and their families. Sergey Naryshkin  Heaposs director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. Despite the Kremlin claiming it has invaded Ukraine to rid Europe of Nazism, Naryshkin has posed with French far right leader Marine Le Pen, who claims they meet once a year.He was sanctioned by both the US and the EU in  over Russia ’s annexation of Crimea but UK authorities didn’t impose restrictions on him until .His daughter Veronika is a model and the coach of the Russian national swimming team.Her Instagram shows her posing next to the Efel Tower in Paris and in ious locations in Italy. She has not been sanctioned.Naryshkin had a tense exchange with Putin during a security meeting about Ukraine. He was repeatedly interrupted and told to “speak plainly” as he squirmed under Putin’s gaze. Nikolai Patrushev  Secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, Patrushev has been subject to sanctions in the UK since . Restrictions were placed on the -year-old for “shaping policy of the Russian Government threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”. His son Andrei – a banker and a key player in Russia’s energy industry – has recently been sanctioned by the US but has escaped similar punishment on this side of the Atlantic. He has had leadership roles with Gazprom – an energy giant now sanctioned in the UK.The Foreign Office did not respond directly as to why wider families of oligarchs are not sanctioned. Instead, they released a statement from Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. It said: “We’re targeting those complicit in Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and those who support this barbaric war.”Sergei Shoigu, defence minister  Shoigu, , is so close to Putin that he goes on hunting and fishing trips with him – and is tipped as a potential successor. He has said the West’s “strategic direction continues to pose the biggest threat to Russia’s military security”. He has been sanctioned by the US and EU but the UK has yet to take action against Shoigu or his eldest daughter Yulia, , who is also a politician. His other daughter Ksenia,  – reportedly a millionaire in her own right – is also absent from the UK “sanctions list” – people of interest to the British government.  Yet until last year, she was a managing partner of a venture capital fund whose parent company Sistema in  invested in UK articial intelligence companies – FiveAI, SenSat and KisanHub. Before joining Sistema, Ksenia worked in a senior role with Gazprombank, which makes millions selling energy to the West. Ksenia also escaped EU and US sanctions last month. She is a fan of lavish European holidays. Her fitness blogger boyfriend Alexey Stolyarov whisked her off to Italy last year after she had a baby daughter Sergey Lavrov, foreign minister  Lavrov,  – who accused the UK of staging the Salisbury poisonings – was sanctioned by the Government last month. His mistress’s daughter Polina Kovaleva owns a Kensington flat she bought for £.million when just . Now , she does not appear to have an obvious source of income, despite regular foreign holidays. She is the director of two active UK companies - real estate firm PPK Investments and Hotbox Holdings, which manages restaurants. Lavrov, who worked as a Russian envoy to the UN, lived in the USA for  years and also has daughter Ekaterina, , by we Maria. She moved to London and is married to a Cambridge graduate who now owns  restaurants across Russia. Viktor Zolotov  Director of the National Guard of Russia and Putin’s ex-bodyguard, Viktor Zolotov has been sanctioned by almost every major Western democracy except the UK. The US targeted him in , over controversies, including Russia’s annexation of Crimea and his support for Syrian president Bashar-al-Assad.  Further sanctions were imposed by Washington last month over the invasion of Ukraine. Australia took similar measures. He was already facing sanctions in the EU for threatening opposition leader Alexei Navalny with violence in . Boris and Arkady Rotenberg  These brothers, members of Russia’s richest family, are childhood friends of Putin. They are both subject to UK sanctions but much of the luxury property here linked to their family is believed to have been bought by offshore trusts. Arkady, who founded the SMP bank and is Putin’s judo partner, was first sanctioned by the UK over links to a PR campaign allegedly designed to brainwash children in annexed Crimea into thinking they were Russian. The -year-old tycoon is believed to be involved in a court battle over the £million Surrey mansion where ex-we Natalia, , lives. Arkady’s son Igor has also been sanctioned in the UK for “close familial ties” to Putin, but his other adult children Pavel and Liliya are not on the list. Younger brother Boris, , was sanctioned in the UK last month. US authorities have also sanctioned his we Karina and sons Roman and Boris but none of the family have faced similar measures in the UK. Roman, , has British citizenship and lives in a London home worth around £million Igor Shuvalov, former deputy PM  The politician and key Putin pal is chairman of Russian state bank VEB.RF. He owns a reported £million worth of luxury London property. He was sanctioned by the Government last week. But unlike the US, British officials have failed to impose similar restrictions on his family despite evidence of some having had business ties to London. Britain does not sanction unless officials believe a person is of interest to the government. His daughter Maria, , a dancer with the worldfamous Bolshoi Ballet, has had ties here. Her social media is awash with snaps from luxury holidays in European resorts.  At , she was listed as the majority shareholder in a firm based in Mayfair called Regional Property Developments Ltd, before it was dissolved in . Her brother Evegeny, , owned the largest stake until . Their property magnate mum Olga has also escaped sanctions. In , she flew to the UK on a private jet to exhibit corgis at a Windsor dog show– because her pets were said to find first class “too uncomfortable” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir PutinRussia Ukraine warSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Friday, it was reported that the commander of the Eastern Military District, Andrei Kolesnikov, had died. This came within days of his colleagues Vitaly Gerasimov of the st Army and Andrei Sukhovetsky of the Russian Airborne Forces also being killed in combat. The former RAF commander told Sky News: Critical reports that three Major Generals – Major Generals donapost normally get that close to the front. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere If they do, something is going very badly wrong. It shows Russia is stretched to its elastic limit in Ukraine. And to try and salvage something from this, the generals are at the front whipping the troops for one last effort. If youaposve lost three generals, and youaposre claiming youaposve only lost about  troops, something doesnapost add up and it suggests things are not going well militarily. Whilst reports y, Moscow has only killed around  Ukrainian soldiers so far - but lost more than , of its own troops. This means Russia is losing more troops every day - at least  a day. Western intelligence reported that Russia was taken back by the fierceness of Ukraine’s resistance which has seen it lose more tanks than Germany has across its total army.  The cities of Kherson, in eastern Ukraine, and Melitopol, in the south, are the only large centres to have been officially taken by the Russians. Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol have been subjected to heavy, relentless shelling, forcing countless to flee, but they have not fallen yet. Russians are thought to have around  major generals in theatre in Ukraine. Western officials believe having such high-ranking officers so far forward to the front in the early stages of the invasion is signicant.  There have been widespread reports of morale among Russian troops is low after two weeks of the war, with footage emerging of allegedly captured soldiers claiming they were not aware they would be deployed to fight. General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the th Combined Arms Army, was killed in fighting yesterday. His death followed the killings of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the st Army, who died outside Kharkiv alongside senior officers, and Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky. Sukhovetsky was the first general to die and was reportedly killed by a sniper. Putin confirmed his death in a speech eight days into the invasion. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On March , Ukraine claimed to have killed , Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than  civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least  people have been killed, including  children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. It comes as Ukraineaposs President accused Russia of aposstate terrorismapos on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.  Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Sukhovetsky had reportedly been decorated for his role in annexing Crimea and Russian paper Pravda and graduated from Airborne Command School in . The second general to die was Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, who also died this week. Ukraineaposs defence ministry said that Gerasimov was killed outside the eastern city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers. The ministry also broadcasted what it said was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing the generalaposs death and complaining that their secure communications were no longer ing inside Ukraine.

It comes as scientists in Ukraine have been told to destroy all high-threat lab diseases.Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former chief of the British Armyaposs chemical weapons unit, said Russian troops could storm a lab and use it as a base to unleash a bioweapon. He also warned Putinaposs indiscriminate bombing campaign could hit a lab.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here The World Health Organisation has said the most deadly pathogens in Ukraineaposs labs should be wiped out amid fears of potential spills caused by Putinaposs relentless bombing.Russian forces have already seized control of Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia - two of the largest nuclear power plants in Ukraine.It is thought there are more than , labs in Ukraine and although they do not have a level-four lab, which handles the worldaposs most dangerous pathogens - two do have clearance to work with high-level pathogens. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog  The level-three lab works with coronaviruses, tuberculosis, yellow fever, SARS, West Nile, and some strains of influenza. One of the two labs is in Odessa and the other is in Kyiv. Colonel de Bretton-Gordon said Putin could unleash a bioweapon more lethal than Covid.He told The Sun Online : The Russians could use a Ukrainian lab to release a bioweapon. It would be ideal - they could blame the US and Ukraine for the release of the pathogen. The chance to go into a lab would be gold dust for the Russians. They could use it in their own disinformation campaign - they would use it for propaganda. If Putin succeded in blaming the US it could be used as a justication to escalate his war effort. Mr Bretton-Gordon also said that the reckless bombing by the Russians could spark a lab accident.  He added: If a massive bomb hit the lab, the pathogens could be released - but itaposs more likely they would be destroyed.It comes as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has warned Russia might use chemical weapons following its invasion of Ukraine.In recent days, we have heard absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories, Stoltenberg was quoted by Welt am Sonntag as saying, adding that the Kremlin was inventing  pretexts to justy what could not be justied.  Now that these  claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime, Stoltenberg was quoted as saying. He added that although the Ukrainian people were resisting the Russian invasion with courage, the coming days are likely to bring even greater hardship.

That would include killing him although it is not likely to be viable or desirable.” He believes the Russian president should at least face war crimes charges.“The best thing would be to see Putin deposed, arrested and tried, either in Russia or at the International Criminal Court,” he said.“But those options are highly unlikely ever to happen.” The retired Army officer said that while an assassination might be unacceptable to many people it also may be the only way to end the war and prevent future conflicts.He added: “If it came to assassination that might be unpalatable to many but his le has no greater value than the lives of the thousands he has already murdered in Ukraine and where and may well kill in the future.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  He is the ‘Supreme Commander in Chief’ of the Russian forces who ordered an illegal war of aggression and is a legitimate target. Our government planned the assassination of Adolf Hitler in the Second World War. Had he been removed instead of appeased in the late s we would not have suffered a conflict that killed  million people.Osama Bin Laden, Islamic State chief Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi and Iranian Republican Guard Commander Qasem Soleimani all represented direct threats to the West. They were all killed to counter those threats. Putin represents a permanent and deadly threat that will remain while he is in power. “Our priority should be to help remove him.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match.

We are on our own.A group of survivors is being taken to a safe zone on the Isle of Skye # but their bus has broken down en route to the Misty Isle, just north of Fort William.And a huge group of zombies is just  minutes away.But there may be hope. The group has found a zombie-proof shelter # but with room for just six of the group of . The shelter has medical supplies, fresh water and food.Now comes the decision # who will shelter in safety and who will be left to fend for themselves in the zombie-infested wilderness The clock is ticking and the undead are almost upon them.Among the group members are Lorraine, a young paralympic swimmer a -year-old boy raised in care called Grant Taylor, a -year-old geography teacher fond of cooking Michelle, a -year-old dancer and runner Rebecca, aged  and unemployed but multilingual A Scout named Imran, aged  Nic, a rock-climbing medical student in their s Caroline, a -year-old student nurse unable to drive and Joe, a -year-old air cadet qualied to fly and handy with mechanics.The debate raged over their ious merits. Would a rock climber be an asset  Medical experience would be handy, but would we be better with someone who can repair things  Taylor#s geography and cooking skills might be useful, but would these skills be better applied outside or inside the shelter A Scout might better survive outdoors than someone with a physical disability. Where, indeed, does compassion fit where survival is at stake Some offered to be left outside, while others were desperate to be in the shelter, stretching the truth as they did so.Then, with the zombies fast-approaching, another layer of information was revealed about each member.Paralympian Lorraine, in fact, is a wheelchair user. Nic, the rock-climbing medic, has a history of depression and is transgender . Imran is a tourist with English as a second language. Grant, it turned out, is an electrical whiz with a history of an eating disorder. Another was asthmatic others had anxiety issues.Geography teacher Taylor, assumed to be a man, was in fact, female and four months pregnant.Discussions turned to the strengths arising from the ious conditions experienced by group members, a fascinating take on the exercise.

does plan to bring these sites back in to community use and will consult on that in the very near future.That will be consistent with what we did when we demolished properties in central Campbeltown

direction of travel of regeneration in central Campbeltown over the last  years and we believe that our proposal for Dalintober and our consultation for Saddell Street and Queen Street will take that forward.My we and I have recently received from the pension service a note of our increase in the state pension from April  .The increase is . per cent whilst, by that time, inflation is expected to

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

after public consultation.He said: “The Scottish Government has to realise the ambitions of local authorities like East Lothian to moving people around our county.\"Look at the number of electric car charging points we have around the county  We would like to see that replicated with ebikes as well.”Changes which were introduced as part of the project and which will become permanent after cabinet unanimously supported them were new cycle parking areas at beach car parks and other attractions, the re-timing of pedestrian crossings to stop crowds gathering, and new speed limits.They also agreed to make a segregated footpath created between Cockenzie and Prestonpans permanent, along with a widened footpath at Countess Road, Dunbar, and a new path at Hallhill, Dunbar, and the ebike hire scheme, when possible.And they backed making mph zones introduced during Spaces for People permanent.Councillor Norman Hampshire, council leader, said that the Spaces for People changes were made during the pandemic to give people space to move around safely in their towns.He said: “I think the interventions which are in place are the right interventions.”"},{"url":null,"title":"supervision-tranent-man-burst-home-uninvited","story":"David Thomson, , burst into the home uninvited at Morrison Avenue and shouted and swore at the

their community either by providing access and opportunities for others, or by influencing change in education for their communities”.The work of the apprentices caught the eye of Douglas Ross MSP, Scottish Conservative leader, and also Craig Hoy, South Scotland MSP, who visited them last month.The pair thanked the apprentices for their work in transforming derelict space to the rear of Dunbar High Street into an education, heritage and horticultural centre for residents to enjoy and learn from.Mr Ross, who is also an MP, said: “This project is a fantastic example of community working in action.Those involved in helping to transform this area should be extremely proud of all the work that they have carried out.”The apprentices have conducted restorative work on some of the town’s oldest buildings, providing residents with the opportunity to explore first-hand Dunbar’s architectural heritage and history.The group is in the process of renovating a time capsule flat in Dunbar

He said: “All that the apprentices have been doing has improved the lives of people from the local community, as well as developing key skills.“In addition to providing fantastic learning opportunities for people of all ages, the apprentices have helped to give people an insight into the town’s heritage and provided a space for people to reflect at The Ridge’s dementia-friendly Sanctuary Garden.”Kate Darrah, founder and managing director of The Ridge, said: “We are so proud of the achievements of our apprentice team.“In the process, they are building their own skills and making a start on a really satisfying, high-quality craft career.“Many of these youngsters struggled in school and have amazed themselves with their stunning success in a practical setting.“Their skills are now contributing something wonderful to the wider community, which will endure for many years to come, and which provides an additional layer to our shared sense of pride in these hard-working and talented iniduals.”"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1997-1972-1922","story":"‘SCHOOL slammed by inspectors’ was front page news in the East Lothian Courier on March , .A major shake-up of the running of Knox Academy has been called for after a visit by Schools Inspectors who made swingeing criticisms and said teaching ied from very good to unsatisfactory.Setting out an action plan for change, they said the morale of some teachers was low and staff generally felt distanced from the senior management team.“A lack of whole-school direction had led to teachers having inconsistent expectations of pupils on important matters such as attendance, discipline and standards of attainment,” their report revealed.“Overall a firm lead was required from senior management to develop a common sense of purpose among staff and pupils.”Some parents questioned by the inspectors said they did not find head-teacher Anthony B.

Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/13510918.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"wordle-262-todays-wordle-word-8-march-hints-answer","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter S and ends with the letter T.It contains two of the same letter.It is a word to describe a pleasant, not bitter taste. If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

That’s what we’re about. The boys work incredibly hard for each other and have licence to make those raids and go for the big plays. “I thought Ali was absolutely outstanding for the whole time he was on the field. He was a livewire and kept the carrot in front of the donkey in terms of his kicking game. He asked a lot of questions of the Italian defence with his running game as well. “For him to win his th cap, I’m incredibly proud of him and to put in a performance like that was absolutely tremendous and I’m really, really pleased for Ali.” Hogg added that he was quietly pleased with his own performance after a tough couple of weeks when he has struggled to hit his own high standards and has been – perhaps unfairly – castigated for it in the press and on social media. “I just wanted to go out there and express myself and do a job for the team,” he reflected. “A lot has been said about my inidual performances of late but it doesnt really bother me. Im just working hard to make sure I contribute towards a team victory. “We wanted to come out here and give a true reflection of ourselves and make sure we gave a professional performance,” he added. “For large parts of that game, we did exactly that but unfortunately we had a lapse in concentration every now and then that resulted in Italy scoring points, which were quite frustrated about. But, on the whole, it was pleasing to come away with a victory.” Despite Scotland struggling to click as an attacking force for much of the match, they did manage to score five well-taken tries away from, which is a commendable achievement in any international match – although Hogg acknowledged that his team will have to work harder for their points next weekend against Ireland. “It gives us confidence that we can score tries from anywhere, but we scored on the back of counter-attack and quick ball, and it was only really Darcy Graham’s try that went through multi-phase,” he reflected. “Ideally, we’d like to be in a position to go through multi-phase and have a bit more of a clinical edge, but we were put under pressure at times.  “We talked a lot about doing the simple things well but we were off our feet at the ruck a few times and there were a few jackal turnovers against us. These are things we want to tighten up on and be squeaky clean, because that would allow us to get more momentum and really get into our multi-phase attack. “We knew what their defensive triggers were going to be and fortunately we managed to pick up on those and really exploit them,” he added. “We talked about relieving pressure and applying as much pressure to the Italian side as we possibly could through our kicking game and a couple of the tries were built on the back of doing that, creating counter-attack ball.  “That’s where we got our change from and we’re very pleased. But we demand a lot more from ourselves and try to keep teams down to as few points as we possibly can. Italy got back into it and put us under pressure and there are a couple of things we’ll look back at where we let ourselves down slightly. But overall, [we’re] very pleased.” Meanwhile, winger Kyle Steyn explained that while a sharp attack will be key in Dublin next weekend, defence will be keythe team are to secure a famous victory. ‘We’ll back ourselves to take chances when they arise, but the biggest thing is we’ll be fronting up on is D,” he said. “We’ll be ready to go there and front up.” "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9549044.jpg?type=article-full","title":"faslane-home-trident-symbol-humanitys-folly","story":"Each warhead is said to be eight times as destructive as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in , which killed over , civilians.

The House of Commons backed it, though only one Scottish MP voted in favour. Then, just last year, Boris Johnson announced a lt on the cap on the the number of Trident nuclear warheads it can stockpile by more than  percent by the middle of this decade. This ended thirty years of gradual disarmament.UN Elder Mary Robinsons view on this was clear, “While the UK cites increased security threats as justication for this move, the appropriate response to these challenges should be to work multilaterally to strengthen international arms control agreements and to reduce - not increase - the number of nuclear weapons in existence.\"We are now in another chilling moment. Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine, his threats of \"consequences you have never seen\", have meant that the word nuclear is on our lips again. The threat, which not long ago had seemed half-forgotten, a childhood nightmare demoted down the current list of existential threats, was there again: \"the nuclear option\". Might the Russian leader be mad and power-hungry enough to use it Ian Blackford recently confirmed the continuing support of SNP for getting rid of Trident, saying, \"The idea that having nuclear weapons provides a deterrence that removes that threat is far-fetched, to say the least.\"Nuclear weapons are often described as a deterrent. But do they really deter  That they have \"kept the peace\" is just a story, \"a myth\", not backed by evidence of cause and effect, as New York Times writer Ward Wilson has put it. He observed, \"We don’t accept proof by absence in any circumstance where there is real risk.\"Above all Faslane is a reminder of the ridiculous nuclear arsenal the world has built. We may have already clambered down from the global peak stockpile of nuclear weapons which existed in , but there is a long way to go. Approximately , nuclear warheads exist worldwide and almost  percent of them belong to two countries: the United States and Russia. There are more than enough,such maths made any sense, to kill every human on the planet, one hundred times over.That fact, and Putins terrying recent posturings, should be a reminder that global nuclear disarmament must remain a key goal of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

However, no advice is sought on the merits of otherwise of that approach.\"Ten years ago transport minister Keith Brown said \"no compelling case\" had been made that \"tendering inidual routes or unbundling the current contract\" would lead to greater benefits.At that time, there was concern that it would hive off CalMac’s four busiest routes, as suggested in a  consultation on future ferry services.Despite the Ernst and Young Project Neptune remit, the First Minister has ruled out privatising leline ferry services to Scotland’s island communities and said there are no plans to split up the CalMac network.Ms Clark, the West Scotland MSP has raised questions over asking for the Ernst and Young analysis which is supposed to look into unbundling - when Nicola Sturgeon has said there were no plans to do so.In a letter to the First Minister she said: \"I hope you appreciate the decision to commission private consultants to consider this option has caused considerable alarm among trade unions, amongst others, including the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers which received direct assurances in  that the Scottish Government would build a case for a permanent in-house operation of the Clyde  Hebrides Ferry Service contract.She has called for the Scottish Government to publish the firm’s independent review into governance of ferry services and has sought a guarantee that no part of the current Clyde  Hebrides ferry contract will be handed to a private company.Ms Clark, a vocerous campaigner to keep ferries in the public sector, has repeatedly called for an emergency plan to address issues affecting CalMac’s ageing fleet.She added: “Workers, passenger groups and island communities are clear that investment and replenishing our ageing fleet must be the priority, not selling off leline routes.“The Scottish Government must also rule out the sale of any part of the current Clyde  Hebrides contract to any private company.“Workers, passenger groups and island communities have been clear that renewed investment and replenishing our ageing fleet must be the priority, not selling off leline routes.”It comes as the state-owned ferry operator CalMac is having to handle an ageing ferry fleet with new leline vessels MV Glen Sannox and Hull  still languishing in the now state-owned Ferguson Marine shipyard, with costs of their construction more than doubling from the original £m contract and delivery over four years late.The debacle led to shipyard firm Ferguson Marine led by tycoon Jim McColl, who first rescued the yard going bust, leading to a Scottish Government takeover.An investigation by MSPs on the Scottish Parliament rural economy and connectivity committee into the procurement of the ferries described it in December,  as a “catastrophic failure”.There has since been a series of issues with breakdowns involving Scotlands ageing ferry fleet.While industry experts agree the working le of the ferries is  years,  of the -strong ferry fleet run is older than that, with eight past their th birthday.Analysis using official data shows that from , before devolution, to ,  ferries with a combined tonnage of , were launched - a replacement rate of one in . years.In the following  years, while the SNP was in power and while the working le of the existing fleet was extended from  years to  years, only five ferries with combined tonnage of , were built - a replacement rate of one every . years.A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: “Scottish Ministers have already ruled out privatisation and have no plans to split up the CalMac Ferries network.“The independent review of governance arrangements for Scottish Government leline ferry services will present a framework consisting of a range of options to the overarching objective of effective, efficient and economic delivery of leline ferry services, to enhance passenger experience and support local island economies.“The final report has been completed very recently and the Minister for Transport has given assurances in Parliament that it will be considered as soon as possible.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , the Northern Ireland Executive launched a strategy called Together: Building a United Communitywhich aimed to improve community relations, particularly at interface areas between Catholic and Protestant communities.One of the key aims of the project was the removal of all the so-called peace walls at these interfaces by . However, just a year before the target deadline, around  of the barriers, which remain a stark reminder of the isions within the North, are still standing.The Department of Justicemanages most of the peace walls, while others are maintained by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive .The DoJ has recently issued a tender worth around £, for the maintenance of the structures over the next three years.The first interface structure in Northern Ireland was erected in  at Bombay Street near what is now Cupar Way in the Falls Shankill area of Belfast.Bombay Street was the scene of serious sectarian violence in August  when a number of Catholic families were burned out of their homes by loyalist mobs.The last interface barrier erected in the North was a large fence which was put up in  within the grounds of Hazelwood school, an integrated primary school in Belfast.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Most of the interface structures are in Belfast and Derry, but some barriers were erected in the late s and early s in the Portadown and Lurgan areas as a result of parade-related tensions.However, while many of the interface barriers look set to remain standing for some time, the T:BUC project has had some success in removing or transforming others. In February ,  years after it was erected, the NIHE dismantled an interface barrier on the Crumlin Road in Belfast, removing the eight foot-high brick structure to make way for railings and decorative . The wall, which encloses part of the Ardoyne area, was the first Housing Executive-owned interface to be removed. The wall was erected on the Crumlin Road in the mid-s at the same time as new social family homes were built. It was designed then to give protection to residents living at the interface during the Troubles. The community-led decision to transform the interface barrier was said to have come about after years of relationship building and talks within and between communities in north Belfast. In September , a ft-high brick interface structure which had stood for nearly three decades at Springhill Avenue in Belfast was dismantled. The barrier was erected in  as a security measure to provide extra protection to residents and the nearby New Barnsley police station, iding Springfield Road and Springhill Avenue. The transformation work on the site included the wall being replaced by a fence on which community art work is displayed. The facades and curtilages of two adjacent derelict houses were also improved as part of the scheme.The Nara Place and Serpentine Road project, also in Belfast, involved the redevelopment of an existing play park at Whitecity Community Centre to include the removal of an interface barrier along the Serpentine Road. Engagement with the community showed that the redevelopment of the park would be a vehicle for delivering the removal of the interface and creation of a shared space. The new park opened in .Townsend Street is adjacent to the Westlink and runs in a northerly direction between Divis Street and Peter’s Hill in Belfast. Gates are located between the Presbyterian Church and Townsend Enterprise Park about halfway along Townsend Street. The existing gates were in poor condition and needed to be replaced, so extensive consultation was carried out by the DoJ through the Falls and Shankill Forum around the potential design of new gates. The new gates were installed in June  ahead of other environmental improvement works such as a public lighting upgrade, parking restrictions, and public realm improvements.A DoJ spokesperson told the Sunday Independent that work was continuing which could lead to the removal of more of the peace walls and barriers.“Where there is local appetite to reduce or remove a structure, the department develops options for a suitable scheme,” the spokesperson said.The tender for the new maintenance contract, which will cover interface barriers in Belfast, Derry and Portadown, highlights that the successful applicant may have to oversee “possible changes” to the peace walls following “community agreement”.Among the potential changes to the barriers highlighted are: replacing solid gates with see-through gates partial removal reduction in the height of fencing changing the type of fencing from gates to fencing or the complete removal of an interface structure. The contract will also include maintenance of gates and removal of graffiti from walls, as well as repairing any vandalism to the structures.When the T:BUC initiative was launched in , the Northern Ireland Executive said the removal of all interface barriers by  was a “key objective” of the programme.In a joint statement at the time, First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said it was important that any removal plans had the support of local communities.“Community confidence will only be built when assurances can be given that the intimidation and threat which led to the erection of barriers has been removed. We are committed to finding alternative ways of reassuring communities that safety can be achieved without separation,” said the statement from the Stormont leaders.“Removing interface barriers and other structures of ision will send out an important message that our society is continuing on its journey to peace and reconciliation, but more importantly will bring community benefits.“The elimination of these physical reminders is necessary in progressing as a community and facilitating the reconciliation that has been prevented for so long through ision.” Despite the aims laid out in the T:BUC strategy, interface barriers remain a part of many communities across Northern Ireland. Among the areas in Belfast where the barriers remain are: Bryson Street Thistle Court Madrid Street Cluan Place Clandeboye Gardens Newtownards Road Strand Walk and Ardmoulin Beverley Street.In Derry, barriers are still in place at Bishop Street Harding Street Violet Street Dungiven Road and Tullyally Currynerin.In Portadown and Lurgan, there are interface barriers at Charles Street, Corcrain Road Craigwell Avenue, Corcrain Road Obins Avenue and Margretta Park.Most ReadNI woman’s anger after paying £ for heating oil that hasn’t been deliveredIRA raid on Castlereagh Police Station: ‘People think they know what happened, but they’ve only seen a fraction of it’Michael Conlan #conscious and stable# in hospital after knock out blow from Leigh Wood in dramatic finish to world title fight at Nottingham ArenaPSNI probes claim cop made offensive remarks after football match marred by brawlNI climber killed on Ben Nevis was due to become a fatherTop VideosPlaySteph Basnett on her stalking nightmare by ex Riagain GraingerPlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant Latest Northern Ireland‘Humanitarian response trumps security checks on Ukrainians arriving in Ireland’Pay Covid fines or face jail, Santa’s grotto chef warnedSam McBrideOpinionWe are insulated from Russia’s war on Ukraine, but not its effectsLiam BeckettOpinionIrish League needs upgrade to selection protocols after latest eligibility blunderGareth McAuleyOpinionNIFL’s bold and brave decisions for League Cup final will pay offLatest‘Think carefully’ about Russian investments, Sunak warns businessesScotland ready to welcome , Ukrainian refugees immediately – Sturgeon‘Humanitarian response trumps security checks on Ukrainians arriving in Ireland’Tawny owl ‘will live to fly another night’ after encounter with pond nettingJohnny Sexton backs England to ‘do some real damage’ in France Six Nations clash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Statements from  and  that this newspaper accessed on the website within the last fortnight are no longer available and nowa ‘ Page Not Found’ message.This suggests that thousands of statements have now been systematically removed from the website by the party within the last two weeks. Sinn Féin did not respond to queries as to why this happened. Other political parties have online archives of press statements stretching back several years.The deleted Sinn Féin statements can still be accessed through cached versions that can be searched on Google and through the Wayback Machine, but their removal from the main party website makes it harder for users to access them.One statement that is no longer available on the website is comments from party leader Mary Lou McDonald in March  describing then taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s decision to expel a Russian diplomat over the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, England, as “a flagrant disregard for Irish neutrality”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up In the statement on March , , Ms McDonald demanded the evidence underpinning the decision. “In this case, a decision has been based on information from a foreign security intelligence service, which is an unprecedented step. Essentially, we are being asked to trust Boris Johnson. Dare I say that this might not be the best course of action ” she said. The statement came five days after the European Council concluded it was “highly likely” that the Russian Federation was responsible for the attack and that there was “no plausible alternative explanation”.Another statement hat has been removed is one from former presidential candidate Liadh Ní Riada who, as an MEP in June , welcomed EU backing for the Shannon Liquied Natural Gasterminal describing it as a “hugely important to the North Kerry and West Limerick region”. Sinn Féin now opposes this project.Another statement that has disappeared from the website is one from former foreign affairs spokesperson Seán Crowe supporting the abolition of Nato in . Mr Crowe had said the military alliance was “nothing more than a Cold War relic that needs to be disbanded”.Askedthis was still the party position last month, a Sinn Féin spokesperson said: “It is our strongly held view that reversing Ireland’s policy of neutrality, or involvement in military blocs such as Nato or Pesco, is not in our interests. What other nations consider appropriate is a matter for them.”Of the other main parties, Fianna Fáil has copies of press statements on its website that go back as far as October . “We developed a new website after the  general election, and press statements available online date from then,” a spokesperson said.An examination of Fine Gael’s website shows it has press statements that go back to March , although a party spokesperson said statements going back to  are available on its website.The Green Party has press statements on its website going back as far as March . The party did not respond to queries.Meanwhile, Labour has an archive of press statements that goes as far back as January , just before the end of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition government. “The Labour Party launched a new website in November  during party conference. As part of that process developers migrated all media statements from  onwards. We maintain a full offline archive with a record of all statements dating back to ,” a party spokesperson said.Related topicsSinn FéinMore On Sinn Féin PremiumSinn Fein set trap for Denis Donaldson handler… Elaborate plot to record double agent’s police contact revealedRival unionists trying to undermine UUP, claims Doug BeattieTim McGarry: ‘I’m p****d off I didn’t get to play Pa in Belfast...

The festival was last held in .Cllr Hanna said that while it was disappointing that this yearrsquos event would not be going ahead, a number of suggestions for an alternative festival had been made. He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough. He steadied himself and began to address his companions.lsquoHe lted one hand and pointed ahead. He named the parts. He spoke of horses and ploughing points. He strained and balanced and explained. Against the grey stone wall of the old gaol yard he conjured up the green fields of another le.lsquoOne of the nurses who came with the visiting party said to me: ldquoDo you know, thatrsquos the first time he has spoken for three years.rsquoThese words opened a chapter in the book Down on the Farm, published by Down County Museum in .They were specially chosen to help us understand that museum collections and activities are not just static objects or exercises in nostalgia. While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

As with all aspects of museum work, this required both local and specialist knowledge, active travelling around the area and respectful relationships with the community.The museum developed a unique relationship with the community that was based on valuing and understanding the importance of lsquopeople and placersquo.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July. It will replace the townrsquos previous mart which closed two years ago.However, the mart is part of a much larger project which includes plans for animal processing facilities, a conference centre and extensive retailing outlets.Mr Hugh Linehan, chairman of the co-operative, says it will be the most advanced project of its kind in Northern Ireland and will bring jobs and wealth to the area.ldquoWe see this as the way ahead for local agriculture, Mr Linehan said yesterday.Funding for the mart phase is largely complete.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Politically the situation is much more complicated in the eastern part of Ukraine. People in the eastern part of the country are very Russian. But % of the people in the Ukraine donrsquot care about politics and just what a happy, peaceful le.Mr Johnston described the now impractical steps his relatives which have to taken in order to get a visa.ldquoThey would normally have to travel  hours on an overnight train from Mariupol to Kyiv to get a visa granted for travel. In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe -year-old, who represented the British and Irish Lions last summer, was involved in four of the Scots’ tries as they defeated Italy - on Saturday to claim the Cuttitta Cup in their penultimate Guinness Six Nations fixture.Steyn was delighted to see his Glasgow clubmate excel on such a landmark occasion for him. vw,vw,px, px\"Ali Price celebrates with the Cuttitta Cup “Ali’s unbelievable,” said Steyn. “It was great to see, especially on his th cap. He’s someone who wears his heart on his sleeve.“We all know how much playing for Scotland means to him. It was great to see him at his best – attacking, running the ball, making line-breaks and creating tries.”Several of Scotland’s flair players came to the fore on a day when they scored five eye-catching tries, and wing Steyn believes it bodes well for next weekend’s campaign-concluding trip to Ireland.A good team win on the road. #AsOne pic PBDgESqmm— Scottish RugbyMarch , “The strength of our attack was a massive positive,” said Steyn. “A lot of it came from turnover and our ability to quickly transition, which we’re really chuffed with.“We just want to take that forward to Dublin, where we know that game management and playing rugby in the right areas of the park is going to be crucial early on.“We’ll back ourselves to take chances when they arise, but the biggest thing is we need to be ready to go there and front up.”While Scotland generally attacked impressively in Rome, they were undermined by some slack defending which resulted in them conceding three tries, including two in the closing quarter.Reflecting on the Italy match overall, Steyn said: “I think first up, five points away from home in the Six Nations, you’re going to take that any day of the week..remove“We knew especially on defence we weren’t as consistent as we wanted to be, but I thought that for most of the game we controlled it pretty well and played rugby where we wanted to play it: in their half.“We were disappointed we didn’t kick on in that second half and really make it count. We weren’t happy to finish the match the way we did but everything just turns to next week now and we know that defending like that next week isn’t going to be good enough.“The game in Dublin is going to be massive, and finishing on a high is the top priority for us.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Kyle Steyn hails Ali Price after Scotland scrum-half stars in win against Italy article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe romance gap, a term coined by Bumble, is a term for the disparity between men and women and our expectations of the genders when it comes to relationships and dating.% of respondents believed men are still expected to make the first move, according to a YouGov poll that was commissioned by Bumble.Almost  in  people in the UKsaid they expect men to take the lead but only % expected the same from women.Bumbles latest research suggests that daters want a very dferent kind of relationship dynamic.% of Brits say that equality is important between people who are dating or in a relationship.Meanwhile, % of respondents said that there are dferent expectations and expected behaviours depending on your gender when it comes to relationships.                                                                                                            :  Best Dating Sites in the UK to Find that Special Someone: Tinder is introducing a new security feature for users - is it coming to the UK                                                                                                            In other words, an overwhelming majority believe that there is a romance gap and that there are pressures for men and women to act a certain way.The dating app recognises that we have made \"positive strides towards equality, traditional gender roles and expectations are still very present, and even, accepted in dating\".In fact, some behaviours that we deem romantic for men are viewed negativelythey come from a woman.The research, which collected responses from across Europe, found that:.removeMen are still expected to take the lead: Over half of peoplestate that society expects men to take the lead in relationships, rising to almost  in  in the UK , whilst a mere % think society expects women to do so. For men, just over  in feel pressured to take the lead.Women should not appear desperate: In the UK, more than halfstate women are expected to avoid appearing too keen, clingy, attached or desperate. Interestingly this is felt signicantly more by womenthan men .Men worry about their lack of experience between the sheets: Nearly a fthof British men are concerned about being judged for their lack of sexual experience. Almost the same amount of womenfear they’ll be judged for the opposite - their number of intimate encounters. Women have a ‘shelf-le’ in dating: % state that women are expected to prioritise finding a relationship and settle down before they are ‘too old’. In contrast, only % say that society expects this of men. For women,  in have felt pressure to compromise on what they want while dating or in relationships. Men are expected to be the breadwinners: In the UK,  in say men are expected to earn more money and be responsible for finances, with only % agreeing this is expected of women.  in women have felt concerned of being judged for earning more than their partner. Women are changing their behaviour: Amidst all these expectations, it’s no surprise that  in women have changed their behaviour to make someone feel more powerful or comfortable. A couple on a date. Credit: Canva The new campaign forms part of Bumble’s efforts to empower people to create healthy and equitable relationships and combat \"outdated\" gender dynamics.“The Romance Gap is a new term, but many of us will know the feeling. Those moments of questioningsending that text makes you appear too keen, waiting for them to take the lead, or worryingyou are being judged for being too keen, too inexperienced, too old. At Bumble, we are focused on creating an app that empowers women to make the first move and date on their own terms from the beginning. But we alone cannot change societal expectations,\" Naomi Walkland, Bumble’s VP for Europe said.Ms Walkland continued: “An unexamined Romance Gap limits us, with  in  people agreeing that it makes it dficult to build equal relationships. The only way to reduce the Romance Gap is to acknowledge it exists and start an open conversation about how it impacts how we see ourselves, our partners, and relationships. Only when we are aware of it can we challenge each other to do away with gendered expectations of who should do what.”Its not just that the outdated genre dynamics are bad for equality, they stop us from making genuine connections with people, the dating app believes.According to its research, % say the impact of gender roles makes people behave in a way that is less true to who they are.It does appear though that change is on its way with % of respondents believing that in an ideal world we would not have expectations on who earns more, a more successful career , or who makes the first move by initiating a date .You can see the rest of Bumbles research, campaign and tips on striking up a conversation via the Bumble website."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/penarth_news/resources/images/13569145.jpg","title":"penarth news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.
