I was tearing up as I saw her,\u0027 Kunselman told DailyMail.com. \u0027Kelsey was pre-boarding and I saw the young mother traveling with a child that needed oxygen. She was so tiny.\u0027Kelsey was taking the infant to the Children\u0027s Hospital of Philadelphia because her baby suffers from severe chronic lung disease as a result of a complication during the pregnancy. Upon seeing how small baby Lucy was and the fact she needed to travel with specialist medical equipment, the American Airlines Executive Platinum frequent flier thought nothing of the gesture he was about to make and offered her his comfy spacious seat at the front of the plane.Flying the unfriendly skies: Journalist suggests airlines...Cops release bodycam footage of a domestic dispute between...Share this articleJason said that he was also tearing up as he switched seats seeing how tiny the baby girl was          The touching gesture, which Ms Zwick said she \u0027can\u0027t wait to tell Lucy someday\u0027, brought her to tears. Kelsey has since been in touch with Jason. She said, \u0027the world clearly needed kindness\u0027\u0027I expected to see her in the front since she had the oxygen machine with her but when I boarded she was in the back. So I asked the flight attendant if she thought the young lady with the baby would be more comfortable in my seat. He approached a flight attendant and asked if the mother and baby he had seen might be more comfortable sitting in first class.As the pair switched seats, Jason could see that Kelsey was crying with gratitude. But the emotion also got to Jason too, who began to tear up at what he had just witnessed.\u0027I just hoped that she had a better flight with more room,\u0027 he said.His act of kindness saw him occupying Kelsey\u0027s previous seat at the back of the plane. He jokes that being so far back almost caused him to miss his connection to Harrisburg.   Lucy, a twin born 11 weeks early, stayed in the NICU for 100 days after she was born. Her sister stayed 86 days          The past two years have been quite a journey for Kelsey Zwick, her husband, and their twin daughters, Lucy and Eva.

Today you were traveling from Orlando to Philly. I don\u0027t know you, but I imagine you saw us somewhere. I was pushing a stroller, had a diaper bag on my arm and also lugging an oxygen machine for my daughter.           Jason was told that his good deed had gone viral after wife, Kristy, saw the story online\u0027We had smiles on our faces as we were headed to see her \u0027friends\u0027 at CHOP (Children\u0027s Hospital of Philadelphia)\u0027, Zwick began in her much-talked-about Facebook post.\u0027We pre-boarded the plane, got cozy in our window seat and made jokes to those around us about having to sit by my yelling-but-happy baby. The flight attendant came over and told me you were waiting to switch seats. You were giving up your comfortable, first class seat to us.Kelsey said that the good deed offered by the fellow passenger reminded her how \u0027blessed\u0027 she and her husband, Yuri, are. \u0027Not able to hold back tears, I cried my way up the aisle while my daughter Lucy laughed! \u0027She felt it in her bones too... real, pure, goodness. I smiled and thanked you as we switched but didn\u0027t get to thank you properly.\u0027Sooo... thank you. Not just for the seat itself but for noticing. \u0027For seeing us and realizing that maybe things are not always easy. For deciding you wanted to show a random act of kindness to US.

The Pound plunged on the news. Mrs May is understood to have told senior ministers that she still believes hers is the \u0027right deal\u0027, but conceded it was on course for a devastating defeat tomorrow evening. She could now fly out to the EU as early as tonight in bid to get sweeteners for the agreement. The decision drew derision from critics, including Tories.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the PM of \u0027pathetic cowardice\u0027 and demanded Labour join a no confidence vote to collapse the government, while Conservative MP Nick Boles jibed: \u0027Nothing has changed, right?\u0027 The new timings are unclear, but under the EU Withdrawal Act the government must lay out its plans to Parliament by January 21 at the latest. Mrs May is making what could be an agonising statement to MPs later this afternoon.There are also some doubts about whether Mrs May will be able to shelve the vote, with some Tory Brexiteers and Remainers vowing to try and force a ision anyway. No10 insists no vote will be necessary to put off the showdown.  A climbdown will allow Mrs May to avoid catastrophic defeat, and go back to Brussels to try to get more concessions. But it would also demonstrate how low her authority has sunk.The EU has also flatly dismissed the idea that there could be substantive concessions on the orce package, with Irish PM Leo Varadkar insisting it is \u0027not possible\u0027 to change the deal. Brexit brawl hurts Britain, says RUTH SUNDERLAND, with our...Share this article    European Court of Justice judge Carl Gustav Fernlund read out the ruling on Article 50 at the court in Luxembourg today (pictured) EU judges delivered a boost for Remainer rebels today by ruling that Britain can unilaterally cancel Brexit. The European Court of Justice decided that Article 50 can be withdrawn by the UK without permission from other member states.Britain would keep its current terms of membership if it quit the process - meaning keeping the rebate, the opt out from the Euro and exemptions from the Schengen passport-free zone.Today\u0027s ruling will encourage hopes from pro-EU MPs that a second referendum can be held to stop the UK from leaving the bloc altogether. But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the ruling was \u0027irrelevant\u0027 as it was \u0027certainly not the intention of the government\u0027 to delay Brexit. The case was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.                                                      He gave a clear indication that the government is seeking concessions from the EU, saying there was \u0027no-one better placed\u0027 than Mrs May to get more concessions.But he warned there were significant \u0027risks\u0027 in reopening the Withdrawal Agreement thrashed out with Brussels, including France seeking more access to fishing waters and Spain troublemaking over Gibraltar.Mr Gove dismissed suggestions that Mrs May could be helped in her efforts by a heavy defeat in Parliament. In a reference to the famous resignation speech by Geoffrey Howe that sunk Margaret Thatcher, he warned that would be the \u0027equivalent of breaking the cricket bat in half before the leader went to the crease\u0027. \u0027If colleagues really want to help the PM I\u0027m sure the PM would urge them gently but firmly to support her tomorrow,\u0027 Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom is due to make a statement to MPs after Mrs May addresses them this afternoon - which could give an indication of how long the vote has been put off.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will also make a separate statement later tonight, on the Article 50 ruling by the ECJ. DUP leader Arlene Foster said this afternoon: \u0027Just finished a call with the Prime Minister. My message was clear. \u0027The backstop must go. Too much time has been wasted. Need a better deal. Disappointed it has taken so long for Prime Minister to listen.\u0027 To drop the vote tomorrow, Mrs May might need to win a vote of MPs tonight on changing the business.Some of her MPs are already suggesting they could vote against a delay – raising the prospect of her being humiliatingly forced into holding it.Brexiteer and arch May critic James Duddridge warned she could not just delay a vote.He said: \u0027The House will have to vote to pull a vote. I will oppose.\u0027We need to see this deal off once and for all.\u0027Remain supporter and former minister Philip Lee said pulling the vote would \u0027just delay the inevitable\u0027 because Brussels will not give concessions.He tweeted: \u0027Actual choice before Parliament is between a People\u0027s Vote or a No Deal Brexit.\u0027Let\u0027s get on with making that decision.\u0027 Mrs May spoke with EU council president Mr Tusk last night as she considers a bid to squeeze more concessions out of the EU.      The decision drew derision from critics, including Tory MP Nick Boles - who has been pushing for a \u0027Norway plus\u0027 outcome from the Brexit processAn EU summit is scheduled for the end of the week, which could provide a stage for Mrs May to emulate Margaret Thatcher and have a \u0027handbag moment\u0027 to demand more concessions on the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027. After the vote on the Brexit deal was postponed, children\u0027s minister Nadhim Zahawi tweeted: \u0027@theresa_may has listened to colleagues and will head to Brussels to push back on the backstop.\u0027 But Ireland\u0027s deputy PM Simon Coveney today delivered a savage blow by dismissing her chances of getting fresh concessions on Brexit. He insisted the deal is \u0027not going to change\u0027. In a clear leadership pitch yesterday, Mr Johnson  predicted that Mrs May would lose her crunch vote on the deal by a huge margin.Looking visibly emotional as he appeared on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show, he said the UK can do \u0027much much better\u0027 than the PM\u0027s deal.There have been claims that Home Secretary Sajid Javid is also brazenly canvassing Cabinet colleagues for a tilt at the top job if Mrs May is ousted. Aides insisted he is focused on helping the PM get her deal through.In a sign of what could be a torrent of resignations if and when she goes ahead with the vote, Tory MP Will Quince yesterday quit as a parliamentary aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.At least two government whips were understood to be considering falling on their swords in order to vote against the Brexit package. Mrs May\u0027s position was further undermined today when the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally halt the Brexit process by withdrawing Article 50.The judgement that permission is not needed was hailed by Remainers as opening the door to holding a second referendum. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in Brussels for regular talks with counterparts this morning, said the government has no intention of reversing Article 50 and voters would be \u0027shocked\u0027 if it did. Senior ministers including David Lidington and David Gauke are said to be in talks with Labour over whether a second referendum or a Norway-style deal would break the deadlock.    Mr Gove dismissed suggestions that Mrs May could be helped in her efforts by a heavy defeat in ParliamenSir Alan was on air on BBC\u0027s Politics Live programme as the news of the Brexit delay emerged - risking controversy by laughing as he was told the government was in chaos. Appearing on Radio 4 earlier, he claimed his Tory colleagues lining up to oppose Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal had not \u0027thought strategically enough about what the consequences of that would be\u0027.\u0027The first is that even if they overturn it they are not necessarily going to get an alternative which they are campaigning for, and instead what they will probably do is set in train a course of events which could lead to chaos in many, many areas,\u0027 he told the Today programme.He warned there could be a leadership contest, or a general election, and said the UK could be \u0027top dog in Europe at the moment when France is burning and Germany is in transition\u0027 but instead \u0027we\u0027re just beating ourselves up\u0027.Sir Alan also said Tory former foreign secretary Boris Johnson would be \u0027met with a very, very loud raspberry in many, many different languages\u0027 if he walked into a negotiating room in Brussels.And he warned: \u0027What I really resent is the glee some people have in wanting to oppose this, and then in jostling for their own personal gain. This is contemptible. \u0027Let\u0027s be absolutely clear that if this goes pear-shaped in the way that it really could, on the back of people opposing the deal that is on offer tomorrow night, the wreckers in history will forever be known as the wreckers.\u0027Mr Dodds said: \u0027This vote has been pulled because it would have been overwhelmingly defeated. Deferring the vote is only of any use if the Government is prepared to go to Brussels and insist on necessary changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. \u0027Few people accepted this was the best deal available and the Prime Minister\u0027s actions today prove that.\u0027 Mutinous Tories are furious at her deal\u0027s Irish backstop plan, which would see the UK tied to the customs union and more single market checks have to be carried out in Northern Ireland.They warn the UK cannot pull out of the backstop without the EU\u0027s permission - potentially keeping the UK \u0027locked\u0027 to Brussels against its will.Amid mounting opposition to the deal, civil servants have war-gamed two versions of the UK holding another referendum.The first is a straight choice between the PM\u0027s deal and remaining in the EU, and the second would be a leave, remain contest with a  second question asking them if they prefer the existing deal or a no-deal departure on World Trade Organisation terms, The Sunday Times reported.  If Mrs May loses an immediate no-confidence vote tomorrow, Parliament could have to sit on Christmas Day because the Fixed Term Parliament Act sets a deadline of 14 calendar days for a new Government to be formed, meaning December 25 would be the last chance for any coalition to try to win a Commons majority. It\u0027s believed that the last time the Commons sat on Christmas Day was in 1656.    If these are Theresa May\u0027s final days in Downing Street, she seems remarkably sanguine about it, drinking from a mug which says \u0027proud to be a Bloody Difficult Woman\u0027 and using a hole punch which read \u0027please do not remove from office\u0027     Boris Johnson is the bookies\u0027 favourite to take over if the Brexit chaos forces Theresa May out of Downing Street There is the prospect of large scale resignations if Mrs May does press ahead - with at least two government whips understood to be among those contemplating quitting.In a flavour of what could come, Tory MP Will Quince yesterday quit as a parliamentary aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.  Senior Conservatives also warn that a no-confidence vote in Mrs May\u0027s leadership is inevitable if she does not back down before the vote. Mr Javid has reportedly begun to build a team of ministers to support his bid to become the first non-white Prime Minister, ahead of Tuesday\u0027s crunch Brexit deal vote in Parliament.  Aides played down the claims, insisting he is focused on helping the PM get her deal through. Mr Javid\u0027s supporters are believed to include Liz Truss - who last week was overhead telling a friend that Mr Javid had to be ready to take over. Mr Johnson, meanwhile, also hinted at a possible leadership bid after outlining his plans for another negotiation with the EU.                                                     "},{"url":null,"title":"Playful pooch wakes teenager pulling bedding wont no answer","story":"Winnie the black and white Boston terrier  uses its paws to pull back the blanket as Ellie Kettering, 15, lies sleepingTeasing the dog, Ellie pulls back the sheet - to which Winnie immediately pulls it back again.Laughing at the hilarious scene, the teenager does this numerous times but Winnie refuses to take no for an answer.Ewe aren\u0027t a dog!

Prince William and Kate SKIP a board...Share this articleThis is just his fourth interview since the fall-out with Harry and Meghan after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.Today, in a wide-ranging interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle, for the first time, categorically rejects some of the most ‘grievous’ lies against him and produces evidence in the form of photographs, medical statements and even a faded plane ticket that he says proves he is telling the truth:          They are the words of love from a daughter who clearly adores her father. In a Valentine\u0027s card, Meghan writes: \u0027Daddy, Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. ‘All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – her childhood nickname‘Everything has been met with a stony silence. Their silence means people continue to attack me and write lies about me.’Mr Markle says he has been surprised by a spate of recent negative stories about his daughter that portray her as a petulant a.One claimed she reduced a staff member to tears with her 5am demands and another said she wanted to spray air freshener around ‘musty’ St George’s Chapel – a request rejected by the Queen.Perhaps the most damaging claim concerns an alleged rift between Meghan and Kate, who is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid gown and who later, allegedly, reprimanded Meghan for ‘berating’ a member of her staff.Kate is said to have told Meghan: ‘That’s unacceptable. They’re my staff and I speak to them.’Meghan’s father says he is baffled by the reports. ‘I don’t recognise this person,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘The Meghan I know was always sweet, kind, generous. She was always demanding but never rude. I don’t want to say or do anything to hurt my daughter but I worry she is going to hurt herself.’And in a Christmas card, left, showing a colourful llama, she writes: ‘Because you have always been so generous with me… it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’ Inside was a gift of $2,000 for a holidayMr Markle, a retired Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, adds: ‘Meghan grew up on set. I taught her to have respect for the crew. They can make you look good or awful. I don’t pretend to know what she’s like now.‘She bends the rules. She’s good at that. But this acting up is new. She’s never been rude to me before. I can’t believe I’ve done anything severe enough to be treated this way by her.’ Indeed, he believes his bond with Meghan is ‘unbreakable’ – a point illustrated by two cards from his treasured collection.Meghan trained as a calligrapher and wrote wedding invitations to help support herself through the early days of her acting career, a skill highlighted in her cards to her father, which are written in elegant cursive script.‘I loved getting cards from Meghan,’ Mr Markle says. ‘She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, “I love you Daddy.” I see it every day. I got a card every Valentine’s Day.’ He pulls one Valentine’s card from a manila folder. It shows a picture of a chubby baby holding a daffodil with a touching message: ‘Daddy… I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – a reference to his childhood nickname for her.    Mr Markle suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor when she married Prince Harry - who he is yet to meetOver the years, Mr Markle ‘willingly’ spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his daughter, sending her to private school and even cashing in Facebook shares to help pay for her first wedding.A Christmas card showing a llama and the words ‘Fa-La-La Llama’ arrived at Mr Markle’s Mexican home just a couple of years ago, by which time Meghan was a successful actress, earning $50,000 (£40,000) an episode on the hit TV show Suits. The card contained $2,000 for him to put towards a holiday. She wrote: ‘Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’For Mr Markle, the prospect of never speaking to his daughter again is unbearable: ‘I’m hurt by what’s happened but I’m not going to stay silent.          In a wide-ranging interview with Caroline Graham near his home in Mexico, Mr Markle revealed the anguish he feels at the thought of never seeing his daughter again‘My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry. When they announced her pregnancy I had seven paparazzi on my doorstep night and day for seven days. They rented the house next door.‘Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.‘I’m trolled on the internet by one guy who sits in his mother’s basement spewing lies about me. Twitter is the worst but I can’t avoid it.‘I don’t read things but then people send them to me anyway. They say I faked my heart attacks, that I wasn’t at the first wedding. It’s all bull****. Meghan and I never had any problems before this.‘If she would just speak to me, things could be different. I love Meghan very much. I want her and Harry to have a beautiful, healthy baby and a great life.‘But I want them to stop believing the lies.’Does he believe he and Meghan will ever be reunited?He shrugs. ‘Maybe. Some day.’  \u0027I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown\u0027: Thomas Markle unveils touching photograph that proves he DID go to his daughter\u0027s first wedding but said no to the party bag marijuana He was reduced to what he calls ‘a footnote in history’ when two heart attacks prevented him from walking his daughter Meghan down the aisle of St George’s Chapel amid the pomp and pageantry of the Royal Wedding in May.But Thomas Markle did take a starring role at Meghan’s very different first wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson in 2011, which took place under swaying palm trees on a Jamaican beach, complete with a Caribbean steel drum band and a most unusual welcome gift for the guests.Mr Markle says he is ‘sick and tired’ of reading erroneous reports that he failed to attend the wedding, which sadly ended in orce for the couple two years later. He explains that he asked the photographer to ignore him and concentrate on the young people showing off their beautiful bodies in swimwear.          The invitationto Meghan’s first wedding showed her entwined with Trevor on a beach with a beer‘There are no pictures out there of me at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone else was in their 30s and I was in my 60s’, Mr Markle said last night, before showing The Mail on Sunday a photograph – published here for the first time. It shows him posing proudly with Meghan just moments before he and his ex-wife Doria walked her across the sand to marry Trevor.Mr Markle also kept his business-class ticket to the four-day affair, along with an invitation, which featured a picture of a bikini-wearing Meghan on the beach entwined in Trevor’s arms, and a chilled bottle of Red Stripe beer within arm’s reach.The wedding took place at the famous Jamaica Inn, where Meghan booked all 55 rooms and villas, taking the £1,200-a-night largest villa for herself and her new husband.‘Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail. She took control of everything. I was given a white shirt to wear, as were all the male guests. She micro-managed everything,’ says Mr Markle.‘The picture was taken when I walked into her bungalow just moments before the ceremony was due to start. I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown, looking so beautiful. We took the picture and then Doria and I both walked her down the aisle.‘Trevor is Jewish and his father, who is a rabbi, conducted the service. But it was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. Meghan read vows she’d written herself.’          Prince Harry severely berated Mr Markle after he posed for photos before the royal wedding - contributing to their riftEach heartfelt word reveals the true sentiments of a devoted daughter. Meghan’s love for Thomas Markle is as plain as day.Yet today he is a pariah. At 74, in failing health in his twilight years, he is spending Christmas ostracised by his daughter. Heartbroken, cut off and cast out into the cold by an angry and indignant Meghan.The irony will be lost on the new Duchess of Sussex, as she fine-tunes her favoured philanthropic causes, that charity, as the saying goes, should begin at home. But to her, Thomas has become an embarrassment and a rolling public humiliation.Unable to manage and control him, she has pulled up the drawbridge. Behind the castle walls she will not – cannot – be reached. While Thomas feels wounded, Meghan feels betrayed. She is unwilling to climb down from the battlements. Meghan’s Royal ambition is leaving a large and untidy wake.She has in the past been accused of using people and then quickly moving on up the ladder, never looking back.It may be harsh to say she’s ‘ghosting’ her father – the fashionable term used when someone cuts off all communication without warning or explanation. Thomas prefers to describe her behaviour as ‘acting up’. But what’s certain is that she has approached her new Royal life at full tilt, head down, powering through.As Thomas says: ‘She was a control freak but never in a bad way – she was always sweet and kind.’Meghan’s marriage to Prince Harry wasn’t simply falling in love – although that was the main impetus – it was a life transformation of unimaginable proportions.A girl raised in a series of Los Angeles apartment blocks, who reinvented herself as a successful TV actress, is now reinventing herself as a princess.Since joining the House of Windsor her personal style has got more regal and refined. She has made sure social issues are front and centre of her public persona, like her high-profile cookbook launch to help Grenfell survivors with mum Doria in tow. And, of course, she plays the Royal wife with aplomb, as we have seen on the couple’s dazzling tour to Australia and New Zealand. She is, as one source says, ‘putting everything into this’. And as Thomas observes, his perfectionist daughter has always liked to micro-manage her life.Meghan knew her arrival in the Royal circle would be tricky. A orcee, a woman with history, there was always the chance of a disgruntled ex speaking out.What no one expected – and what has repeatedly wrong-footed Palace officials – is that it would be her immediate family who would prove to be the headache.While Doria has been the personification of discretion, Meghan views her father’s meandering outbursts during this critical time as a reminder of where she came from – not where she’s going. And right now, she finds it unforgivable. A post she shared on her old lifestyle blog The Tig gives a telling insight into how she deals with such ‘negative experiences’.She quoted Portuguese life coach José Micard Teixeira, who wrote: ‘I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.’This philosophy still drives Meghan’s thinking and has been firmly applied to her father’s behaviour.From day one she has appeared to play favourites with her parents – Doria got an official Palace scroll announcing their wedding, Thomas didn’t. Doria was formally invited to the nuptials, Thomas wasn’t. And he was very hurt when told he couldn’t make a speech at the reception.In most family feuds, it takes a third party – a husband or partner – to intervene, break the entrenched positions and tactfully suggest the offer of an olive branch might be the best way forward.Harry should have been that peacemaker. But headstrong, unworldly and in thrall to his starry, beautiful wife he did nothing to calm the brewing storm.Rather than respectfully meeting his father-in-law face to face before the couple’s engagement was announced, he chose a quick chat on the phone. Harry – or rather his advisers – had the chance to bring Thomas into the Royal tent before the world even knew Meghan and Harry were a couple. It was a dropped ball that has led us to this point.When, only days before the wedding, Thomas foolishly agreed to stunt some photographs, Harry was on the phone again, this time to severely berate him. Thomas, recovering from urgent heart surgery and deeply embarrassed by his actions, pulled out of his daughter’s big day. Some Royal insiders suggested he faked the surgery to find an excuse, but, as we reveal today, it actually saved his life.For Meghan, the joy of her Windsor Castle wedding shared by the world was a chance to put all the unpleasantness behind her. She decided to take a ‘time out’ from her Dad, but neglected to communicate that to him properly. Once again, he felt hurt and slighted and reacted angrily in a live TV interview.Right now it’s hard to see Meghan giving ground. Just in practical terms she is heavily pregnant, working with interior designers and armed with swatch fabric and paint samples, to redevelop the couple’s new home, Frogmore Cottage, in time for the spring birth. She won’t be jumping on a plane to Mexico to make peace with her father in those circumstances. But with Thomas in ailing health, Harry needs to man up and fix what he inadvertently set off in the first place by failing to show Meghan’s father the necessary respect. Only then will Meghan and her father be reunited.Time is a great healer – but time is also something that we can never have enough of. Harry and Prince William spoke movingly last year of how they are haunted by their last hurried phone call to their mother, Princess Diana, the evening before she died.They were eager to get off the phone because they were having such a great time playing with their cousins at Balmoral. Harry said in an interview: ‘I can’t really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.’It’s a sentiment we have all felt in one way or another. A visit we never made, a call not returned, and suddenly the chance to say what we wanted to say is gone for ever.Meghan is at heart a good and generous woman who is ambitious and could be critical in the reinvention of the Royal Family for another generation.But what she cannot be is forever cast as the cruelly unforgiving daughter of a heartbroken and lonely old man.And Harry holds the key to making sure that doesn’t happen – before it’s too late."},{"url":null,"title":"Jay Zs scholarship fund barely gives students money pay books","story":"Florida mom flying American Airlines with baby to hospital...Share this article    Jay-Z and wife Beyonce ended up dishing out a further 10 scholarships of $100,000 each during their On The Road II tour\u0027The foundation\u0027s goal is to reach as many students as possible.

I want to devote myself to the happiness of the people so I will make an effort to that end.\u0027Referencing her illness, Masako said: \u0027I am delighted at the fact that I can perform more duties than before as I have tried to improve my physical condition.\u0027          Masako was born the daughter of a diplomat and was schooled at Harvard and Oxford, before starting a career as a diplomat herselfBut her doctors warned in a separate statement that it is important for the crown princess to continue treatment as she remains vulnerable to fatigue, especially after a large ceremony or successive duties.She has made few public appearances since 2003. Masako was born in Japan in 1963 as the eldest daughter of a diplomat father, and spent much of her early life living abroad - first in Russia, then America.She studied at Harvard before returning to Japan, where she met her future husband at a diplomatic event in 1986.Masako soon left the country again, going to England to study for her masters at Oxford, but never finished her thesis and returned to her country of birth in 1990.Despite her time living abroad, Naruhito kept up his interest in her, and she was twice forced to turn down his marriage proposals to pursue her career.But she eventually relented after he said becoming a princess would allow her to stay involved in diplomacy, and accepted the third proposal on her birthday in 1992. The pair married the following year. They have one daughter, named Aiko, who was born in 2001. For a time she faced pressure to produce a male heir, but that eased in 2006 when her sister-in-law gave birth to Prince Hisahito, now 12.Emperor Akihito, Naruhito\u0027s father, will become the first Japanese emperor to abdicate in 200 years when he steps down from the throne on 30 April, 2019.          She rejected two proposals from Prince Naruhito before eventually accepting his third offer on her birthday in 1992 when he persuaded her that becoming a princess was another form of diplomacy (pictured meeting Jordan\u0027s King Abdullah in 2018)          Emperor Akihito (far left) will become the first Japanese ruler to abdicate in 200 years when he hands the throne over to Prince Naruhito (second right) on May 1 next yearAkihito\u0027s elder son Crown Prince Naruhito, 57, will ascend the throne a day later.Akihito, 84, has been on the throne since 1989 but expressed his  wish to step down in 2016, citing his age and health. However post-war legislation had not allowed for abdication, so a one-off law was adopted in June to accommodate the emperor\u0027s wishes.He added: \u0027I feel deeply moved that the decision was made by the Imperial Household Agency making a major step toward an imperial succession.\u0027The last Japanese emperor to step down was Kokaku, who did so in favour of his son Ninko in 1817.Akihito\u0027s desire to leave the throne has revived a debate about the country\u0027s 2,000-year-old monarchy, one of the world\u0027s oldest, and has fuelled discussion about improving the status of female members of the shrinking royal population.The current male-only succession rules prohibit women from succeeding to the throne and female members lose their royal status when they marry a commoner.It means that, as it stands, Naruhito\u0027s only child Princess Aiko will not be able to inherit the throne after her father.Instead, Naruhito\u0027s younger brother Prince Fumihito will become crown prince following Akihito\u0027s abdication with his son, Prince Hisahito then in line to succeed. "},{"url":null,"title":"Kates three bedroom Chelsea home shared sister Pippa sale 1 95m","story":"    The Chelsea home that Kate Middleton shared with her sister Pippa before she became the Duchess of Cambridge has been put up for sale for £1.95million          The bedrooms are decorated with calm and neutral colours and simple furnishings.

Last year, 570,000 pilgrims visited a restricted part of the river bank, which was opened to the public in 2011. The work requires another eight months to a year to complete, said Moshe Hilman of Israel\u0027s defence ministry.Mines and other ordnance have been cleared from Ethiopian and Greek Orthodox monastery sites as well as a Franciscan chapel, organisers said.          Bullet marks are seen on the columns inside the church while another can be seen far in the distance. Other grounds belonging to Russian, Syrian, Romanian and Coptic Orthodox churchesOther grounds belonging to Russian, Syrian, Romanian and Coptic Orthodox churches are yet to be cleared.The plan once complete is to return the plots to the various church denominations and allow visits.\u0027The Halo Trust has reached a pivotal point in our work to clear the baptism site of landmines and other remnants of war,\u0027 the charity\u0027s CEO James Cowan said in a statement.He added that \u0027we have completed clearance of the Ethiopian, Greek and Franciscan churches.\u0027           The Franciscan church at Qasr al Yahud baptism site is seen for the first time since 1967 during a combined operation of the Israeli sapper landmine authority and the HALO Trust organisation          The site is home to different church denominations, and access to the church plots and surroundings has been restricted since 1967  Three churches on the Qasr al Yahud baptism site were cleared of mines and there are four still to go. Defense Ministry officials expect to find approximately three thousand targets, consisting of anti-personnel mines, anti-tank mines, and other explosive remnants of war          A sapper landmine clearance personal belonging to the HALO Trust, walks during demining efforts next to an abandoned church at Qasr al Yahud baptism site "},{"url":null,"title":"Generous class flier speaks giving seat anxious Florida mom","story":"    Jason Kunselman, 41, has been identified as the man in seat 2D who gave up his seat for a mother with a chronically ill 11-month-old baby daughter           Zwick said she and Lucy, one of two premature twins, had boarded American Airlines flight 588 when a flight attendant approached them and informed them a passenger in first class wanted to switch seats          Kelsey Rae Zwick was traveling from Orlando to Philly with her 11-month-old daughter, Lucy, for treatment at the Children\u0027s Hospital when a complete stranger made a touching gesture\u0027She had an oxygen machine for her daughter.

The Pound plunged on the news. Mrs May is understood to have told senior ministers that she still believes hers is the \u0027right deal\u0027, but conceded it was on course for a devastating defeat tomorrow evening. She could now fly out to the EU as early as tonight in bid to get sweeteners for the agreement. The decision drew derision from critics, including Tories.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the PM of \u0027pathetic cowardice\u0027 and demanded Labour join a no confidence vote to collapse the government, while Conservative MP Nick Boles jibed: \u0027Nothing has changed, right?\u0027 The new timings are unclear, but under the EU Withdrawal Act the government must lay out its plans to Parliament by January 21 at the latest. Mrs May is making what could be an agonising statement to MPs later this afternoon.There are also some doubts about whether Mrs May will be able to shelve the vote, with some Tory Brexiteers and Remainers vowing to try and force a ision anyway. No10 insists no vote will be necessary to put off the showdown.  A climbdown will allow Mrs May to avoid catastrophic defeat, and go back to Brussels to try to get more concessions. But it would also demonstrate how low her authority has sunk.The EU has also flatly dismissed the idea that there could be substantive concessions on the orce package, with Irish PM Leo Varadkar insisting it is \u0027not possible\u0027 to change the deal. Brexit brawl hurts Britain, says RUTH SUNDERLAND, with our...Share this article    European Court of Justice judge Carl Gustav Fernlund read out the ruling on Article 50 at the court in Luxembourg today (pictured) EU judges delivered a boost for Remainer rebels today by ruling that Britain can unilaterally cancel Brexit. The European Court of Justice decided that Article 50 can be withdrawn by the UK without permission from other member states.Britain would keep its current terms of membership if it quit the process - meaning keeping the rebate, the opt out from the Euro and exemptions from the Schengen passport-free zone.Today\u0027s ruling will encourage hopes from pro-EU MPs that a second referendum can be held to stop the UK from leaving the bloc altogether. But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the ruling was \u0027irrelevant\u0027 as it was \u0027certainly not the intention of the government\u0027 to delay Brexit. The case was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.                                                      He gave a clear indication that the government is seeking concessions from the EU, saying there was \u0027no-one better placed\u0027 than Mrs May to get more concessions.But he warned there were significant \u0027risks\u0027 in reopening the Withdrawal Agreement thrashed out with Brussels, including France seeking more access to fishing waters and Spain troublemaking over Gibraltar.Mr Gove dismissed suggestions that Mrs May could be helped in her efforts by a heavy defeat in Parliament. In a reference to the famous resignation speech by Geoffrey Howe that sunk Margaret Thatcher, he warned that would be the \u0027equivalent of breaking the cricket bat in half before the leader went to the crease\u0027. \u0027If colleagues really want to help the PM I\u0027m sure the PM would urge them gently but firmly to support her tomorrow,\u0027 Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom is due to make a statement to MPs after Mrs May addresses them this afternoon - which could give an indication of how long the vote has been put off.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will also make a separate statement later tonight, on the Article 50 ruling by the ECJ. DUP leader Arlene Foster said this afternoon: \u0027Just finished a call with the Prime Minister. My message was clear. \u0027The backstop must go. Too much time has been wasted. Need a better deal. Disappointed it has taken so long for Prime Minister to listen.\u0027 To drop the vote tomorrow, Mrs May might need to win a vote of MPs tonight on changing the business.Some of her MPs are already suggesting they could vote against a delay – raising the prospect of her being humiliatingly forced into holding it.Brexiteer and arch May critic James Duddridge warned she could not just delay a vote.He said: \u0027The House will have to vote to pull a vote. I will oppose.\u0027We need to see this deal off once and for all.\u0027Remain supporter and former minister Philip Lee said pulling the vote would \u0027just delay the inevitable\u0027 because Brussels will not give concessions.He tweeted: \u0027Actual choice before Parliament is between a People\u0027s Vote or a No Deal Brexit.\u0027Let\u0027s get on with making that decision.\u0027 Mrs May spoke with EU council president Mr Tusk last night as she considers a bid to squeeze more concessions out of the EU.      The decision drew derision from critics, including Tory MP Nick Boles - who has been pushing for a \u0027Norway plus\u0027 outcome from the Brexit processAn EU summit is scheduled for the end of the week, which could provide a stage for Mrs May to emulate Margaret Thatcher and have a \u0027handbag moment\u0027 to demand more concessions on the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027. After the vote on the Brexit deal was postponed, children\u0027s minister Nadhim Zahawi tweeted: \u0027@theresa_may has listened to colleagues and will head to Brussels to push back on the backstop.\u0027 But Ireland\u0027s deputy PM Simon Coveney today delivered a savage blow by dismissing her chances of getting fresh concessions on Brexit. He insisted the deal is \u0027not going to change\u0027. In a clear leadership pitch yesterday, Mr Johnson  predicted that Mrs May would lose her crunch vote on the deal by a huge margin.Looking visibly emotional as he appeared on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show, he said the UK can do \u0027much much better\u0027 than the PM\u0027s deal.There have been claims that Home Secretary Sajid Javid is also brazenly canvassing Cabinet colleagues for a tilt at the top job if Mrs May is ousted. Aides insisted he is focused on helping the PM get her deal through.In a sign of what could be a torrent of resignations if and when she goes ahead with the vote, Tory MP Will Quince yesterday quit as a parliamentary aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.At least two government whips were understood to be considering falling on their swords in order to vote against the Brexit package. Mrs May\u0027s position was further undermined today when the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally halt the Brexit process by withdrawing Article 50.The judgement that permission is not needed was hailed by Remainers as opening the door to holding a second referendum. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in Brussels for regular talks with counterparts this morning, said the government has no intention of reversing Article 50 and voters would be \u0027shocked\u0027 if it did. Senior ministers including David Lidington and David Gauke are said to be in talks with Labour over whether a second referendum or a Norway-style deal would break the deadlock.    Mr Gove dismissed suggestions that Mrs May could be helped in her efforts by a heavy defeat in ParliamenSir Alan was on air on BBC\u0027s Politics Live programme as the news of the Brexit delay emerged - risking controversy by laughing as he was told the government was in chaos. Appearing on Radio 4 earlier, he claimed his Tory colleagues lining up to oppose Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal had not \u0027thought strategically enough about what the consequences of that would be\u0027.\u0027The first is that even if they overturn it they are not necessarily going to get an alternative which they are campaigning for, and instead what they will probably do is set in train a course of events which could lead to chaos in many, many areas,\u0027 he told the Today programme.He warned there could be a leadership contest, or a general election, and said the UK could be \u0027top dog in Europe at the moment when France is burning and Germany is in transition\u0027 but instead \u0027we\u0027re just beating ourselves up\u0027.Sir Alan also said Tory former foreign secretary Boris Johnson would be \u0027met with a very, very loud raspberry in many, many different languages\u0027 if he walked into a negotiating room in Brussels.And he warned: \u0027What I really resent is the glee some people have in wanting to oppose this, and then in jostling for their own personal gain. This is contemptible. \u0027Let\u0027s be absolutely clear that if this goes pear-shaped in the way that it really could, on the back of people opposing the deal that is on offer tomorrow night, the wreckers in history will forever be known as the wreckers.\u0027Mr Dodds said: \u0027This vote has been pulled because it would have been overwhelmingly defeated. Deferring the vote is only of any use if the Government is prepared to go to Brussels and insist on necessary changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. \u0027Few people accepted this was the best deal available and the Prime Minister\u0027s actions today prove that.\u0027 Mutinous Tories are furious at her deal\u0027s Irish backstop plan, which would see the UK tied to the customs union and more single market checks have to be carried out in Northern Ireland.They warn the UK cannot pull out of the backstop without the EU\u0027s permission - potentially keeping the UK \u0027locked\u0027 to Brussels against its will.Amid mounting opposition to the deal, civil servants have war-gamed two versions of the UK holding another referendum.The first is a straight choice between the PM\u0027s deal and remaining in the EU, and the second would be a leave, remain contest with a  second question asking them if they prefer the existing deal or a no-deal departure on World Trade Organisation terms, The Sunday Times reported.  If Mrs May loses an immediate no-confidence vote tomorrow, Parliament could have to sit on Christmas Day because the Fixed Term Parliament Act sets a deadline of 14 calendar days for a new Government to be formed, meaning December 25 would be the last chance for any coalition to try to win a Commons majority. It\u0027s believed that the last time the Commons sat on Christmas Day was in 1656.    If these are Theresa May\u0027s final days in Downing Street, she seems remarkably sanguine about it, drinking from a mug which says \u0027proud to be a Bloody Difficult Woman\u0027 and using a hole punch which read \u0027please do not remove from office\u0027     Boris Johnson is the bookies\u0027 favourite to take over if the Brexit chaos forces Theresa May out of Downing Street There is the prospect of large scale resignations if Mrs May does press ahead - with at least two government whips understood to be among those contemplating quitting.In a flavour of what could come, Tory MP Will Quince yesterday quit as a parliamentary aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.  Senior Conservatives also warn that a no-confidence vote in Mrs May\u0027s leadership is inevitable if she does not back down before the vote. Mr Javid has reportedly begun to build a team of ministers to support his bid to become the first non-white Prime Minister, ahead of Tuesday\u0027s crunch Brexit deal vote in Parliament.  Aides played down the claims, insisting he is focused on helping the PM get her deal through. Mr Javid\u0027s supporters are believed to include Liz Truss - who last week was overhead telling a friend that Mr Javid had to be ready to take over. Mr Johnson, meanwhile, also hinted at a possible leadership bid after outlining his plans for another negotiation with the EU.                                                     "},{"url":null,"title":"David Beckham wannabe spent 33 000 trying look like hero","story":"Jack Johnson, 22, of Kimberley, Nottinghamshire, spent 24 hours in a coma being treated for smoke inhalation after his one-bedroom flat went up in flamesThe incident happened on Thursday, November 8, and has left Jack, who is currently unemployed, having to sofa surf between friends and family.Mr Johnson, who calls himself Jack Beckham online, had decided to fry some potato waffles in a chip pan but dozed off while looking on social media.Meet the dumpster-ing granny: Frugal grandmother, 63, has...How to complete ALL your Christmas shopping in 30 minutes:...Share this articleHe woke to find his flat covered in smoke, with flames spreading from the kitchen to the bathroom and landing.

The man alleged to have committed the offence is obscured in this picture, which shows a number of other Chelsea fans jeering the player Chelsea fan Nathan Lewis, who is black, was standing a few seats away from the men abusing Sterling.Although Lewis did not hear any racism during the match, he was shocked by the television footage, describing it as \u0027quite scary\u0027.\u0027A lot of people have been questioning me and my integrity as to why I didn\u0027t get involved, why I didn\u0027t react.

He\u0027s got no regard for me, Sterling either.\u0027To see that happen on TV just a few feet away from me is quite scary.\u0027The England star put on a brave face as he was photographed leaving his club\u0027s training ground in a black Mercedes 4x4 yesterday afternoon. Sterling was interviewed by members of the Metropolitan Police on Sunday, who travelled north as part of their investigation into an incident during Manchester City\u0027s match with Chelsea. He confirmed to police he had heard racist insults and other foul language as he went to collect a ball for a corner near the Matthew Harding Stand. Some of the biggest names in the world of football have praised the footballer. Viv Anderson, the first black footballer to play for England, wrote in the Daily Mail today: \u0027Raheem Sterling laughed in the face of those who he says racially abused him at Chelsea. What a powerful thing that was to see. It was the way those of us who have known discrimination have been dealing with it for years\u0027.Former Manchester United captain Rio Ferdinand suggested that footballers in England should be inspired by Colin Kaepernick\u0027s kneeling gesture and launch their own bid to fight back against racism after this latest worrying incident.Twitter users highlighted a first-half incident when a supporter at Stamford Bridge appeared to mouth the phrase \u0027f****** black c***\u0027 towards Sterling as he collected the ball in front of a section of Chelsea fans. Pictures of the moment and a video widely circulated on social media appeared to confirm this, with one spectator allegedly making the racist comment amid a barrage of aggressive abuse from Chelsea fans towards Sterling.    Pundit and former Manchester United captain Rio Ferdinand expressed his disgust online on Saturday evening Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright tweeted: \u0027The bad old days are back\u0027 and \u0027absolutely no doubt about what he says\u0027      Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out later issued a statement following the incident  at Stamford BridgeHere is the Kick It Out statement in full: \u0027What happened at Chelsea shows what is still going on in football.\u0027Where is (Premier League executive chairman) Richard Scudamore? Where is (FA chairman) Greg Clarke? Where is Chelsea\u0027s chairman (Bruce Buck)?

We have already made comments about the way Raheem Sterling has been treated differently by the media. The print media often targets not just black players, but all footballers.\u0027Raheem Sterling has received bad press over the last few years because of his lifestyle, and clearly there are issues from potential stories adding to prejudice and I have every sympathy for him. Players know if they are abused in any way they have to tell the referee. It was awful. All players know the referee is in charge and has a duty of care, and the referee can remove those people. It didn\u0027t appear to me he told the referee in the first place.                                                     \u0027Regarding what was said at the Chelsea game as you can see by my reaction I just had to laugh because I don\u0027t expect no better.\u0027Sterling also said that he believed black players and white players were not treated equally by the media, including the Daily Mail and MailOnline, and that he believes this helps \u0027fuel racism and aggressive behaviour.\u0027 A Chelsea spokesman said: \u0027We\u0027re aware of reports and video footage. We will investigate the matter and take the strongest possible action where necessary.\u0027 A Football Association statement read: \u0027We take all allegations of discrimination extremely seriously and will work with the clubs and the relevant authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with appropriately.\u0027We strongly condemn all forms of discrimination and encourage all fans and participants who believe that they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report it through the appropriate channels: The FA, our County FAs or our partners Kick It Out.\u0027 The Met Police said: \u0027We are aware of a video circulating online in which it is claimed racial abuse was allegedly directed at a player at a Chelsea v Manchester City game at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, December 8.\u0027We will review the footage to determine whether any offences have been committed.\u0027No arrests have been made, the Met added. Should any offence have been made, a life ban could be handed to the supporter or supporters responsible.Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out later issued a statement, which read: \u0027We\u0027ve received reports from a variety of sources about an incident of alleged racist abuse at the Chelsea-Manchester City game.\u0027We will forward those to Chelsea and offer our support in their investigation.\u0027Yet another great day of football damaged by prejudice.\u0027Do you know the man in the video?

Both are produced by Marvel Comics, the rival of DC Comics.  The film debuted in China on December 7 ahead of the U.S. The director James Wan, leading actor Jason Momoa and leading actress Amber Heard promoted the film in Beijing last month          Jason Momoa (left) takes selfies with fans during an event ahead of the \u0027Aquaman\u0027 movie\u0027s world premiere in Beijing in November. The film is seeing a huge success in the countryGenerally speaking, films based on characters from Marvel Comics, including Spider-man, Ironman and Captain America, perform better in box office in China.But Aquaman, the king of the seven seas, might well turn the tide. With an estimated production budget of $200 million (£157.4 million), \u0027Aquaman\u0027 has yielded a new opening-weekend record for DC Comics as well as its parent company Warner Bros in China.Interestingly, the country has its own underwater deity, the Dragon King under East Sea, in its ancient mythology.           Director James Wan\u0027s Chinese background has partially contributed to the success of the film.

Australian James Wan (温子仁) was born in Malaysia to a Chinese immigrant family.           DC Comics\u0027s \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 grossed 610 million yuan (£69.7 million) in China last year          In comparison, \u0027Justice League\u0027 brought in 690 million yuan (£78.8 million) in China          China is expected to overtake North America to be the world\u0027s largest film market by 2020Chinese media have raved about 41-year-old Wan, praising his talent and the fact that someone with Chinese heritage has become a top-notch director in Hollywood. Mr Wan has expressed his gratitude to the Chinese market on Twitter. He wrote in a post yesterday: \u0027Thank you China, for the tremendous word-of-mouth.\u0027 \u0027Aquaman\u0027 will expand to 40 international countries next week. It will arrive in the UK on December 14 and in North American theaters on December 21. "},{"url":null,"title":"Network Rail admits major works taking place routes","story":"    All routes between Victoria and Clapham Junction will be closed over Christmas and New Year, London Paddington will suffer the same fate on December 23, 24 and 30.\u0027Who would have guessed the first day would be an utter...Can you spot what\u0027s wrong with this photo?

After the break for the tea, the band was at it again, finishing ‘I Wanna Be Your Man,’ and the recording session ended up at around 11pm, according to the book.‘My father really enjoyed working with The Beatles, (recognizing) their enormous talent,’ Simon Parkinson said in the book. Norman Parkinson died in 1990. The photos he took that September day first appeared in ‘Queen,’ the magazine, and then for ‘The Beatles Book,’ a 40-page glossy magazine published in early 1964. Journalist Maureen Cleave provided the text for the glossy, and in 1966 she would interview Lennon when he said the group was ‘more popular than Jesus now.’Not long after that September photo shoot, The Beatles earned their second number 1 hit with ‘Love Me Do,’ and Beatlemania was born.

He thinks the world has forgotten what human rights mean, which is why he has designed a new flag The wallpaper image on Ai Weiwei’s mobile phone is a black and white photograph showing the entrance to an underground home in Xinjiang. It was here where the Chinese activist artist and his family were exiled for five years when he was a boy. “We were put underground here as a punishment,” he says. “This is where I grew up. Now they put the Uighurs in these kind of camps.” He enlarges the picture showing a bunker-like structure jutting out of the ground in an arid, inhospitable landscape.Ai’s father, Ai Qing, was a poet and political radical who, although no activist, was seen as a threat to society. “So I’ve always been involved with human rights issues, not initially out of choice but out of personal experience,” he says.Many of Ai’s works over a career ning more than 40 years have been investigations into human rights transgressions, including his own imprisonment by Chinese authorities. But now he has taken his interest a step further by accepting the invitation from UK arts organisations and human rights charities to design a flag to mark the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.“I don’t recall any kind of symbol for human rights,” he says, sitting at a long wooden table in his studio in Berlin, where he has lived in exile since 2015. “So it was time we gave it one.”He lays out a series of photographs. They show the muddy footprints of Rohingya refugees who have been forced to flee attacks by Myanmarese soldiers and take refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.“These are the footprints of some of the barefooted children, women and young people who we met, who had no shoes,” he says. “Of course it’s very difficult to design something to illustrate such a large, abstract concept. But I thought a footprint relates to everybody who has been forced to flee, whether in Africa, Afghanistan or Bangladesh. There is nothing more human than a footprint.”The mud-prints have morphed into several versions of a white footprint on a blue background, which form the basis of Ai’s flag. The design is set to be released on 10 December, and UK schools, police forces, faith groups and hospitals will be invited to fly it from their buildings during a seven-day campaign in June.Ai believes that the effects of globalisation have eroded a common understanding of human rights. “Less and less people now talk about human rights since the end of the cold war. They use words like common values instead, so as not to offend the Chinese authorities with whom they want to do business. Increasingly, people are even viewing human rights in a negative way.”“People in Britain and elsewhere in the better-off world fail to grasp that the way they live can affect the way people elsewhere in the world live,” he continues. “iPhones are made in China because that country joined the capitalism game and plays it very well. But those who make the phones have no basic rights and are modern slaves who end up jumping out of factory windows. People who buy the phones have to have more of a sense of responsibility and engagement.”Ai took his nine-year-old son with him on a recent trip to Bangladesh – about which he is making a film – just as he has to other investigations, such as to Mexico, to investigate the 43 students who disappeared in a single day in 2014.“He’s been with me to visit most refugee camps I’ve been to, as well as the poorest ghettos in Mexico, and cartel areas, the island of Lesbos in Greece. I don’t want to teach him anything, but by being exposed to this kind of information he has developed a basic sensitivity of what’s right or wrong. And he sees me arguing a lot with people.”That morning, the argument was with a Berlin taxi driver on the way to taking his son to school, who told Ai to shut off his mobile phone – he was listening to a message from his mother – because it interfered with the music he was playing on his radio. “He told me to get out of the car, and when I said I wouldn’t he slammed on the brakes and we all fell forward. My son hit his head. He used his vehicle on a public street to express his anger”.“So you see I am fighting battles wherever I go – including with German people who say I should be grateful to them because I am a refugee, and they paid for my life. This is the mood in Germany right now, the posters I see in the streets saying: ‘We can make our own babies, we don’t need foreigners.’ It’s the mood in much of Europe, including the UK. It’s very scary because this kind of moment is a reflection of the 1930s.”He is angry and confused about experiencing this sort of hostility in Germany, the country that gave him refuge. He took the first available opportunity to thank its chancellor, Angela Merkel, for her involvement in his release.“I met her by chance in the Chinese restaurant I go to, which is very close to her flat and where we’ve seen each other several times since. I shook her hand and as it was my birthday she congratulated me. I thanked her for all the effort her government made to bring me out. They were really very supportive.”Ai’s 4,000m2 studio is 46 steps, or 10 metres, below ground in a former brewery in the north of Berlin. The decision to be subterranean is a very deliberate one, he says. “In my New York studio, I’m also underground. I feel like I have special protection. I have spent years being discriminated against, under surveillance, followed by people undercover, which makes you feel you’re not part of society and you need your own corner. Having once been a way of suppressing my family, being underground has become something positive to me. I need the solitude to work. I need to be separated. It’s a form of self-protection.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff63757c1529e7f67459303806d4e24dde37df6/0_211_2180_1308/master/2180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f69e667c4cd1ec6d28281429889489d","title":"andrew moisey american fraternity photographer college behaviour","story":"Photographer Andrew Moisey uncovered ritual hazing, extreme drunkenness and toxic masculinity on one college campus – from men destined to be America’s future leadersLast year in the US, four freshman students died as a direct result of hazing rituals during college fraternity initiation ceremonies. All the deaths occurred during or just after drinking bouts in which the victims consumed vast amounts of spirits in a short space of time while older students egged them on. One of the deceased, Maxwell Gruver, 19, a student at Louisiana State University, was found to have had a blood-alcohol level over .49 gdl at the time of his death – just .31 is considered life-threatening.“Nobody can physically drink that much ... You have to be forced to drink it,” his mother told ABC news. “It’s senseless. I mean, how is making your brother do all these things, and humiliating somebody, a brotherhood?”In his book True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America’s Fraternities, John Hechinger notes that around 100,000 young men choose to be initiated into chapters annually, despite these all-male societies now being associated with what he describes as “the unholy trinity of fraternity life: racism, deadly drinking and misogyny”. Many of the young men they attract will go on to work in politics, finance and law-making, sometimes at the highest level. What’s more, the loyalties formed will be maintained throughout a working life in which the male, white and privileged look out for each other whatever their transgressions. Hechinger cites a fraternity promotional video that promises students a lifelong bond with “the best and brightest men on campus. Men who will become the best men at your wedding, pallbearers at your funeral and everything in between.”There is a funeral in Andrew Moisey’s timely and provocative photobook, The American Fraternity: An Illustrated Ritual Manual, though it is unrelated to anything that happened on the campus of the unnamed university where the images were documented. It does, though, show young men looking awkwardly ill at ease as they attend the most serious ritual of all. Elsewhere, the same young men seem altogether more relaxed in a closed, all-male campus environment where heavy drinking, boorishness, bullying and misogyny are the norms. A world in which homosexuality is taboo but cross-dressing and semi-naked wrestling are acceptable and parading your penis and testicles is almost de rigueur.“I wanted to show how the whole brotherhood thing that fraternity houses are built on actually tends to bring out the worst in young men, and the lofty ideals that once informed the organisations have now been replaced by pretty dreadful behaviour,” elaborates Moisey, who studied at Berkeley and now teaches at Cornell. “But I also wanted to get over the fact that, though these guys love to revel in their own debauchery, they don’t think of themselves as bad people.”Moisey, whose older brother was a member of the frat house in the book, began photographing there in 2008, when George W Bush, “the ultimate frat guy”, was president. “I was angry with Bush and the culture of white privilege that produced him and his values, but no one was that interested in the pictures. But now, suddenly it’s 2018 and the temperature has changed.”The book offers an uncomfortable glimpse of an enclosed world whose ultra-macho values have been sanctioned by the election of bully-in-chief Donald Trump, and his subsequent endorsement of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh. Interestingly, of the 18 presidents listed as ex-fraternity members in the book – including Kennedy, Reagan, Clinton and Bush – Trump is conspicuous by his absence. Kavanaugh, though, is included on the corresponding list of Supreme Court judges, even though the book went to the printers before his controversial confirmation. “I took a calculated risk on that one and it paid off,” says Moisey. “Out of a fraternity culture that protects bad seeds, one of the worst seeds gets elected to the Supreme Court.”The American Fraternity is a beautifully complex undertaking: the photobook as art object, conceptually mirroring an old fraternity handbook complete with pledges, prayers, vows and descriptions of the secretive rituals and rules that bind members for life. Hence images of excess and humiliation are contrasted with the grandly titled, quasi Masonic ceremonies that lend contemporary fraternity houses a historical legitimacy: the Ritual of Initiation, the Libations, the Candle Ceremony, Duties of the Chapter Orders. There are many disturbing visual echoes, including a grainy photograph of hooded inductees being humiliated that recalls images of prisoners being degraded at Abu Ghraib. Elsewhere, obviously distressed and inebriated young men are cajoled to drink more by older students with predictable results – retching, puking and unconsciousness. Aggression and humiliation are the norms here, the one driving the other.“Why are the girls there?” asks writer Cynthia Robinson in her edgy, questioning afterword. “Why did they go, why do they, to these parties where everyone knows what happens?” She then provides, from personal experience, an uncomfortable answer. “Let me tell you why, because I was there too. A sheltered southern girl eager to bust out, I was a frat-house regular by the end of my first semester. I passed out in frat houses too. Lots of girls did ... I was there because I wanted reassurance on a certain score: that I could be a certain thing, be a certain way. The girls in the images that comprise this book are there for the same reasons. They are there in order to reassure themselves, to perform for their peers, that they are desirable. Desired. This they want above all other things: to be desired.”Moisey’s black and white photographs move from portraiture to reportage to a low-lit style that is close to surveillance photography – some rituals are carried out in candlelight. Throughout, he is a detached observer, showing the unruly ordinariness of all-male campus dorm life – untidy bedrooms, filthy kitchens, graffiti-scrawled doors – alongside the debauchery and excess. The fraternity even has a pet dog, which seems to roam freely through the rooms and, in one awful image, is held by one drunken guy while being punched by another. Everything, it seems, is permitted in pursuit of this almost feral male camaraderie.“These all-male campus spaces have been around since the 1820s,” elaborates Moisey, “but they changed perceptibly during the so-called culture wars of the 1970s, becoming a safe space for guys who didn’t want to have to worry about having their kind of fun.” Many fraternities, he believes, now view themselves as embattled institutions, maintaining their conservative core values of brotherhood, privilege and machismo against a perceived liberal onslaught. Disturbingly, the code of loyalty to the brotherhood endures even after the other principles of fraternity life have long since fallen away.“The central issue is that there is an allegiance to everyone inside the fraternity rather than to the higher ideal,” says Moisey. “So even though most of these guys consider themselves highly respectable, their loyalty is such that they will protect the bad guys who hide in their midst. If you are a bad seed and you join a fraternity, you have found your safe haven. And what we are seeing right now is that the support and protection that fraternities provide for the bad seeds extends into the highest echelons of American power and decision-making.”The last image in the book shows a row of frat guys looking at a spread of Moisey’s photographs. They seem unconcerned, even amused, by what they depict. “I didn’t set out to expose them,” says Moisey, “I just wanted to show what hadn’t been shown before. And when I showed it to them, they were fine. As far as they are concerned, they’re just ordinary American guys doing what ordinary American guys do at college.”Revealingly, though, when Moisey first exhibited the work in a small show in Berkeley, it was his artist’s statement that drew the most media attention. It read: “This is what our leaders looked like when they were young.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edfa8f39096804c8359e5285c095011faaa92984/0_0_3508_2768/master/3508.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc14831cd9ea0fb10f2a74150ee4f629","title":"cryptocurrencies bitcoin kenneth rogoff","story":"The likes of bitcoin may well be worthless – but there’s a chance they will be valuable somedayAt a recent conference I attended, the overwhelming sentiment was that market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies could explode over the next five years, rising to $5-10tn (£4-8tn). For those who watched the price of bitcoin go from $13 in December 2012 to roughly $4,000 today, this year’s drop from $20,000 was no reason to panic.It is tempting to say, “Of course the price is collapsing.” Regulators are gradually waking up to the fact that they cannot countenance large expensive-to-trace transaction technologies that facilitate tax evasion and criminal activity. At the same time, central banks from Sweden to China are realising that they, too, can issue digital currencies. As I emphasised in my 2016 book on the past, present, and future of currency, when it comes to new forms of money, the private sector may innovate, but in due time the government regulates and appropriates.But as I also pointed out back then, just because the long-term value of bitcoin is more likely to be $100 than $100,000 does not necessarily mean that it definitely should be worth zero. The right way to think about cryptocurrency coins is as lottery tickets that pay off in a dystopian future where they are used in rogue and failed states, or perhaps in countries where citizens have already lost all semblance of privacy. It is no coincidence that dysfunctional Venezuela is the first issuer of a state-backed cryptocurrency (the “petro”).The ultimate obstacle for any cryptocurrency is that eventually there has to be a way to buy a range of goods and services beyond illicit drugs and hit men. And if governments ever make it illegal to use coins in retail stores and banks, their value must ultimately collapse.Many crypto-evangelists insist that bitcoin is “digital gold,” in part because the long-term supply is algorithmically capped at 21 million. But this is nutty. For one thing, unlike gold – which has always had other purposes and today is employed widely in new technologies from iPhones to spacecraft – bitcoin has no alternative use. And even if bitcoiners manage to find a way to lower the phenomenal energy cost of verifying transactions, the very nature of decentralised ledger systems makes them vastly less efficient than systems with a trusted central party like a central bank. Take away near-anonymity and no one will want to use it keep it and advanced-economy governments will not tolerate it.The evangelists dismiss such concerns: bitcoin can still be incredibly valuable as long as enough people perceive it as digital gold. After all, they argue, money is a social convention. But economists (including me) who have worked on this kind of problem for five decades have found that price bubbles surrounding intrinsically worthless assets must eventually burst. The prices of assets that do have real underlying value cannot deviate arbitrarily far from historical benchmarks. And government-issued money is hardly a pure social convention governments pay employees and suppliers, and demand tax payments in fiat currency.But it is too soon to say how the new world of digital currencies will play out. Central banks will get into the game (their reserves are already a form of wholesale digital currency), but that is not the end of the story. US Treasury Direct, for example, already offers retail customers an extremely low-cost way to hold very short-term Treasury debt for amounts as little as $100, tradable to others in the system. Still, heavy security makes the system relatively cumbersome to use, and just maybe governments might adopt one of today’s private digital technologies.For the moment, the real question is if and when global regulation will stamp out privately constructed systems that are expensive for governments to trace and monitor. Any single large advanced economy foolish enough to try to embrace cryptocurrencies, as Japan did last year, risks becoming a global destination for money-laundering. (Japan’s subsequent moves to distance itself from cryptocurrencies were perhaps one cause of this year’s gyrations.) In the end, advanced economies will surely coordinate on cryptocurrency regulation, as they have on other measures to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.But that leaves out a lot of disgruntled players. After all, many today – including Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Russia – are labouring under US financial sanctions. Their governments will not necessarily care about global externalities if they encourage cryptocurrencies that might have value as long as they are used somewhere.So, while we shouldn’t be surprised by this year’s cryptocurrency price bust, the price of these coins is not necessarily zero. Like lottery tickets, there is a high probability that they are worthless. There is also an extremely small outside chance that they will be worth a great deal someday, for reasons that currently are difficult to anticipate.• Kenneth Rogoff is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University.

Nowhere is this truer than in cities where, increasingly, we live on top of each other in ever-denser spaces and no one captures the resultant moments of friction better than Liana Finck. The New Yorker cartoonist has accumulated a loyal following for her line drawings conveying – in unpretentious, quivering pen strokes – all the micro-aggressions and anxieties that navigating a city provokes.In fact, she says by phone from New York, her trademark style – that can just as effectively convey apprehension or bristling anger – is derived from drawing on the subway. “That’s where my signature wiggly lines come from. A subway helps me not fake them.”While her new graphic memoir, Passing for Human, centres on family, the single panel vignettes she posts on Instagram reflect her observations of urban life and how its etiquette is breached or upheld. “I think it inspires my Instagram drawings because I use those mostly to figure out things that are bothering me and make sense of them. I know that every city must have a different flavour of micro-aggression, but I have a feeling that New York must be worse than others.”Finck’s keen observation of human behaviour reflects acute awareness – to the point of self-consciousness – of her own. She regularly draws in cafes, not out of necessity but because the quiet of her studio is not conducive to work. It is clearly a rich seam of complicated feelings for her. “I feel a lot of shame about it, I don’t know why. I feel like it’s rude to spend longer than a couple of hours in a cafe. I feel bad when baristas start recognising me, like some weird eccentric.“The point is to get your coffee, give them your business, and then get out and let someone else buy something. I hate when there’s not enough tables and there’s people quietly fighting for them.”Many of the misbehaviours (she calls them “micro-unkindnesses”) that catch her attention are fleeting and, some might say, inconsequential – like someone intruding on your space in a packed elevator or the “pedestrian rage” directed at slow walkers. Somewhat ironically, it’s those drawings that draw the most negative response on Instagram. “People who don’t live in cities think I’m being so mean,” she says.“I guess it’s the same thing they don’t like in Larry David – like, ‘why am I being so needlessly mean spirited’? It seems like I’m nitpicking, like I’m choosing this tiny thing that annoys me and blowing this thing out of proportion instead of seeing the bigger picture.”But Finck frames it as “noticing how civilisation works” – moments when the urban fabric is momentarily pulled taut. If you do not pay these trivial transgressions any mind, it may be because city living fosters – maybe demands – a certain obliviousness, a thicker skin. But not everyone develops it.“Sometimes I feel like a person who notices these things in a world of blind people who don’t,” says Finck, the sound of car horns faintly audible in the background. “We’re just putting away our bodies, packing them in the most efficient way possible, while our minds can go anywhere.”If you’re an illustrator or graphic artist with an idea for the illustrated city series, email us at cities@theFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76bfaf9acac0b272fedfe76b48922c56a5f07d9a/0_287_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d386091ff4a1568bddadabea7b3d2b","title":"brexit riots france","story":"It’s the latest alternative ‘project fear’ from hard Brexiters – unrest in the event of a parliamentary impasse. But it’s unlikelyCould France happen here? There seems no desperation to which hard Brexiters will not turn in alternative “project fear”. Yes, feelings are running high. Yes, people on both sides will feel lied to and cheated, whatever the outcome when some deal is finally reached. But rioting down Regent Street, punch-ups in Parliament Square, tanks on the Thames bridges? I think not.Emmanuel Macron’s attempts radically to reform his arthritic economy were always going to be tough. Nicolas Sarkozy attempted the same neo-Thatcherite programme and encountered the same crisis of authority. France’s labour relations, its entrenched interests and its deep ide between far-right populists and the old elite, have created fault lines across which there is little debate. France is even more polarised than Britain. Its assembly lacks the raucous unreliability of Britain’s Commons. Its media lacks ersity. It has always seemed to lack the conduits of compromise.Throughout France’s history, its political crises have been enacted on the streets of Paris, to the glee of revolutionaries everywhere. From the turmoils of the 18th and 19th centuries to the demise of Charles de Gaulle after 1968, a mystique has attached to the barricade and the molotov cocktail, the burning car and the charging riot police. Last week, Macron read the runes on the Arc de Triomphe and capitulated. He negotiated with riot leaders.There would undoubtedly be a strong, and justified, reaction to a decision of parliament simply to ignore the referendum result (as happened in France in 2005, with no riots). There might be anger at a referendum rerun, though voters could hardly complain if offered the option of the same outcome. It would be implausible to see violence arising from parliament performing its duty, to interpret the referendum result as it sees fit in the national interest.Britain remains deeply ided – on Brexit as on many other things. But few people outside the wilder shores of the Tory party really want “no deal”. The art of politics is that of compromise, and the compromises that must surround the UK’s formal withdrawal from the EU, whatever the fall-back, were always going to be tortuous and nitpicking. When a deal is reached, as it will be, the reaction on the streets will not be burnt cars and smashed windows. It will be a giant sigh of relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36638656c7e81adddd91dfe05f3f0994cdc36383/0_270_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0caf5e0a5ab39de54cf1399ee857e0d","title":"country pay price may brexit vote delay no deal","story":"When Lord Salisbury said that “delay is life”, he was voicing a doctrine of conservatism that sought to hold back the tides of change for as long as possible. But the phrase has another value, expressing an enduring truth about political tactics: for a politician under pressure, delay is a vital friend.Which is why Theresa May’s decision to delay the meaningful vote scheduled for 7pm on Tuesday evening should hardly come as a surprise. She was faced with a choice between guaranteed defeat, with scores of her own MPs in open rebellion, or the possibility, however remote, that something might come along in the next few days to get her out of that jam. The survival instinct of most politicians, perhaps even most human beings, would always be to swap certain disaster now for the uncertain possibility of something less bad later on. And that is what May has done.She may still, eventually, suffer a crushing defeat on her Brexit withdrawal plan, followed by Tory MPs bringing a motion of no confidence in her as Conservative leader or a vote of no confidence in her government tabled by the opposition or both. All those things might happen. It’s just the prospect of them is now not as immediate as it was. She has bought herself some time.But it has come at a steep price. First, she has taken an axe to the already broken credibility of herself and her hapless government. A matter of hours after her senior ministers were on the radio insisting the vote would go ahead, she has made them (and therefore herself) look like liars or fools by reversing that decision. Put it alongside May’s flat insistence in her first year as prime minister that she would not call an early election, only to break her word by calling a snap election for June 2017. From now on, all her firm declarations and solemn vows will be dismissed as hollow, empty words. Perhaps she’s not going to remain in Downing Street long enough for this to matter. But her credibility is shot.The second price will not be paid solely by her or her party, but rather by the country. For Britain needed the catharsis of Tuesday’s vote. Not for therapeutic reasons, but rather to begin the process of escape from the Brexit quagmire. The vote would have been the first stage in a much-needed process of elimination, whereby MPs would begin to confront the various options and eliminate them one by one.May would have been defeated. Labour might then have tried, as they have promised, to bring down the government and trigger a general election. That effort would almost certainly have failed. And then the Commons could have got on with the serious business of assessing the Norway-plus scenario and a second referendum, eliminating one or the other until finally a last option was left standing.Now that process is itself delayed. Which means MPs are leaving themselves too little time. Remember, if the clock runs out and no plan has been voted on and agreed to by parliament, then the UK simply crashes out of the EU with no deal on 29 March 2019 – with all the economic and social calamity that that entails. That is the default. That’s what will happen unless MPs can forge a consensus around an alternative action. And now they have less time to find it.So I don’t blame the Tory MP, a former ally of the prime minister’s, who texted me to say May’s delay “looks shabby and defensive, and as if all that matters is the PM’s own survival”. She has chosen delay to save her own political life. But the country has taken another step towards the precipice. And we are running out of time to find our way back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d4e584bd8d1a81a796341ddeeaeaf42427de73f/0_304_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=043c50865248e4a28cae4e35e2cd6438","title":"priti patel brexit ignorance ireland vote uk","story":"Priti Patel’s appalling comment about using food shortages to pressurise Ireland in the Brexit negotiations showed a breathtaking ignorance of history. However, while the boorishness of her remark is in a category of its own, misunderstanding Ireland has become a common feature of public discourse in the UK.“Backstop” was listed by the Collins Dictionary recently as one of the new or notable words of 2018. It defines “backstop” as a system that will come into effect if no other arrangement is made. The concept became so current in the context of solving the Brexit Northern Ireland conundrum that negotiators came to talk comfortably about a “backstop to the backstop”.

The two years since the Brexit referendum have witnessed a startling decline in the capacity of many in London to understand Ireland.I can testify from four decades of working with British colleagues on EU issues, that our shared membership of the EU developed a deep mutual understanding between us. We found that we could agree on many issues but also importantly that, when our views differed, we could understand each other exceptionally well. Each grasped where the other was coming from. Each understood the other’s way of doing business. We realised that we shared a language not just linguistically but metaphorically.It is therefore worrying that, in the emotional turmoil of Brexit, a large swathe of opinion in London, although of course by no means everyone, has come to misunderstand seven major aspects of Ireland: our motivation, allegiance, influence, intelligence, resolve, politics and friendship.Ireland’s allegiance to the EU likewise seems to have come as a surprise to some in London. However, it is logical and inevitable. Ireland hopes for the closest of relationships with the UK into the future but we will be part of the European Union and not part of the United Kingdom.Perhaps the misunderstanding that has proved most upsetting to the Brexiteers has been their recent discovery of Ireland’s influence. They should have understood that for the first time in history Ireland, with the inevitable strong support of our 26 EU partners, would no longer have the weaker diplomatic hand. They should have anticipated that the power relationship of the past would no longer apply.Then there is the misunderstanding of Ireland’s intelligence – not a new phenomenon of course, but one that had seemed to be a thing of the past. There have been breezy comments about simple technological solutions to the border issue, whimsical suggestions that this could all be sorted out later, and at one point a waggish suggestion that, if it’s alright with you lads, the backstop will be time-limited. To be fair, Dublin has had the advantage of being able to focus on the complex issues rather than on dealing with friendly fire.Many in London also fundamentally misread Ireland’s resolve. They believed that the Irish government was grandstanding and would eventually cave in. That particular penny has now dropped.The depth of ignorance about Irish politics, including from some Conservative MPs, has truly made us laugh rather than cry. One thinks, to cite just one example, of the suggestion that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was doing Sinn Fein’s bidding. More significantly, there has been a serious underestimation of the depth of public support in Ireland for the Irish government’s policy.Most importantly of all, many in London have significant misconceptions about Ireland’s friendship for Britain and for its people. The mutual affection and respect which characterised Queen Elizabeth’s state visit to Ireland in 2011 are now deeply rooted in Irish minds and hearts. They will not be dislodged by the aggression and condescension that has characterised some of the recent comment from London. Not even by Patel. The affection and respect between our peoples will transcend Brexit, if it happens. But equally our friendship with Britain today is one of equals and will not deflect us, as committed and confident members of the European Union, from pursuing our interests, none of which is greater than maintaining the status quo of the Good Friday agreement insofar as that is possible in the circumstances created by Brexit.In fact, Collins Dictionary’s “chosen word” for 2018, among the many new coinages, was “single-use”. It might be useful for MPs to look up that word too as they reflect on the Northern Ireland backstop. They should take some reassurance from the definition of “single-use” that is “designed to be used and then disposed of or destroyed”. But then they should also look up the words “unless” and “until”.• Bobby McDonagh was Ireland’s ambassador to the UK from 2009-13"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/752ee8ff7aa24e5e198c381c43c8247317f0030a/0_316_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd242b3d89660000aa856166a0fe383","title":"tory mp no deal theresa may brexit power eu","story":"Rebrand no deal as ‘clean global Brexit’ and let’s get behind it, before the prime minister hands even more power to the EU“It is your decision. Not politicians. Not parliament. Just you. If we vote to leave, we will leave. There’ll not be another renegotiation or another referendum.”Those were the wise words of David Cameron before the referendum. He was not the only one. MPs across the political spectrum confirmed that this would be the final decision. But what about the final decision come Tuesday’s vote in the House of Commons?I am a serial loyalist. I have never rebelled against the government. Since being elected in 2015, I have faithfully trooped through the government lobbies – and every fibre of my being instructs me, urges me along the path of loyalty. Yet my every instinct tells me that the prime minister’s deal is wrong.The prime minister is absolutely right to say that people just want us to get on with it. But this proposal does not do that. It will lead to years more wrangling, both with the EU and among ourselves. As the attorney general set out in his legal advice, there is a risk that we could be subject to protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations. Hardly the level of certainty that our businesses want.What is worse is that we can’t get out of it of our own volition. Loss of sovereignty was the main reason that I voted leave. To take back control. This proposal leads to the exact opposite: it cedes control to the EU.Don’t just take it from a committed Brexiteer like me. Listen to some of my colleagues, who voted remain, such as Jo Johnson and Sam Gyimah. Both resigned from the government. Gyimah put it starkly, saying that we will have surrendered our voice, our vote and our veto, and we will be reliant upon the EU to strike a deal that lies in our national interest. He is right.There is also the European court. It is technically right to say that we will be leaving the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). But that is little comfort when the CJEU will still retain such a significant and prominent role under the proposed treaty. When the backstop kicks in, the European court will have a say over rules such as those relating to the movement of goods, VAT and excise, and agriculture and environment law. Further, in any dispute where interpretation of EU law is in question, the agreement shall be referred to the CJEU to interpret. As we have seen in the recent case seeking to revoke article 50 and stop Brexit, the CJEU is an overtly political court. We need to be out of it. Full stop.There are other fundamental objections to the deal, such as that it risks the integrity of the United Kingdom. And yet May has said that it is this deal, no deal – or no Brexit. No Brexit would be a betrayal impossible for us to countenance. It is not an option. The trust between people and politicians rightly would be destroyed. If Brexit is stopped, we will never be forgiven. Business fears a Jeremy Corbyn government – yes, far more than Brexit. But if we stop Brexit, a Corbyn government would be inevitable.So what about no deal? The negativity and fear-mongering around this prospect knows no bounds. If we are driven down this path by an intransigent EU, let’s cut out the scare tactics and get behind what should be called a “clean global Brexit”. Let us be straightforward: if the EU doesn’t accept a sensible free trade agreement such as a Canada-style deal, there will be difficulties. But it is in our country’s national interest to look beyond the immediate short term.We were warned of this at the time of the referendum. Thanks to the Treasury’s economic forecasts, we know that people voted to leave despite being told that they would lose their jobs despite being told that they would be poorer and despite being told that there would be an immediate and profound economic shock. Since when we have seen record levels of employment with more than 600,000 new jobs created.In any case, there is an alternative to no deal and to no Brexit. A Canada-style trade deal was offered to Britain back in March 2017. We should now go back to the EU and propose “super Canada”, but for the whole of the United Kingdom. That should be our final offer – and we should be prepared to walk away and prepare for a clean global Brexit. And we must stop the doom-mongering. After all, we have been preparing for no deal for over two years and more than £4bn has been set aside for these preparations. If the EU won’t accept super Canada for the whole UK, we will be ready. And in the fullness of time, when countries like Germany and France realise that they are losing out, they will encourage the EU back to the negotiating table, and sensible discussions will follow.It will be a clean global Brexit, and one that leads to a bright future for us and a sensible trade deal with the EU. It was the people’s decision to leave. Not politicians. We will leave. And on Tuesday, it is not for parliament to block it.• Michael Tomlinson is the Conservative MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole and a former parliamentary private secretary to Dominic Raab"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2dff9a0fa3b91d88c3b7b378e3902ce6621cd50/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df483156d40f6c6324b2cf7c55584285","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of happy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘happy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘happy’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what happy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 December at 10am.

Everyone remembers the hopelessly sentimental Art Garfunkel theme song. Many will never forget the trauma of witnessing big-eyed bunny rabbits being mercilessly and bloodily slain.In an interview published in the Radio Times Christmas edition, Adams’s daughters explain how the book, first published when their father was a civil servant in his mid-50s, came into being.They also address the multiple theories about the true message of Watership Down. “Honestly, the stuff we got through the post from fans about what they think the book is about,” said Rosamond.“‘Is Woundwort an allegory of Stalin?’ ‘Is Hazel Jesus Christ?’ It shows that people really connect with the story, they really think hard about it, but it cut no ice with Dad. ‘Rubbish!’ he always said. ‘It’s just a story about rabbits.’”They recall being six and eight in the mid-60s and on a long car journey to the theatre from London to Stratford-upon-Avon. They pestered their dad for a story and then came: “Once upon a time there were two rabbits called Hazel and Fiver …”Persuaded by his daughters to put pen to paper, Adams’s book was published in 1972 and won the Carnegie medal and the  children’s book prize.The 1978 animation, featuring the voices of John Hurt and Richard Briers, was scarringly graphic.Rightly so, said the daughters. “Daddy didn’t like the way people babied, and pandered to and ‘icky-ised’ children, lying to them about death and so on,” said Juliet. “We’re destroying the environment and endangering all the animals – I think it would be strange to ignore that.”Producers have suggested the new version, a BBCNetflix co-production, will be less violent. There will also be more comedy and more prominent female characters.Nicholas Hoult, who voices Fiver, has predicted people will watch it and cry. “I remember me and (director) Noam (Murro) both crying when we were doing the last scene. We were both hugging as we were crying. I did the take probably 450 times and I cried every single time. I defy anyone not to cry.”Other voices include Gemma Arterton, Anne-Marie Duff, John Boyega, James McAvoy and Olivia Colman. Sam Smith has recorded a song called Fire On Fire with the BBC Concert Orchestra.

That perennially excellent actor Toni Collette gave us some of the best work of her career as Annie, a contemporary artist and miniaturist. She specialises in intricately wrought dioramas with scenes taken from her own life, all reduced to Lilliputian scale. Clearly, this artistic approach says something about her own control-freakery and dysfunction. Annie’s elderly mother, an unpleasant old woman with whom Annie and her husband did not particularly get on, has just died after a long history of dementia. But then she makes contact from beyond the grave, wanting somehow to take over Annie’s 13-year-old son, her grandson, and somehow claim him in the cause of evil.The atmosphere of impending horror is terrifically managed – it has something of Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby. It doesn’t rely on the tired digital sound-stabs and jump-scares of lesser scary movies, but that isn’t to say that Aster is too grand to give us one or two old-fashioned cattle-prod jabs. I lurched and convulsed a couple of times, once at something so normally innocuous as the childlike sound of someone doing the clip-clopping sound of a horse. There are other excellent contributions from Gabriel Byrne, playing the stolid, supportive but careworn husband, from Milly Shapiro as their daughter Charlie, and also from Alex Wolff – already a familiar player in teen and YA movies – who is very good in this.What the film’s satirical meanings are is an open question. The topic of dementia – how we should react to it and open up the conversation around it – has become more current. It could be that Hereditary is providing a complex, subversive slant on this issue. But I think it is more nihilist than that. It is more about the mental squeeze of middle-age, and the dark fear or even horror of older people, in the light of an increasingly undeniable truth that you are going to turn into one of them. When I first saw this, I wrote that it was like a death-metal version of Cries and Whispers, and the director has since revealed that he screened Cries and Whispers for the cast. Since then, I have found myself thinking more about Fanny and Alexander and its puppet theatre. There is something inexpressibly sinister about Annie’s miniatures, and the suspicion that these human beings are themselves just figures being moved around by the devil himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7224c165d38522e23b2304e5e5c14375eef3782f/0_243_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6bdae75cad7852f079cc238eb501d60","title":"thomasina miers alternative christmas canape indian spiced sausage rolls recipe","story":"These curry-spiced sausage rolls could grace the Christmas table instead of pigs in blankets, or as canapes for partiesOver Christmas, we usually try to throw a lunch party (isn’t seeing the people we love the stuff of life?) and we often visit the Indian sub-continent for inspiration, with my father such an avid fan of Madhur Jaffrey.

Finely slice the ginger and chop finely with the garlic. In a small pan, warm the oil over a medium heat and fry the onion for seven or eight minutes, until soft.Meanwhile, gently toast the cumin, coriander and fenugreek seeds in a small, dry frying pan over a medium heat for a minute or two, until they smell fragrant, then grind in a mortar or spice grinder. Add the garlic, ginger and all the spices to the onions, and saute for four to five minutes more to soften the garlic and ginger.Finally, stir in the tomato puree, remove from the heat, season well and turn the mixture out on to a plate to cool.

Fry a little of the mixture in a pan to check the seasoning – you may want to add a pinch more salt. Now remove the pastry from the fridge, put on a floured surface and cut in half lengthways. Divide the sausagemeat in half and roll into two long sausages. Put a sausage along the length of each pastry and brush the long edges with egg wash. Roll the pastries around the meat and press the pastry together where it meets, using a fork to crimp the edges. Brush all over with egg wash, sprinkle with fennel seeds and cut into mini rolls about the thickness of a walnut – any thinner and they will fall over in the oven. At this stage, you can freeze them, separating the layers with parchment paper.Bake for 20-25 minutes, until puffed and golden, and serve with red onion marmalade, chutney or simply by themselves.You can double the quantity of the sausage filling to make meatballs – delicious with a simple ginger- and garlic-scented tomato sauce. This is an option for coeliacs if you omit the breadcrumbs from the filling. Buy extra pastry to freeze – always handy for whipping up a quick tart or makeshift pizza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1a90f78d71a6a6efd0db842864770bea9286b3/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54efdd9589b06222117219d0d7f57d54","title":"premier league 10 talking points football","story":"Bournemouth are looking threadbare, Pep Guardiola shows the stomach for a fight and Leicester pine for Jamie VardyWith the issues piling up in terms of Arsenal’s defensive composition, it almost passed unnoticed that against Huddersfield they managed a league clean sheet – their first since September. Centre‑back concerns felt strongly under the microscope at the end of a week when Rob Holding suffered a cruciate injury, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi picked up simultaneous suspensions for their yellow card count, and the German skulked off with an injury in any case. Unai Emery has to find, to borrow an old Wengerism, internal solutions for Sunday’s game at Southampton. Stephan Lichtsteiner and Nacho Monreal, career full-backs, could be drafted in to a back three. Laurent Koscielny has not played for seven months and was not deemed fit enough to come on against Huddersfield. Emery will have to make do and mend. Amy LawrenceMohamed Salah put on a masterclass in finishing at Bournemouth but there was no denying that Eddie Howe’s players gave Liverpool a helping hand during a meek and error-strewn second-half performance that exposed weaknesses in a squad that appears to be creaking. With Lewis Cook joining Dan Gosling and Adam Smith on the sidelines, and Callum Wilson also missing with a hamstring injury, Bournemouth are looking a little thin on the ground at a time when their form has badly tailed off. The fixture list has not been kind but five defeats in six games – and given how well Huddersfield played on Tuesday they could have lost all six – has punctured some of that early season optimism. Bournemouth are still eighth, only three points behind Manchester United, but January could be a good time for Howe to freshen things up. Stuart JamesAfter two hernia operations in six months, the return of James Tarkowski to full fitness will be a great relief to Sean Dyche, who has witnessed Burnley suffer a poor start to the season, not aided by the fact his natural replacement, Ben Gibson, is yet to make a league appearance because of a similar problem. Although Tarkowski has made 13 league appearances the hernia has continued to trouble him. He first underwent surgery in the summer but a second operation recently seems to have helped him overcome his pains, crucially allowing him to take his place alongside Ben Mee. Tarkowski’s third Premier League goal of the season was decisive but a clean sheet for a team who had conceded 32 times in 15 previous league matches will be a further boost that can be built on heading into two tough games, against Tottenham and Arsenal. Will UnwinIt may seem unfair to argue Callum Paterson should not be leading the line just after he has scored a winner, but imagine what Cardiff might be capable of with a proven Premier League goalscorer in their ranks. It must be especially galling for Bobby Reid and Gary Madine, forwards with a single goal between them this season. Neil Warnock travelled to France on a scouting trip this month and the Nantes striker Emiliano Sala is among those on his January wish list. The Cardiff manager has built a unique side, one dripping in team spirit, but after passing up several chances before eventually finding the breakthrough, it is no secret they are short of quality in the final third. “We all know what we need,” Warnock said. “It’s no good looking for a certain type of player because they’ve got to be able to work hard as well as put the ball in the net.” Ben FisherPep Guardiola was sanguine while dissecting a first Premier League loss, expressing joy and satisfaction at his players’ performance even in defeat, until the relentlessness of the ision cropped up. “You don’t have to tell me how competitive this league is,” he snapped back. “It’s you and your analysts that keep saying we are invincible, that we are perfect and that, in February, we are going to win the league. You said that. All of you. Not the manager, not any player, not the club.” He had a point. It was refreshing to see a team resist City so effectively, to leave Liverpool alone as unbeaten – already a fine achievement – but the champions’ focus remains. Maybe the title race will be tighter this time round, extending further into the spring, but Guardiola already seemed to be thrilling to the challenge. His belief in his players will not be dented by a solitary defeat. Dominic FifieldChelsea’s form had been sketchy before Saturday, and Maurizio Sarri’s tactics were partially responsible. So wedded is he to his philosophy that for him, change constitutes bringing off a player in order to replace him with whoever on the bench is most similar. This was evident in the goalless home draw with Everton and the defeats by Spurs and Wolves, suggesting a belief that his system is infallible and when it doesn’t work, the problem is necessarily one of personnel. But against Manchester City we saw the first modifications to it: N’Golo Kanté took on a slightly deeper role, starting closer to Jorginho, while Eden Hazard, nominally Chelsea’s centre-forward, roved about the pitch as he pleased. Both moves were crucial in securing a landmark victory – what may, in later years, be identified as the point at which the Sarri era truly began. Daniel HarrisA first defeat in seven gives little cause for Leicester to panic but the manner of their reverse against Spurs did lay bare an elephant in the room. They missed the injured Jamie Vardy for a second consecutive week and it showed, with Kelechi Iheanacho putting in a skittish performance in his stead and hearing some of the crowd cheer when he was taken off. Vardy turns 32 next month and, while he is a remarkable specimen, the time will soon come when the zip and incisiveness that have been so fundamental to Leicester’s success begin to tail off. Claude Puel was noncommittal when asked whether he would supplement his attack in January but it is probably time for a little succession planning. Leicester remain a far less potent proposition without their attacking talisman and that, sooner rather than later, will have to change. Nick AmesThe sign of how far Manchester United have fallen is that there was genuine surprise in Fulham suffering a 4-1 trouncing at the hands of José Mourinho’s team. The corollary of this is particularly concerning for Claudio Ranieri’s new team: it shows just how poor they are and how much of an achievement it would be for him to save the bottom side from the drop. Fulham have nine points, the same as Southampton, yet United could only draw at St Mary’s the previous Saturday. Ranieri’s men carried minimal menace and were seriously off the pace with and without the ball. As the Italian put it: “I said to my players: ‘If you play like in the first half it is the way to relegation. But if we play like in the second half we can survive.’” Next up are West Ham, Newcastle, Wolves and Huddersfield Fulham have to start collecting points soon. Jamie JacksonAfter a run of one point from six games that suggested Wolves were perhaps not the greatest team to ever win promotion to the Premier League, two victories have set them back on track. But maybe most encouraging for Nuno Espírito Santo’s side in those two games is the attacking dynamism and threat that has often been absent, specifically from Diogo Jota. The forward scored 18 goals last season but had not managed any this term before the win over Chelsea: now he has two in two, and he added to his strike against Newcastle by providing the driving run from which Matt Doherty eventually got their winner. They still have only 17 goals from 16 games, fewer than every other team above 13th and only one more than bottom-placed Fulham, but if Jota can keep up this form then they will look in much better shape. Nick MillerRobert Snodgrass’s resurgence at West Ham is proof that hard work pays off. A £10m signing from Hull in January 2017, the winger was a figure of scorn at the London Stadium until Manuel Pellegrini’s arrival in the summer and it seemed his future lay elsewhere when David Sullivan, the club’s co-owner, said that it was a mistake to buy him last year. But while Slaven Bilic was happy to loan Snodgrass to Aston Villa at the start of last season, Pellegrini told the Scotland international that he would give him a chance if he shed some pounds. Leaner and meaner now, the 31‑year‑old’s influence has grown since Andriy Yarmolenko ruptured an achilles in October and he chose a fine way to score his first Premier League goal for West Ham in their win over Crystal Palace, sparking a thrilling comeback with a curling strike from 20 yards.

After showing that Arsenal can be beaten last week, they backed it up by grabbing a tight win over a stingy Birmingham side. Arsenal have company at the top of the table, although they do have a game in hand. Still, this was an important victory for City, who had to work hard against Marc Skinner’s side. Birmingham are an efficient outfit and are always difficult to break down. But they like to play out from the back and City targeted that, with Nikita Parris leading their high press. It brought a reward when Birmingham’s young goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, made the error that led to Georgia Stanway scoring the game’s only goal. City closed it out from there, making themselves solid in midfield, guarding the ball well and showing that their game management skills are maturing. They will have to keep doing that in order to keep up with Arsenal.• As it happened: Manchester City 1-0 Birmingham CityChelsea have gathered momentum. They waited late for goals against Brighton, whose habit of conceding after the hour mark is a concern from a fitness perspective. Hope Powell, the Brighton manager, has to look at why her team are fading as games wear on. Her side held Chelsea for a while, but losing 4-0 at home shows they cannot be certain of staying in the WSL. As for Chelsea, they are putting their foot down after a slow start and have risen five points off first place. Their flowing football is returning. Beth England’s double ensured that Fran Kirby was not missed and there was also some great skill from Erin Cuthbert, who showed that Scotland will be a threat at next summer’s World Cup. Chelsea, who still have to go to Arsenal and City, mean business.Down in the Championship, there was a first defeat of the season for the Manchester United start-up. United have done very well so far – while they are level on points with Charlton Athletic, they remain top with a goal difference of +39 – and I still fancy them to win promotion. However Durham are an experienced side and they knew what to do against United this time. They were tight at the back and counterattacked well. United will back themselves to respond well, though, and they would be a welcome addition to the WSL given that they have had some record-breaking attendances this season. There was a crowd of 5,500 for one of their games.The honeymoon period is over for Willie Kirk, Everton’s new manager. They fell short against Bristol City, Kirk’s old side, and continue to pay for their wastefulness in front of goal. Judged on statistics alone, you would expect Everton to win more games. They create a lot of chances. But they lack ruthlessness and Kirk will need to bring in a No 9 in January. They lost Courtney Sweetman-Kirk to Liverpool last summer and Chloe Kelly, who has been asked to play up front, is more of an attacking midfielder. Everton are two points above the foot of the table and they will be in trouble without more firepower, especially as they remain too open at the back. Ella Rutherford scored a great goal for City, but she was given too much time to smash home her volley.I’m not surprised that West Ham are doing well under Matt Beard. West Ham’s manager has earned respect at all his clubs and players love his coaching style. He knows the league, has gained experience in America and is the perfect person to build a new side. He has taken no time to unite a new group of players and has benefited from some good summer signings. West Ham brought in some hardy England internationals and they also recruited well from abroad. Alisha Lehmann, the Austrian forward, and the German midfielder Julia Simic each scored twice in the 5-0 away win over Yeovil Town.

Racism in football, racism in the media, racism in society as a whole and from certain high-up quarters the response has been to show sympathy and support for Sterling and call for change. But here’s the thing: nothing will change. It never does when it comes to racism in this country.That is what Sterling picked up on in his post. Two footballers, his Manchester City teammates Tosin Adarabioyo and Phil Foden, have bought expensive properties at a relatively young age but, while one is portrayed as the nice kid next door doing something for his mum, the other is made out to be greedy and thick. You don’t have to be a genius, or indeed have seen Sterling’s post, to figure out which is which.Sterling has, of course, experienced this first-hand – the stories about his expensive sink and his easyJet flight, lazy tabloid tales told by lazy tabloid journalists, painting him out to be a villain, the black kid riding around in a hoodie ready to knife you and your family at any given moment – and he’s finally had enough. What is alleged to have happened to him during City’s 2-0 defeat by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday has tipped this usually quiet, shy young man over the edge, which in itself speaks volumes.So yes, we have a race problem in this country and it’s nice to see so many people acknowledge that. Especially all the white middle‑class men who work in the national, mainstream media who simply couldn’t wait to get on Twitter on Sunday and tell the world how they feel Sterling’s pain and how it’s time to ease not only that pain but the pain of all young black people in this country. Yet how much do you want to bet that, come Monday morning, this will all be forgotten by those same people? They’ll move on to the next story, feeling they’ve done their bit, while in truth they have done nothing at all.Because that’s what race is to the national, mainstream media in this country – a story for today. It’s not something they actually want to tackle or rectify. And why would they when practically all the people in power – the CEOs, the editors, the main broadcasters and main writers – are all white? They make the decisions and, ultimately, they look after themselves.Black people are allowed in but only if they play certain roles. Hence why you see jovial types such as Ian Wright and Chris Kamara go far, or safe, nice types like Jermaine Jenas and Alex Scott do the same. They are the acceptable faces of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) representation in this country’s media, a minority within a minority, so is it any wonder that the coverage of BAME sportspeople, and young black footballers especially, is so skewed and harmful?As far as the British media are concerned, someone who looks like me is not allowed to talk like me. I’m dangerous, not to be trusted and tolerated. Of course it’s OK for Roy Keane to be outspoken and controversial. If anything, he’s not controversial enough. But me – no, it’s not accepted. Hence me finding myself off screens and radios in my own country and having to work instead in Russia.Some people will call me paranoid or outright wrong but I’m not and I have recent proof of this. In June I did an interview with the  in which I made similar points to those I’m making here – calling out racist attitudes in the media. Did anyone in the media pay attention, show sympathy or an appetite to change things? Of course they didn’t. Instead the whole thing was reduced to a “war of words” between Stan Collymore and Ian Wright, and of course “Wrighty” won because everyone loves “Wrighty”. He’s the guy with the cheeky grin and infectious laugh, while I’m the big, bad black man that’s not to be trusted. All of which ignores the fact Ian works for the Sun, a newspaper which has done as much as any other to vilify Sterling.But that’s what always happens – the double standards and hypocrisy get swept under the carpet because nobody in this country, and in the media especially, actually wants to tackle race in this country. Everyone’s speaking about it now because one of our most famous, and brilliant, footballers has raised the issue, but it will soon be forgotten. If not tomorrow then certainly in the days and weeks that follow.So thank you to all the white, middle-class media personalities in this country for showing you care. But until you actually turn your words into actions and get more BAME people into your organisations to make sure BAME coverage is fairer, kinder and more balanced, I don’t want to know. And, judging by his Instagram post, I’m pretty sure Raheem Sterling feels the same way.Stan Collymore is a former Liverpool, Aston Villa and England forward who currently works as a broadcaster for Russian state television channel RT"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d77cf0f3cbd5ee968564cc1f836ae63d994bba6/129_305_3371_2022/master/3371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325d2714ce888c1d81a41463582218be","title":"his magnum opus even for lionel messi this was special","story":"This weekend Messi did something unusual: he did something he hasn’t done before, exceeding his own expectationsSunday morning and military machines rolled down the Castellana, armoured vehicles on the move. Snipers stood on roofs and helicopters circled. Something big was happening. “We’ll know how it feels,” Marca said, which they wouldn’t of course, but like everyone else they hoped to find out. And, like everyone else, they were trying. Politicians packed the place, more even than usual, and people arrived from everywhere, papers dedicating dozens of pages. Florentino Pérez left Real Madrid’s match at Huesca early to be there and the best player in the world was due as soon as he’d finished, his club mates too. The third best was there. And so was the fifth.Leo Messi boarded a plane bound for the Bernabéu, where he’s scored more than any visitor, but he wasn’t playing this time. This was the weekend when Javi Calleja was sacked as Villarreal manager and a last-minute equaliser for Valencia couldn’t stop that classic Spanish protest, Mestalla whipping out white hankies when Betis defender Sidnei went all Maradona, or so they said, and Eibar and Levante went wild when Cornellá hosted the Catalan derby and Butarque the “southern derby”, Leganés’s mascot presiding over an on-pitch proposal at half time against Getafe because nothing says romance like a six-foot cucumber. Yet much of that didn’t warrant a word because this was also the weekend when Madrid hosted the derby one they tried to make their own, although it’s not.The Copa Libertadores came to Spain: River-Boca at the Santiago Bernabéu, never quite the same but still quite something. And Messi, like almost everyone else, didn’t want to miss it. Yet if there was anything that shouldn’t be missed – this weekend and pretty much every other weekend too – it is Messi. One day, not so far away now, it won’t be a choice to make, and then it will be too late, Saturday underlining just how much of a void he may leave. The Catalan derby had been billed as the most even in memory, Eyol chasing a Champions League place, but in front of 24,037 at Cornellá-Prat, the stadium half-empty, Barcelona defeated Eyol 4-0, Messi making a myth of equality.Ousmane Dembélé scored a lovely goal, Luis Suárez too, but this was about him – and this weekend of all weekends, as if any excuse was needed, which perhaps it is and perhaps that’s the problem. This weekend Messi did something unusual: he did something he hasn’t done before, exceeding his own expectations.On 15 minutes, he ran through, got fouled, got up and began his ritual. He put the ball on the floor, twisting it, almost screwing it into the turf, and stepped back. On the touchline, Barcelona’s manager watched. “I was thinking: Diego López es well he’s going to have to hit it perfectly,” Ernesto Valverde said, and that’s what he did, bending it high and hard, from left to right, always just beyond López’s reach, almost taunting him as it went, and into the top corner. Then, an hour in, he did it again, only into the other corner this time. “Sometimes you take a load of free-kicks and you don’t score,” Messi said after. Yeah, and sometimes you do.This was the first time he’d scored two free-kicks in a game by the end, there was almost a hint of disappointment he didn’t score a hat-trick of them. “There’s not much I can say, not much I can add to what everyone has seen. Against a free-kick taker like him, there’s not much you can do, although you have to try something: sneak forward, stand on your toes, take the wall away maybe,” Rubí said. Messi has scored 10 free-kicks in 2018, while over the last four years, he’s scored more than any team in Europe’s five biggest leagues, ahead of Juventus, Bayern, Madrid and PSG.Like that’s everything anyway, even if some players have made a career of that. “If you don’t foul him, he gets through to the ‘kitchen’,” Rubí admitted. The kitchen, you see, is right at the back at the house, or at least it’s supposed to be. “We tried to cut off his path and if we fouled him it’s because we had to,” Rubí added. On Saturday Messi scored two, sure, but he also created five chances. You could take his first half alone, take each of the things he did, spread them out, one per game, and distribute them to just about any other footballer and you’ve got a candidacy for player of the month, two months running. It is not just what he does, it’s how much he does: the relentlessness, the repetitiveness, how routine it becomes.Even for Messi, this was superb. “His Magnum opus,” El Mundo called it. He was hyperactive – if there is a moment that stands out, beyond the dribbles or the passes, it might even be when he chased back to win the ball, which is kind of daft really, but makes sense in a man-bites-dog sort of way. Perhaps there was some extra motivation in the week in which he finished fifth in the Ballon d’Or and Pelé bizarrely insisted he is one-footed, bad in the air, and only has one skill. Or perhaps it is everything that goes around him that makes it feel that way, everything that is said. Not so much what Pelé said as the very fact that he said it. Perhaps it is the game – a derby – and the timing, the context, as much as the performance. And, yes, that makes these pages guilty too. It would be a nonsense to claim that he gets ignored but sometimes, maybe an excuse is needed for Messi to be the story.This week, there was one, that’s for sure. It’s just a pity that the excuse is often translated as indignation, some slightly strange, occasionally tiresome rage, an often-unnecessary, sometimes unpleasant anger. As if Luka Modric, or Cristiano Ronaldo or Antoine Griezmann or Kylian Mbappé are rubbish, unworthy of respect or celebration as if three European Cups or a World Cup mean nothing. As if awards actually matter that much, anyway. As if they matter this much: if there was a recurring theme on Saturday, it was Messi’s place in the Ballon d’Or. Everywhere it seemed people recalled that he’d finished fifth – a single word that seemed to come in italics and with its own built-in ?!.Democracy was derided and France Football stood accused. A grand conspiracy at worst at best, journalists who know nothing. Even though players and managers retuned the same verdict. If there is something in the surprise – on ESPN, presenter Dan Thomas asked a simple, incisive question: “If this had been Messi’s first season …?” – if Messi pays for having normalised the abnormal, held to different standards if there is some underlying if not entirely justified desire for something new among voters, there is also a difference between player of the year award and best player. And the stage on which awards are decided are often different ones.Cornellá may not condition the Ballon d’Or, but the Ballon d’Or did appear to condition Cornellá it provided the context, at least. The response, too. “O Rei Messi,” cheered the cover of El Mundo Deportivo, its headline pointing Pelé’s way “the Ballon d’Or blushes”, claimed the front of Sport: it, like Barcelona’s kit, had gone pink with embarrassment. “The Ballon d’Or is very strange, but for us he’s the number one,” Gerard Piqué said. “The Ballon d’Or is a lie,” Jordi Alba added. But on the weekend when Argentina’s best game eclipsed all else and so did Argentina’s best player, Valverde put it best: “It’s bloody brilliant that Messi’s here with us.”• “We didn’t just park our arses in our own area, and the players did everything I asked of them. Sometimes I tell them that we have to be calmer when we’re in the lead, but that’s not the way I am and they tend to follow the way their manager is.” That’s what José Luis Mendilibar said and that’s the way we like him. This week above all, when Eibar and Levante went from 1-0 to 1-2 and from 4-2 to 4-4, a 92nd-minute goal providing the finish to a morning of madness.• “We did almost nothing in the second half,” Thibaut Courtois said and he wasn’t wrong. Apart from about himself. Gareth Bale’s first league goal for 99 days was just about all Madrid did as they somehow managed a victory at bottom-of-the-table Huesca. “Vulgar,” AS called them.• Two late goals from Carlos Bacca could not salvage anything for Villarreal against Celta and could not save their manager either. Javi Calleja has been sacked – and not, in truth, before time. Iago Aspas is very, very good, by the way – but then you knew that already.• Athletic Bilbao have changed their manager mid-season for the first time in a decade, but they won’t be changing their philosophy. Gaizka Garitano takes charge for the first time in the league on Monday. They haven’t won since the opening day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b40b0a54500f2e9922922acb38bafda5c93811/0_23_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41577d6960e6508c0c30be90bb3af7be","title":"jadon sanchos stock rises higher and higher after a derby to remember","story":"After a difficult week, the English teenager scored the winner against Schalke as Borussia Dortmund continue their chargeIt was dark when Borussia Dortmund’s bus arrived back at the club’s training ground in Brackel but it couldn’t get in. It was blocked by several hundred supporters, chanting and lighting the winter night with pyro. A couple of the players, Axel Witsel and Achraf Hakimi, got off the coach and joined them.This may already be shaping up to be a special season for Dortmund but if you wondered what this dream start – unbeaten in the Bundesliga, soaring above champions Bayern Munich having beaten them in Der Klassiker last month, through to the Champions League last 16 – was missing, then here was the answer. They had entered Saturday afternoon’s match already 19 points clear of rivals Schalke but winning the Revierderby, whenever, however, always means so much.Dortmund had been winless in their last five meetings against the old enemy – their last derby victory came in November 2015 – and it was an itch that badly needed scratching, as Mario Götze admitted in the week leading up to the game. Götze’s only goal in the fixture, in November last year, had been blemished by the small matter of his team frittering away a 4-0 half-time lead to draw. So even in these circumstances, no chickens were being counted at Westfalen.Eventually, it fell to a player in his first Revierderby to decide it – and in trying circumstances. Jadon Sancho missed training sessions last week to fly to London after his grandmother’s death – and missing training at Dortmund almost always means being left out of the XI. He was offered the option of sitting out after his return on Friday night, “but he really wanted to play,” said coach Lucien Favre. He rose to the occasion and then some, responding after Daniel Caligiuri’s unexpected second-half equaliser by picking the ball up on the left, playing a one-two with substitute Raphaël Guerreiro and taking his time before expertly tucking the winner past Ralf Fährmann into the far corner.In the words of sporting director Michael Zorc, it was part of “an exceptional performance” by the English teenager, especially when set against the background of a tough few days. After the ball hit the net, Sancho raised his arms to the sky, index fingers pointed, before being comforted by his waiting teammates. Their estimation of him is clear. “I’ve got great respect for his strong mentality,” said skipper Marco Reus. “It’s a big compliment to him that he continued to train, to be focused – and that he managed to smile.”Throughout Sancho was willing and available, happy to take on possession in the sort of closed, tight situations that characterise a derby. The only irony after he tormented left-back Bastian Oczipka – who looked all at sea and spent much of the game treading on eggshells after a yellow card for fouling the England winger – was that Sancho should pop up on the opposite side for his goal.He also exhibited the imagination that Schalke lacked, despite considerable investment in their midfield with Sebastian Rudy, Suat Serdar and Omar Mascarell all joining. As Kicker’s Toni Lieto put it: “The Revierderby has made it clear to everyone in the league, Schalke are only partially competitive.” After 14 games they’re going along at a point per game and their 15 goals include four penalties after Caligiuri’s successful spot kick.For a single-goal win, this felt emphatic, and was celebrated as such by the 6,000 travelling Dortmund fans. While it means a great deal in isolation, this victory couldn’t have been better timed with three fixtures to go in the calendar year in terms of impetus. To say Dortmund are begging for the winter break would be overstating it but they will welcome it. “Of course,” said Reus, “you slowly notice that the power isn’t there like it was at the start of the season. That’s why it’s important that we have a lot of players in our squad of sufficient quality to step in.”Some will get a chance at Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, with Reus, Delaney, Sancho (who will be going home to spend time with his family), Witsel, Lukasz Piszczek and Jacob Bruun Larsen all rested. If they are feeling the strain of their efforts, then they are reaping the rewards of them too.Time will tell if the spring will be worthy of unpacking more pyro for the BVB faithful. For now, they are meeting every possible challenge – which is giving their local rivals plenty to ponder before the winter break and its transfer window.• It never rains but it pours for Stuttgart at the moment. The strugglers put in a strong display at Borussia Mönchengladbach to hold the second-placed team for 69 minutes, before Gladbach subs Raffael and Florian Neuhaus scored and then, in the space of a minute, Stuttgart’s own substitute Erik Thommy received a second yellow and Benjamin Pavard pulled a hamstring while scoring an own goal. The visitors finished with nine men and will be without Pavard until 2019. “I’ve rarely experienced anything like it,” said a glum Markus Weinzierl.• Bayern kept the gap to nine points with a 3-0 win over a Nüremburg side who are next to useless on the road. That might be unremarkable, but perhaps more significant is Niko Kovac’s choice of pairing Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka together in a midfield double pivot, with his team gradually finding some shape. It will be interesting to see if that’s the case again at Ajax in the Champions League.• Leipzig slipped to fourth after losing 3-0 at an excellent Freiburg, and for the umpteenth time had difficulty against opponents who handed them possession. “Possession’s only useful if you play vertically and get into the dangerous areas,” complained midfielder Diego Demme, a pertinent point before the must-win Europa League game against Rosenborg – though Die Roten Bullen would still need Celtic to slip up against Salzburg if they’re to qualify.• Meanwhile in Mainz …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58665766ba040df625da42d4780678f16b0eee47/0_37_1917_1150/master/1917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ed9d706fcd49e224c2a5a226e217c9","title":"napoli gear up for anfield in style amid flurry of serie a late shows","story":"Truth be told, this was a weekend of high drama but only modest consequence for most of Serie AThis was not a good weekend for those Serie A fans who prefer to leave a game early and beat the traffic. Cagliari salvaged a point at home to Roma with a goal in the 95th minute. Fiorentina left it even later away to Sassuolo, Kevin Mirallas dragging them level in the 96th. That was the same minute in which Lazio took a 2-1 lead at home to Sampdoria. Somehow, they finished all square as well.The timing of those goals offers only a glimpse of the drama. Cagliari had trailed 2-0 to Roma as late as the 84th minute. Even after Artur Ionita halved the deficit, the Sardinians quickly found themselves reduced to nine men – Luca Ceppitelli and Darijo Srna sent off for protesting a free-kick decision too vehemently. Still, Marco Sau was able to punish a moment of inattentiveness from Roma’s defence at the end.Over at the Mapei Stadium, Sassuolo celebrated to the tune of Tubthumping by Chumbawamba after establishing a 2-0 second-half lead. But it was Fiorentina, knocked down, who got up again. In fact, they did it twice.Giovanni Simeone pulled the first goal back, only for Stefano Sensi to restore the hosts’ cushion in the 80th minute. Sassuolo’s Filip Djuricic was then sent off for a second booking, and Marco Benassi reduced the arrears soon afterwards. But there was still time for Fiorentina to have Nikola Milenkovic dismissed before Mirallas, on loan from Everton, dragged them level.Wilder still were the scenes at the Stadio Olimpico. Lazio have spent the past week in a training retreat, working to find a cure for a bad recent case of ‘pareggite’ (draw-itis). They thought they had caught the break they needed when referee Davide Massa pointed to the spot following a VAR review of a free-kick that struck Joachim Andersen’s elbow in injury time.Ciro Immobile buried his penalty, but Lazio’s celebrations were short-lived, Riccardo Saponara equalising in the 99th minute with a volleyed chip over Thomas Strakosha. Sampdoria were yet another team playing a man short by this stage, too, after Bartosz Bereszynski received his marching orders late in the second half.Truth be told, this was a weekend of high drama but only modest consequence for most of Serie A. Six out of 10 games finished in draws, leaving scope for only a couple of teams – Atalanta and Empoli – to actually move up in the standings. The most significant result only reaffirmed the status quo: Juventus beating Inter 1-0 on Friday night to extend their advantage to 14 points over the third-placed Nerazzurri.This was not the champions’ most compelling performance. Inter might even draw some modest encouragement from having stood toe to toe with these opponents: creating a handful of chances and largely neutralising Cristiano Ronaldo.If Roberto Gagliardini’s shot had crept inside the right-hand upright, instead of rebounding back off the post, after he ran on to a lay-off from Mauro Icardi just after the half-hour mark, then perhaps the whole match might have played out differently. Not that Luciano Spalletti was inclined to hide behind such a notion. “We played good football,” he reflected wistfully. “But we never manage to maintain our level through a whole match.”The most convincing win of the weekend belonged to Napoli, who geared up for their Champions League Group C decider away to Liverpool by matching the Reds’ four-goal margin of victory on Saturday. Frosinone are no Bournemouth, sitting 19th in the Serie A table before kick-off, but there was still plenty here to encourage Carlo Ancelotti’s side.Most obvious were the 90 minutes played by Faouzi Ghoulam. The Algerian was on his way to establishing himself as one of the best left-backs in circulation before rupturing a cruciate ligament during a Champions League defeat to Manchester City last November. His path to recovery has been complicated by further misfortunes: most notably a fractured kneecap at the start of this year.This was his first competitive appearance in 13 months, yet Ghoulam was instantly transformative. He set up both of Arkadiusz Milik’s second-half goals: the first with a corner that swung in to the perfect spot for the striker to nod home at the near post. This was Napoli’s 31st goal of the Serie A season, but remarkably the first header: a statistic that highlights what a difference such high-quality deliveries can make.More surprising were Ghoulam’s fitness levels, flying up and down the left flank for the full 90 minutes. The expectation is that he will not start against Liverpool, though after such an eye-catching performance it certainly seems plausible that he could yet feature off the bench. In either case, his appearance here at the very least allowed Ancelotti to rest Mário Rui.The manager has tended to pick a less mobile, more defensively resilient XI in Europe this season, with Nikola Maksimovic notionally the right-back but often sliding when Napoli lose possession as the back four becomes a back five. Rui is a far less talented alternative to Ghoulam on the left but also a less adventurous one.A cautious team selection is not the same thing as a cautious attitude. Napoli have scored in every Champions League game since their frustrating stalemate away to Red Star at the start of the group stage. If the Partenopei can find the net even once at Anfield, and assuming Paris Saint-Germain beat the Serbian side, then a one-goal defeat would suffice to go through.They will take encouragement from the form of Milik, who has scored four times in his last four games for club and country. He averages one strike for every 104 minutes played in Serie A – the best ratio of any player in the ision: ahead of Krzysztof Piątek and Cristiano Ronaldo.Ancelotti stated at full-time that Napoli would go to Anfield with the intention to dictate the tempo and play their own game, not to park the bus. Such remarks are consistent with the message he has preached throughout this Champions League run: that his team is talented enough to at least have a go in every competition, that they should approach every game with the belief they can play on equal terms.So far, they have lived up to that mantra.

He also faces criminal charges of “inciting hate”, while drones have filmed his house and armed men on motorbikes track his movements.Such intimidation is part of an escalating assault on press freedoms in Nicaragua, unleashed in the wake of the civil revolt that paralysed the country earlier in the year.“This government has banned protest, captured opposition leaders, and now the only thing preventing a totalitarian dictatorship is the independent media,” says Mora. “This is the stage where they try to silence us.”Anti-government protests broke out in April, sparked by the mismanagement of fires in a protected reserve and fuelled by fiscal reforms that slashed social security. They spread after police used live ammunition on demonstrators, killing dozens.From the start of the unrest, the government tried to control coverage, pressuring media bosses to self-censor. Journalists at Channel 10 – owned by Mexican tycoon Remigio Ángel González – were initially barred from reporting on demonstrations.“It was absurd: historic events were unfolding and we were ignoring them,” says Mauricio Madrigal, the station’s news editor. He and others threatened to resign, and the prohibition was dropped.After that approach failed, officials turned to more direct tactics. Twelve members of Madrigal’s team have since quit, fearing for their family’s safety.“Every independent journalist has received death threats,” says Gerall Chávez, a reporter with VosTV, whose house was vandalised in August. One journalist has been killed during the violence in total, more than 490 violations of press freedom have been documented in the course of the crisis.Now, having regained control of the streets, the government is determined to impose control over the narrative. In doing so, it aims to ensure impunity for the state forces that slaughtered hundreds of protesters.“It’s an Orwellian strategy, to falsify the reality of the repression,” says Sofia Montenegro, a journalist and former Sandinista guerrilla who fought alongside President Daniel Ortega in the 1970s.The official version of events is disseminated through a media empire built by Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua’s first lady and, since 2017, vice-president.In 2007, shortly after her husband returned to power, Murillo published an ominous communication strategy, outlining plans to prevent critical media “contaminating” public perception of his administration.Through the next decade, Murillo spent millions of dollars of Venezuelan cooperation funds – ostensibly destined for poverty reduction – on buying up Nicaragua’s media.TV channels 4, 8, 9 and 13 are now owned by her children also under the family’s control are Radio Ya, Radio Nicaragua and Radio Sandino, state broadcaster Channel 6, and the online news service El 19 Digital.From April, this media apparatus worked to whitewash the government’s deadly response to the protests.“We presented an alternative reality, where protesters were rightwing extremists killing Sandinistas,” says Carlos Mikel Espinoza, who was editor of El 19 Digital when protests broke out. “It was fascistic, an attempt to infuse hatred into government supporters and police.” Espinoza quit and fled to Costa Rica in June, after police and militants burned alive a family of six in their own home.Murillo’s strategy has failed. Polls show that just one in five Nicaraguans believe the official line that “those who participated in roadblocks and marches are terrorists”. But this hasn’t stopped the Ortega-controlled courts prosecuting protesters as if they were the violent extremists government propaganda claims.“We challenge this fantasy reality every day,” Miguel Mora concludes. “The logical next step – which I fully expect them to take – is to send their paramilitaries to close us down altogether.“That would leave only their version of events: a pure, uncontaminated discourse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/747655215464a8e28aab1cd96bb5e01de2660c4f/2_0_3791_2276/master/3791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=713086eab7accae91a9513f0c889c74b","title":"steve mcqueen tarana burke in conversation metoo misogyny movies","story":"The director and the MeToo founder tackle misogyny and moviesBefore they sit down in a conference room in a New York hotel, Tarana Burke and Steve McQueen have never met, but they share an interest in social justice, sexual violence – in particular, how the trauma of assault plays down the generations – and questions of how victim representation is policed in pop culture. Burke, 45, is the Bronx-born senior director of Girls for Gender Equality, a lifelong educator and activist and, most recognisably, the founder of the MeToo movement which, 12 years before the alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein came forward, was set up to work with survivors of sexual trauma.McQueen is the English director of 12 Years A Slave, which won best picture at the 2014 Oscars, and most recently directed Widows, starring Viola Davis. The heist movie was in production in Chicago when the MeToo story broke and, says McQueen, cast and crew “talked and talked and talked. And listened and listened, more importantly for me. Stupid to say, but I was shocked.”Together, they discuss the astonishing testimonies unleashed by MeToo, as well as the backlash, and how Burke and McQueen would like to see the movement better served by the media, particularly the racial and class implications of who gets to be a “good” victim. They talk about their families’ roots in the West Indies and disagree, very mildly, on the place held by women within Black Lives Matter. Burke is passionate, ferocious, often very humorous about the contradictions and frailties of the MeToo movement, and the vision – developed over decades of unglamorous and largely unrecognised work – underpinning it. McQueen, meanwhile, is curious, soft-spoken and deferential to the expertise of the woman before him. It is a fascinating conversation.Steve McQueen Let’s just start! I think that what you’ve done has been extraordinarily influential. You’ve shifted everything, and people are thinking about things that happened to them in the past, and unearthing things that have been suppressed. It’s incredible.Tarana Burke Yes, and on both sides: I think survivors have suppressed things, and so have perpetrators, who now have a different understanding of consent.As a black person, I can’t be anything other than who I am, or be looked upon in other people’s gaze as who they think I am. But white women who come into this conversation, there’s an easy way out –TB OK, and you’re saying that versus –SM – I don’t want to mansplain, but as far as I see things with my mother and my sister, or my siblings, there’s a double –TB Oh, absolutely. I was talking the other day about a book called All The Women Are White, All The Blacks Are Men, But Some Of Us Are Brave.TB Right? And one of the things it deals with is the erasure, not just from the movement but in general, of black women, for whom there’s a choice: do I choose to be black first, or do I choose to be a woman? SM Wait, do you have to make a choice? Is there a choice?SM Do you think that? I don’t know if I agree.SM So, to go back to my convoluted question about white women coming into the debate?SM The irony is that the thing that made MeToo visible throughout the world was white women.TB And I have said publicly that I don’t have an issue with that.TB Right. I’ve been at this work, along with so many other women of colour, for years, and nothing that we could’ve done would’ve elevated this issue into the international spotlight.I’m a 45-year-old black woman from the Bronx who the media tries to ignore in some ways – who will acknowledge me as the person who “coined the phrase” MeToo, or as “the founder but not the leader”. They are constantly looking for other leadership.SM Yes, I’ve heard journalists say that, in MeToo and Time’s Up, there are no black leaders, and I’ve thought, what? Why is that?TB But regardless, they still will erase me. Due diligence in the media is to say “Alyssa Milano, the leader of the MeToo movement” and then in parentheses “original phrase coined by Tarana Burke in 2006”. And I don’t know how to say this without it sounding like “I should be the king” – I’m not saying that. I’m saying that, because of the investment in the work, there should at least be a conversation that says there’s a bigger vision.SM That’s why racism is so huge. It’s ginormous. That’s the thing that’s deafening.TB It’s the thread that runs through. Your narrative is being erased by these public perceptions set up by the media. There’s this real conundrum, of people who celebrate me as an inidual, but still won’t buy into what I’m saying because they’re inundated with headlines about who the MeToo movement’s going to take down next.SM When MeToo hit, we were in the middle of making Widows in Chicago and we just sat down and talked. I was shocked about certain things. I was like, really? Oh, wow.TB What’s interesting is that if we woke up tomorrow and 13 million people had a disease – because that’s what these people said, “Me too! I’ve got it, too!” – the whole world would stop. There would be three questions: how did we get here how do we stop it and how do we make sure it never happens again? Those three questions haven’t been answered in a year. It’s so commonplace that most of us don’t even think about it.SM That’s what shocked me, the normalisation of someone touching you inappropriately. It freaked me out a bit.SM Yes – well, I’ve had a partner for 23 years and we have two children.TB Did you talk to your wife about it?SM Yes I did, and she said some things I don’t want to talk about, that were very –SM Yes. Again, it’s heavy. I wish I could articulate it better, but I was also ashamed of myself, in a way – that I wasn’t sensitive enough to know about this. And maybe I’d normalised a certain behaviour. Not that I’d participated, but I never thought of it. I think what you did is wake a lot of people up to a certain pain that they had.TB In Widows, which I watched last night, there’s a scene where one of the women is regularly abused by her husband. And you see her with a black eye, and they’re sitting at breakfast, and he kind of plays around with her face and says, “Put some makeup on, that makes me uncomfortable.” And you’d think, when he died, she’d be like, “Yay!” And that’s not how it happens. She still has this loyalty to him. It’s nuanced. I thought that was a really interesting scene.SM I think there’s a kind of recklessness that comes after someone close to you has died. You realise your mortality – there’s a sort of liberation. That character, Alice, her mother hits her, too – and that’s conditioning.SM Interestingly enough, I’m from a West Indian family –TB Where are your family from?SM From Grenada and Trinidad.SM What’s interesting is that violence – I was beaten as a child –SM – it’s interesting how that violence is normalised.TB Things like: you don’t let anybody touch your private parts you don’t sit on a grown man’s lap. There’s a list I could run through. We all got that, and it’s an effort to keep your children safe. What happened in my case – I was six the first time – was that you have the rules, and the number one thing kids want to accomplish is not getting into trouble. We will do anything not to get in trouble.SM Right. You don’t want to get licked.TB So I have a question for you. One of the things I’m interested in is pop culture narratives around sexual violence, and the depiction of who gets to be a victim and who doesn’t. Do you feel a sense of responsibility? Do you feel a push‑pull around wanting to be a part of shifting the narrative and wanting to be super-authentic? Does that make sense?SM I think one wants to be part of shifting the narrative, absolutely. Somehow there’s got to be a way of imagining a situation where sex and the pleasures of sex are much more in balance, and much more enjoyable – where both people have equal engagement. I think that’s way more sexy.TB Yes, there’s ways to make consent sexy.SM The whole idea of men showing vulnerability is an issue. That has to be addressed – where it’s not a weakness, it’s a huge advantage. The dumbness about how this interaction has been popularised is absolutely crazy.TB To make male vulnerability sexy would be amazing. I have a friend in the BDSM world, and we had this really wonderful conversation once about what the world can learn from BDSM because it’s all based on consent.SM You’ve gone to the seed of the question. I think once people have an idea about how to talk about it, or popularise it, that’s when things will be dealt with. But it’s healing first. We can’t jump the gun.Same thing with race. Often I’ve said that, while sexual violence does not discriminate, our response is highly racial – around who gets to be a victim and who gets sympathy. We are all socialised to respond to the vulnerability of white women first. So you have the biggest names in Hollywood – they’re thin, beautiful, wealthy, glamorous white women, top of the food chain. We want to know everything about them what they eat, who they’re married to, so it’s no surprise that we’d want to know about this part of their lives that was broken, too.I definitely don’t blame them, they are also survivors. It’s not their fault the world responds to them that way. But they can also use that spotlight to amplify other folks who get less visibility.SM I just wish that could also be done racially.TB You mean, around sexual violence within race? Yes. That’s another layer to peel back. When Bill Cosby happened, there was an incredible backlash within the community. “These women are lying, he’s America’s dad,” all that. Every possible reason it wasn’t true. That was painful.TB It brought up this complicated conversation, because we know there’s a very real history of black men being falsely accused of sexual assault by white women. That’s not a debatable fact – we know it from Emmett Till. The other thing we know is that when any violence happens in a community, it’s at the hands mostly of the people in that community. So that means Asian men are raping Asian women white men are raping white women black men are raping black women. When it comes to black folks, because of that complicated history around false accusations, it becomes a shield not to deal with sexual violence at all.But what you said is right, we don’t want to take down our icons. We’re invested in their success in a way that is detrimental to our own.SM I understand it, in a way. But in order for us to grow, we have to deal with it.TB I don’t know what the solution is. If a group of black women actresses, or singers, came forward together, like with Weinstein, and said this thing happened – that would shift things so dramatically. They would still catch a hell of a backlash, more than white women. But I have based my work on the black women who did talk about their experiences. I would go into the classroom and say Mary J Blige, Queen Latifah, Oprah are all survivors of sexual violence, and they could connect to that.TB Like Ray Rice, the NFL player caught on video beating his wife. He knocked her out and dragged her out of the elevator. It was horrific. But then this thing happened where he became –TB – a monster. So your point about it coming back to race, it creates these dynamics where we’re conflicted.SM It comes back to the MeToo movement and how there’s a situation where some people don’t even know you exist. It does my head in. It all comes back to perception, to stereotypes.• This conversation appears in the ’s Weekend magazine and has been edited and abridged for length.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35fd3d188549ca8467f69431a9267e3ece358c89/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90a288bfb32c8f5754d1233f09b7b1f5","title":"im in a relationship with another man but he identifies as straight","story":"We kiss and cuddle, but he won’t go beyond a certain point physically and says he loves me as a brother. Do we have any hope of a future?Until last year, I identified as a straight man. Then, after we drank too much, I made out with a slightly older colleague, who identifies as a straight man.  We now meet to kiss and make out. He doesn’t go beyond a certain point physically. He gives me hand jobs but doesn’t want anything sexual himself, just cuddling and kissing. I love him dearly. He says he loves me, too, but as a brother or best friend, not as a partner. Recently, he has stopped kissing me on the lips but we sleep in the same bed and cuddle. I am confused. Is he straight, is he gaybi, and should I hope for romantic love with him? I love his company and we do lots together, but he will not go beyond the boundaries he has set. I don’t want to beg him to do more if he doesn’t feel comfortable, but it would hurt to walk away.This man has indicated the kind of relationship he wants, and has established control over your love-making style. But for you, an erotic exchange involves giving pleasure and receiving it. Try not to experience his sexual frugality as a rejection it could be down to embarrassment, internalised homophobia, self-punishment, fear of transmitting or contracting disease, or erectile or ejaculatory difficulties. He, too, may be confused. He may be unable to grant himself permission to cross that threshold. Consider framing your thoughts as a request, something like: “I respect your boundaries, but would be delighted if you would allow me to give you physical pleasure, too.” If he refuses, press with: “Help me to understand, what kind of feelings do you have about this? Could we talk about it?”Only you can decide if the longing you feel is too painful to continue. But learning who one is sexually, and coming to terms with it, can be challenging and take time.

She recommends adding chicken, turkey, fish, dairy products and eggs into your diet. Good sources for vegetarians and vegans are legumes, nuts, tofu and quinoa. Complex carbohydrates and iron are also important.The trichologist Anabel Kingsley notes that diet, although important, will only strengthen newly forming strands, not hair that has already grown. She says using the wrong brush is one of the most common causes of breakage, and advises using a brush with plastic, rounded prongs. Brushing hair from the ends and gently working your way to the top of the head also helps avoid snapping strands.Hairdryers and heated styling tools can leave hair brittle and lacking in shine. “Heat can, in a sense, cook the hair,” says the dermatologist Dr Zoe Draelos. “Think of it like a piece of steak – it starts out nice and soft and flexible, but when you cook it, the steak changes texture and becomes hard. Similarly, hair transforms when exposed to heat over time.” She recommends allowing hair to air dry when possible, and if using a hairdryer, to use a protective spray or serum and to start off on the lowest setting before gradually increasing the heat.Cold weather can exacerbate dandruff. Shampoos containing zinc pyrithione or salicylic acid are recommended to treat dandruff, or, for a cheaper option, try the  beauty columnist Sali Hughes’s homemade recipe: pour sea salt flakes into shampoo and rub energetically into the scalp pre-shower.Stress can cause hair loss, says Kingsley. Exercise, a healthy diet, meditation and prioritising sleep all help to de-stress body and mind.Grey hair is often finer and more fragile, but can look coarser due to oil glands producing less sebum as we age. Matt Hawes, of Josh Wood Colour, advises using a hydrating and moisturising conditioner and oils such as argan and jojoba as part of a routine to soften hair and counteract dullness. Purple- and blue-toned products are also designed to brighten grey hair.It is essential to get rid of split ends before the damage travels upwards. Charlotte Mensah, multiple winner of the best Afro hairstylist at the British Hairdressing awards, recommends a trim every six to eight weeks. “Even though it is less obvious than with straight hair, Afro hair needs to be trimmed regularly to ensure you have better curl definition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2633163db85c71a355e951a946e8561e930082f/79_273_4785_2873/master/4785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1311687b2535f9c2aa75d10ce08c0ad","title":"can i refuse to allow a letting agent to take photos of my flat","story":"I’m not comfortable having photos of my home and possessions on the internetQ I currently live in a rented flat but I am buying a house.

They do not belong to your landlord and will not be coming as part of the package to the next tenant. And you make an excellent point that it would not only better – but also less misleading – for prospective tenants to see what they are taking on in its unfurnished state.

New York was in second place with 39. London – which topped the rankings in 2015 when £2.3bn of ultra-prime properties changed hands – slipped to third place with 38 transactions.Estate agents said London had fallen out of favour with super-rich buyers due to the increase in stamp duty and concerns about Brexit.Liam Bailey, Knight Frank’s head of research, said: “The relentless creation of private wealth globally over the past decade has fuelled the growth of ultra-prime residential markets.“Despite the proliferation of ultra-prime markets across cities, second home and ski locations, our research confirms there are three undisputed leading ultra-prime markets – Hong Kong, New York and London.“While London has seen a relative decline in its lead as the world’s largest ultra-prime market, in terms of sales, Hong Kong has steadily built a commanding lead in terms of total spend by the world’s wealthy on ultra-prime property with New York growing its position as a dominant ultra-prime location.”Most of the ultra-prime sales in London were in Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, all of which are within the borough of the City of Westminster. The council last month banned the creation of new supersize properties built for the global super-rich in order to free up space for more affordable homes for “real people”. Westminster said banning “Monopoly board-style” homes would help free up more space for affordable homes for Londoners.The UK’s ranks of the ultra-rich have swelled by 400 over the last year, taking the number of people with fortunes of more than £38m ($50m) to nearly 5,000.

The former shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith was sacked for breaking that line earlier this year but more junior frontbenchers have escaped sanction.“Let’s end the economic uncertainty, let’s end the fear mongering – and let’s have a campaign on the facts,” she said. “If calls for a general election are rejected – I’ll be backing a people’s vote.”Party strategists are undecided about pursuing a formal no-confidence vote in the government if May loses the vote on her Brexit deal, one of the ways a snap general election could be triggered under the Fixed Term Parliament Act.The Democratic Unionist party, which May relies on to prop up her minority Conservative government, has vowed to vote against the Brexit deal but has said it will support the Conservatives in a no-confidence vote, meaning Labour would have to rely on Tory rebels to vote against their own party in order to pass the motion of no confidence.Labour may consider other paths, including a non-binding no-confidence motion in May herself, which Labour has previously attempted against the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, during the rail crisis.On Sunday, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, refused to confirm that Labour would table a confidence motion, saying, “let’s see what happens”.“If you can tell me whether she will still be prime minister on Tuesday evening, then perhaps I can tell you what exactly we will do next,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.Trickett sounded a note of caution against those in his party calling for a second referendum, an echo of the comments made in a private meeting by the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey.“If people feel that the privileged political elite has decided by subterfuge to find a way of reversing the previous referendum, that would cause us some difficulty, and rightly so,” he said.Both Corbyn and Labour’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, insisted on Sunday the party’s primary strategy was to renegotiate a better Brexit deal.Corbyn told ITV that the government had to “go back, negotiate something that is acceptable, which does protect rights and conditions, which does give us that trade access, or they’ve got to get out of the way, have an election so that it will be a government here that will be serious about those negotiations”.Long-Bailey repeated the insistence that a Labour-backed Brexit deal would not require the controversial backstop arrangement because it would be the party’s primary policy to keep the UK in a customs union. “The backstop was installed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. “A permanent customs union would do exactly the same thing and it would offer that long-term certainty and that is what we would go into a negotiation advocating for.”However, a customs union alone does not avoid a hard border, because of the requirement to also do some regulatory checks which form part of the EU’s single market regulation.The Conservative party chair, Brandon Lewis, called the plan “a fantasy Brexit, which the EU has repeatedly ruled out”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68eb727af573e82160256cbc9d42099b15a05388/0_198_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703be8da801810632057643958986c5d","title":"theresa may postpones brexit deal meaningful vote eu","story":"Prime minister to make statement to MPs as pound falls to lowest level in 18 monthsTheresa May has postponed the final vote on her Brexit deal after a last-minute conference call with cabinet ministers, a clear admission by the prime minister that she does not believe she can get the unpopular EU withdrawal agreement through the Commons.The drastic move, as May faced defeat by up to 100 of her own MPs, is a humiliation for the prime minister, whose aides and cabinet ministers had emphatically denied there was any prospect of pulling the vote, even as late as Monday morning.Advisers, ministers and loyalist MPs had been urging May to delay Tuesday’s vote in order to seek new assurances from Brussels and avoid the chaos of a parliamentary defeat.May is expected to confirm the vote has been delayed in an oral statement to the House of Commons at 3.30pm.It will be immediately followed by a business statement from the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, implying that she will confirm the procedural details of the postponement.The vote could take place next week or even be delayed until early January, although this would allow less time for the ensuing Brexit legislation to be passed through parliament before 29 March. The ultimate deadline for the vote is 21 January.News of the delay caused the pound to tumble to its lowest level in 18 months.The prime minister spoke to cabinet colleagues on Monday morning in a hastily arranged conference call, after apparently concluding she could not win over enough of the 100 Tory MPs who had said they were against the deal.Before that call, a cabinet source said they believed ministers would back the decision to delay the vote, but added: “She needs to have a bloody good plan B.”The children’s minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Twitter that May had “listened to colleagues” and would now “head to Brussels to push back on the backstop”.Olly Robbins, the prime minister’s Brexit negotiator, arrived in Brussels on Monday. EU sources said Downing Street was seeking extra safeguards that the “backstop” solution in the withdrawal agreement would never be triggered.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.The prime minister conducted a frantic round of telephone diplomacy over the weekend, speaking to Angela Merkel and Mark Rutte, the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands respectively, Downing Street confirmed.She had also spoken to the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the president of the European council, Donald Tusk.EU officials insisted the best they could offer would be “clarifications” of the withdrawal agreement, rather than reopening the text. The 585-page document states that both sides will make “best endeavours” towards negotiating a trade deal to ensure there is no need for the backstop – an all-UK customs union that would act as a guarantee against a hard border on the island of Ireland.Earlier on Monday, a commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: “This deal is the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate the deal that is on the table right now. That is very clear.“Our position has therefore not changed and as far as we’re concerned the UK is leaving the EU on the 29 March 2019. We are prepared for all scenarios.”That view was echoed by Varadkar, who told reporters it was not possible to renegotiate the backstop: “The reason we’ve ended up in the solution we have is because of the red lines the UK itself laid down.”He said he would not object to the issuing of statements clarifying the meaning of the agreement, but cautioned that no clarification could go against what had already been agreed.Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “I can’t follow anymore. After two years of negotiations, the Tory government wants to delay the vote. Just keep in mind that we will never let the Irish down. This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people and businesses. It’s time to make up their mind.”Jeremy Corbyn described the delay as a “desperate step”.“We have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst-of-all-worlds deal was going to be rejected by parliament because it is damaging for Britain.”Angry Tory rebels and Labour MPs said they would try to force the government to hold a vote, even though a government source said there would be no vote on a business motion to cancel Tuesday’s vote.“We are replacing the business with a new statement but it isn’t a motion and therefore isn’t votable,” the source said.Steve Baker, one of the leaders of the Conservative hard Brexit European Research Group, said the postponement was “essentially a defeat” of May’s Brexit deal.Downing Street and key ministers had repeatedly said the vote would not be delayed, in an attempt to concentrate the minds of MPs. Earlier on Monday morning, Michael Gove categorically stated the vote would go ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b736226e6b5397b8e54343b583ee71d95c98617/0_80_4652_2791/master/4652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2ed31ec794bae32695d4579474ec5dd","title":"brexit deal vote latest theresa may ecj government says ecj ruling irrelevant because uk leaving eu anyway politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenTheresa May is starting her Commons statement now.Arelene Foster, the DUP leader, has just issued this statement.The deferment of the meaningful vote just about sums up the chaotic nature of the government’s approach to these negotiations.

Here is an extract.Indeed, in Brussels this morning, the sense was that May’s last minute phone diplomacy was lacking in detailed “asks”. She also refused to share what her strategy was going to be regarding management of the Commons - both before and after the vote. May will likely respond to the overwhelming message from Tory MPs by seeking emergency talks in Brussels with European commission and council leaders before the two-day regular summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday. But we remain of the view that any substantive reopening of the withdrawal agreement is unlikely. EU leaders will not be pleased with new demands from May, especially as she only signed off on the deal a few weeks ago.This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.This is from my colleague Severin Carrell.Although the ECJ has delivered its judgment in this case, which is the important bit, the case still has to go back to the court in Edinburgh to be finalised.Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, told BBC News that the party wants the EU to make concessions on the backstop. He said: Unless we’ve got the agreement to a point where it can get a majority in the House of Commons, there is no point in having the vote tomorrow.Asked about the current mood in the Tory party, Brady said: I think we are looking for progress on the agreement and hoping we can get to a point where we can support the government and get this matter through and settled.When it was put to him that the EU appears determined not to budge, Brady said: We are also told that the EU doesn’t like the backstop. We are told by the attorney general the backstop is actually illegal under EU law. It would be very odd to insist on it being permanent and it’s against the law.And this is from Arlene Foster, the DUP’s leader at Westminster.Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader in the House of Commons, has called Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney “good negotiators” in a rare moment of praise for his counterparts in Ireland.Asked by the BBC about the taoiseach’s statement today that the withdrawal agreement would not be re-opened because of turmoil in Wesminster, Dodds replied: It doesn’t surprise me at all that the Irish taioseach and the foreign minister take this attitude. They are good negotiators.

So much of life is within the Earth rather than on top of it.”The team combines 1,200 scientists from 52 countries in disciplines ranging from geology and microbiology to chemistry and physics. A year before the conclusion of their 10-year study, they will present an amalgamation of findings to date before the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting opens this week.Samples were taken from boreholes more than 5km deep and undersea drilling sites to construct models of the ecosystem and estimate how much living carbon it might contain.One organism found 2.5km below the surface has been buried for millions of years and may not rely at all on energy from the sun. Instead, the methanogen has found a way to create methane in this low energy environment, which it may not use to reproduce or ide, but to replace or repair broken parts.Lloyd said: “The strangest thing for me is that some organisms can exist for millennia. They are metabolically active but in stasis, with less energy than we thought possible of supporting life.”Rick Colwell, a microbial ecologist at Oregon State University, said the timescales of subterranean life were completely different. Some microorganisms have been alive for thousands of years, barely moving except with shifts in the tectonic plates, earthquakes or eruptions.“We humans orientate towards relatively rapid processes – diurnal cycles based on the sun, or lunar cycles based on the moon – but these organisms are part of slow, persistent cycles on geological timescales.”Underworld biospheres vary depending on geology and geography. Their combined size is estimated to be more than 2bn sq km, but this could be expanded further in the future.The researchers said their discoveries were made possible by two technical advances: drills that can penetrate far deeper below the Earth’s crust, and improvements in microscopes that allow life to be detected at increasingly minute levels.The scientists have been trying to find a lower limit beyond which life cannot exist, but the deeper they dig the more life they find. There is a temperature maximum – currently 122C – but the researchers believe this record will be broken if they keep exploring and developing more sophisticated instruments.Mysteries remain, including whether life colonises up from the depths or down from the surface, how the microbes interact with chemical processes, and what this might reveal about how life and the Earth co-evolved.The scientists say some findings enter the realm of philosophy and exobiology – the study of extraterrestrial life.Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution for Science, said: “We must ask ourselves: if life on Earth can be this different from what experience has led us to expect, then what strangeness might await as we probe for life on other worlds?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebf28f53b1070caf8a100c3b41d68b5135f2dd2/0_40_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4abe6823c79ca087485eed7ad922434","title":"what happens when your child becomes violent with you","story":"Under my desk is an antique iron. It has been there since the day my mother hid it from my teenage son. That day, attempts to get him up had repeatedly failed. He was hungry but refused to eat, he became increasingly volatile until eventually he threatened to hurl the iron at my head.I’d had enough objects thrown at me in the past to not take any chances. I ran out of the house and for the first time called the police. While I waited for them, my son punched through a window, the resulting cut narrowly missing his artery.Tom, 17, has various diagnoses – autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette’s, ADHD – that make it hard for him to communicate, deal with frustration and regulate his emotions. As he has grown older, he has become more challenging. He was exhibiting a range of coercive and obsessive behaviours centred on me that made life intolerable. I had a choice around these behaviours: I could carry them out … or else.“Or else” could mean screaming for hours, punching, kicking, threatening with heavy or sharp objects, property damaged – or me, my other children – and neighbours kept awake into the early hours and sometimes all night. “Or else” could mean my son harming himself it was the unspoken catalyst to my life shutting down.While some may find this shocking, for others it’s a familiar story. A freedom of information request last year revealed that in the year 201516, 10,051 cases of domestic violence against adults by children were investigated by 35 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Of these cases, 874 led to cautions being issued and 1,459 to juveniles being charged with offences.“My feeling is that it is more widespread,” says social worker and CPV campaigner Helen Bonnick. “I am seeing lots of links with CPV and children and young people’s mental health – so if, as we are told, that is worsening you would expect there to be a knock-on effect.”CPV and APV are more prevalent in particular groups – children with mental health problems or special needs the adoption and fostering communities families that have experienced domestic violence and where young people are abusing substances.Children within these risk groups may have “several overlapping issues”, says Bonnick. Early trauma, such as neglect or living with domestic violence, may have affected the way they react to stress – or had a modelling effect. Children who are abusing substances may lash out while intoxicated or demand money for drugs. Like Tom, those with mental health issues may be living with such high levels of anxiety that it takes very little to tip them into fight, flight or freeze.“Fundamentally,” says Bonnick, “we see young people who are trying to cope with the demands of life, and are having to ‘speak loudly’ to have their needs met. They may find stressful situations extremely hard to manage because of a neurological condition or early trauma. They may have learned that violence pays off in achieving certain ends.”However, CPV and APV is not exclusive to these groups. Rachel Condry found that APV occurred across the social spectrum and that while it is more commonly against mothers by sons, a significant proportion of fathers were victims and daughters perpetrators. In some families there was a clear cause, in others Condry said she “literally could not find a reason”.Tip of the iceberg What is clear, is that the problem is much wider than reported – “for very understandable reasons”, says Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives. “Those who experience intimate partner violence only call the police at a rate of one in five. We can all see the reasons why you would be even less likely to call the police about your child – and not just the police – there is so much attached in terms of any stigma people feel, and in terms of worries about consequences for themselves and the child.”Shame and fear can prevent parents seeking the help they need – as can lack of understanding from family, friends and agencies. “The kind of dismissiveness people in previous times applied to intimate partner violence is still applied to CPV,” says Jacob. “People end up minimising what is actually an incredibly serious issue in somebody’s home.”The insidious nature of domestic abuse also plays its part. “It can build up gradually,” says Bonnick, who runs the campaigning and resource website Holes in the Wall. “It takes a while to acknowledge that you are being abused … because it’s become so normal,” she says.Her observation resonates. I once described to a friend the lengths I had to go to in order to have a shower – reasons that included sleeping as long as I could after being awake most of the night, and also because often Tom would repeatedly batter the bathroom door. “You do realise,” she said after a long silence, “how very far from normal your life has become?”I did, and didn’t. In fact, all of us – my son, myself, and my two younger teenage children – existed in a kind of suspended reality. The scale of how wrong things were meant that when I did start contacting agencies for help, I found it almost impossible to articulate the problems.And in common with many, I had an uphill job getting people to really hear what was happening.“I think often people do ask for help and get knocked back – passed from one agency to another,” says Bonnick. “It can be very difficult to find where to go in the first place, and then even if you do approach an agency, what sort of help do you get?”It’s a good question. The reality is that there is no national blueprint for dealing with CPV and the quality of help families receive is patchy. “What you get is pockets of good practice,” says Condry, “but a lot of areas where there is practically nothing.”“There has been a massive retraction of funding for child and adolescent mental health and local services, and cuts in youth justice as well.”Last summer Jacob, Condry and Bonnick all took part in the consultation for the government’s draft domestic abuse and violence legislation. They are unclear as to whether CPV will make its first appearance in a domestic violence bill. And while there are benefits to it being included, such as raising its profile, Bonnick is wary about drawing too many parallels with adult abuse.“There is a problem with identifying with adult perpetrators because we might not want to get sucked into the sort of response that is considered appropriate for that. Children are still young and growing, and habits are not so fixed. There is much more hope for change.’Whole family protection Inclusion in the bill might, however, be a step towards families accessing the help they need.I am convinced that our own situation only changed because I started to call the police. Concerns followed about the welfare of my younger children. Our case was presented at the monthly Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (Marac), which put pressure on services to act. I was allocated an independent domestic violence advocate (Idva) from an organisation called Splitz, which offers support services to people experiencing domestic abuse. We met regularly and her support was crucial in keeping our case on the radar.Chrissy Stower, area manager for Splitz, says that while recognition of the problem has improved, there is still a long way to go.“The system is geared up for parent on child abuse, not the other way round,” she says. “This is seen as a ‘parenting’ issue with the child not being seen as being at risk from the parent. We have to expend a lot of energy in making the case to achieve support for child on parent abuse cases.”Condry agrees: “We’ve heard of families who have gone to social services and been told there’s no younger siblings in the family so it’s not a protection issue. We would argue very strongly that if a young person is being violent in the family there’s a massive safeguarding issue because he or she is not developing in a way they should be.”Condry is also clear that seeing CPV as a parenting issue is an over-simplification. “I am really reluctant to dwell on explanations that involve blaming parents,” she says. “There are so many complexities in families that this happens to.“It’s impossible to work with this by adjusting your behaviour, filling out a worksheet or trying to lay down boundaries,” she says. “That sort of thing is not going to work if someone has lived under siege for a couple of years.”“Burnout” is the phrase Condry says parents used often in her research to describe the impact of APV. At the family level, child to parent violence contributes to family breakdown, economic hardship and mental health problems.My relationship with Tom’s father did not survive our disagreements over how to handle him. As Tom’s violence and coercive behaviour became worse, I watched my other children fall apart, one began to behave self-destructively and the other withdrew further into his phone.I could barely work because I was getting so little sleep, and because Tom’s coercive behaviours took up so much time. I tried to visit my GP to talk about my own mental health, but all I could do was sob wordlessly. And all the while, I worried desperately about Tom – my inability to place boundaries meant that he was putting himself at risk, mixing with people who were exploiting him, and dabbling in drugs. “What medication are you on,” an attending police officer asked me one night. “None,” I replied. “Then how are you still standing?” he asked.And there is a wider social cost to consider. In research published in 2009, Syliva Walby, distinguished professor in sociology at the University of Lancaster, found that domestic violence and abuse cost the UK an estimated £15.7bn in 2008. If CPV is now as widespread as some people believe, then the associated costs to the economy will be significant.“You would imagine that if you did apply the economic cost of CPV and APV it would be massive,” says Condry. “Somebody who works in the youth justice field told me his suspicion was that a very large number of kids taken into care, especially in the 14-plus age range, would be due to family breakdown because of violence in the home,” she adds.Fund support services“There is a good case to be made for support services being funded to save a lot of money in the long run,” says Condry.It is clear to me that support services are not getting the funding they need now. I sensed frustration among the police officers attending us that they were working with blunt tools and being left to make difficult judgment calls. Emergency foster and respite centres had been closed, so they were faced with the tough choices of putting a vulnerable youth in a cell, sectioning him, or walking away.Tom was moved out of our home in the summer. My life now is radically different. I can work, I can even go out for the evening. But I still can’t sleep. Putting my child into care was searingly painful. I am often paralysed by recriminations, guilt and despair. I no longer look at baby pictures.Tom lives in his placement on the other side of our town. He is bewildered, angry and doesn’t properly understand why he is there. His capacity to make sense of what is happening to him is limited, and he is unable or unwilling to face up to his actions, leaving little room for us to repair our badly broken relationship.As Tom approaches adulthood, my influence over what happens to him will decline dramatically. I had always envisaged that I would house and care for him for as long as he needed me. Without my support, I fear greatly for his future – with it, I fear for mine.If you have been affected by the issues in this article, please visit holesinthewall or safelives.org.uk.

We are witnessing the start of an all-time great careerHalf human, half amazing, Patrick Mahomes cemented himself as the league’s MVP on a wild, wacky NFL Sunday. Mahomes overcame a talented Baltimore defense, as the Chiefs beat the Ravens 27-24 to wrap up a spot in the playoffs.Mahomes’ brilliance is hard to explain, even harder to exaggerate. He is bending the boundaries of what is plausible on the football field. Only Aaron Rodgers is able to match the first-year starter’s blend of athleticism, precision and playmaking magic. Nobody has a more impressive arm than Mahomes. Baltimore entered Sunday as the fourth-best defense in the league by DVOA. Mahomes promptly set to work dissecting it, conjuring all kinds of magic, including no-look passes than had more than a whiff of sorcery:That’s not an optical illusion. That’s something he practiced in college and has perfected in the pros. How do you even think about defending that? Simple: you don’t.Mahomes-MVP detractors have pointed to the Chiefs’ offensive system and the quarterback’s all-star cast. Andy Reid’s brand of organized disorder has indeed put Mahomes in excellent spots. Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, and Kareem Hunt, prior to his release, made the whole scheme sing. Sunday was different. Hunt is no longer with the team, released after a video surfaced of him pushing then kicking a woman at a Cleveland hotel. His replacement, Spencer Ware, along with Hill, missed time against the Ravens due to injury.Baltimore forced KC to play a different kind of game. On defense, they came after Mahomes. He looked bamboozled at times by the Raven’s varied fronts and pressure packages. Baltimore blitzed defenders from anywhere and everywhere. Mahomes had a hard time figuring out who was coming, and his offensive line was overwhelmed.It would have been easy for Mahomes to fold, but that’s never been his way. He continued to drive the Chiefs down the field, showing the kind of poise we’ve become accustomed to, as he led a pair of potential game-winning drives. When the team needed him, he put them on his back:There is nobody, not even Rodgers, who would have the audacity and arm arrogance to attempt that throw with the game on the line. In one play, Mahomes showcased what makes him special: his intelligence throwing from awkward arm angles throwing off-platform raw, unadulterated arm strength and athleticism. We are witnessing the start of an all-time great career.The Dolphins last-second miracle had a little bit of everything. The highlight: Rob Gronkowski flailing around as the Patriots’ deep safety. The Hard Rock Stadium miracle (we need a better, non-corporate, name) will join the likes of Marino’s fake spike, the Holy Roller, and the Miracle at the Meadowlands as the greatest plays to end a regular season game.Not content with that, the Football Gods gave us more lateral madness later in the day. The Steelers hit a perfect hook-and-ladder with time winding down in Oakland to move the team into field goal position, looking to tie the game:Kicker Chris Boswell slipped on the subsequent kick. Football is silly.George Kittle, San Francisco 49ers. Kittle almost broke the single-game tight end record for receiving yards in a half. He posted seven catches for 210-yards and a touchdown in the first half of the Niners win over the Broncos. Kittle fell five yards short of breaking Shannon Sharpe’s record after he was shutout in the second half.How about a pair of Saquon Barkley gems? Barkley now has four touchdown runs of 50 or more yards this season. The Giants had three touchdown runs of 50 or more yards in the previous 10 seasons. His latest, a 78-yard beauty:No Giants rookie has ever scored more touchdowns than Barkley – 13. And he still has three games to go.“I want to sincerely apologize for my inappropriate and unacceptable tweets. I was a 16-year-old kid in high school who clearly made bad choices. Those words do not reflect who I am today.” – Baltimore Ravens fullbackdefensive lineman Patrick Richard after racist tweets he posted in 2011 and 2012 were unearthed.The Richard incident comes the same week as Heisman trophy winner Kyler Murray apologized for homophobic tweets he posted when he was 14, and after Kevin Hart withdrew from the Oscars after complaints about homophobic tweets he posted in 2014.How does this keep happening? Any agent who doesn’t immediately scrub the social media history of their clients – particularly those posted when said athletecelebrity was a high schooler – is derelict in duty. That should be day-one of the pre-draft process. The positive: in outing their racism, homophobia andor misogyny in a public setting, the ignorant can be challenged and, hopefully, educated.- We’ve seen some brilliant offense this season but the Bears showed defense can still win you games after they smothered the Rams on Sunday Night Football. They picked off Jared Goff four times as they won 15-6 – and the Rams won’t relish facing them again in the playoffs.- Packers interim coach Joe Philbin used both his challenges in the first 83 seconds of his debut. Both rulings stood. Welcome back, coach. At least he scored a comfortable win over the Falcons, 34-20.- Fun fact: Christian McCaffrey, Weeks 1-6: 1 TD. Christian McCaffrey, Weeks 7-14: 12 TD. The Panthers all-everything weapon is more than empty calories. At this point, he is the Panthers offense.- When was the last time an in-season moved re-vitalized an entire franchise like Dallas’ acquisition of Amari Cooper? Cooper had another big game against Philadelphia, catching 10 passes for 217-yards and three touchdowns. He’s brought some juice to a Cowboys offense that was pedestrian before his arrival. The entire team has responded.- Dallas winning on a should-be interception against the Eagles, tipped into the hands of Cooper, is the perfect microcosm of the NFC East this season.- In an era where we get to feast on quarterback play – the passing game being king – the Ravens run-only offense is a refreshing side dish. Baltimore’s offense is limited with Lamar Jackson at quarterback, but it’s much more fun. The Ravens pushed the Chiefs to the brink thanks to the offenses ability to control the clock and keep Patrick Mahomes off the field. Jackson brings an electricity to the offense, he should keep the starting quarterback job even when Joe Flacco is cleared to return.- Houston’s nine-game win streak came to an end in Indianapolis. The Texans have played in nine one-score games this season and entered the week 11th in overall DVOA. They’re closer to a .500 team than their record indicates.- Here is the stat line from Washington starting quarterback Mark Sanchez against the Giants: 614, 38-yards, 0 touchdowns, two interceptions. It was almost impossibly bad. But, hey, at least he knows the offense, right? Colin Kaepernick had a better passer rating sat on his sofa. Washington’s decision not to even reach out to Kaepernick remains indefensible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c3c189daac3768a3d656722a4e4eb67a8b8bbf9/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b848d21ddbe3a3c02cb84cf1a9bf914","title":"sleeping beauty review theatre royal stratford east","story":"Theatre Royal Stratford East, LondonCharles Perrault meets Doctor Who in this lively production about a cockney martial-arts princess who travels through timePantomime survives by being infinitely flexible. This version of Sleeping Beauty, with book and lyrics by Sarah A Nixon and Mark Chatterton, is a plot-driven affair worlds away from the ramshackle entertainments I saw as a child, but, mixing antique fairytale and futuristic fantasy, it still palpably works on a young audience.The first half sticks to the original tale, with a princess threatened with death by pricking her finger on a spinning-wheel: the big difference is that her parents, a pearly king and queen, seek to avoid the curse by camping out in Epping Forest.There are plenty of traditional panto elements. Shaun Prendergast is a robustly saucy Queen Pearl, flirting with a second-row spectator and reminding us that her greengrocer offered to show her his King Edwards. Josephine Melville is also wonderfully full-blooded as the wicked fairy, signalling her villainy by concocting potions straight out of Macbeth (“eye of newt”) and by announcing her enthusiasm for Brexit.Things turn stranger in the second half. In an effort to thwart the malediction, the princess and her beau travel in a time capsule 100 years hence, only to find the wicked fairy has used technology to brainwash the whole world. I sensed a contradiction between the idea of a future in which we are enslaved by screens and the story’s relish for a video game like Fortnite. But, even if the plot gets a bit baffling, Robert Hyman’s eclectic score, including a version of Uptown Funk, swings merrily along Lily Arnold’s design evokes an Alphaville-like future and Matthew Xia’s production gets lively performances from the cast. Rejecting Disneyesque soppiness, Ericka Posadas is a martial-arts princess who finally rejects her royal status. Anthony Rickman as her boyfriend is no sweet prince but a mutated bird. And Alice Frankham puts in a number of striking appearances as a beaky crow and a dancing queen.This is very much a panto for the present day, in which a Perrault fairytale is cross-fertilised with Doctor Who."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

The 61-year-old’s body has still not been found and is thought by Turkish investigators to have been dissolved in acid.According to a purported transcript of an audio recording of Khashoggi’s killing central to Turkey’s case against Saudi Arabia and shared with CNN, the journalist recognises someone whom CNN identifies as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a former Saudi diplomat and intelligence official working for Prince Mohammed.After an exchange in which Mutreb allegedly says, “You’re coming back” and Khashoggi replies, “You can’t do that, there are people waiting outside for me”, the transcript describes noises consistent with a scuffle and Khashoggi says, “I can’t breathe” several times.The recording then captures the sounds of screams and gasps and then noises identified as “sawing” and “cutting”.A voice that Turkish authorities have previously identified as Dr Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, the head of forensic medicine at Saudi Arabia’s interior ministry, says, “If you don’t like the noise, put your earphones in or listen to music like me” during the dismemberment.Mutreb makes several phone calls, including one Turkey says was made to a member of the Saudi royal court, in which he says “tell yours”, believed to mean Prince Mohammed, “The thing is done, it is done.”Turkey has refused to say how the audio recording was obtained, although its existence has been confirmed by Erdoğan and western officials, who also say they have listened to it.The office of a US senator briefed on the ongoing investigation by the CIA director, Gina Haspel, told CNN the transcript was consistent with that briefing.Monday’s revelations came after a Republican senator rebuked the White House over its handling of the affair, after reports that Jared Kushner had counselled Prince Mohammed over the fallout from the journalist’s murder.The administration has acknowledged one call between the two men since Khashoggi’s disappearance, on 9 October, joined by the national security adviser, John Bolton. Citing “American officials and a Saudi briefed on their conversations”, the NYT said Kushner and Prince Mohammed have “continued to chat informally”.Citing the unnamed Saudi source, the paper said, “Kushner has offered the crown prince advice about how to weather the storm, urging him to resolve his conflicts around the region and avoid further embarrassments”.The US Senate is due to vote on Monday on a resolution to direct the removal of American forces from the Saudi-led war in Yemen, unless authorised by Congress. A resolution condemning Prince Mohammed is also expected to be voted on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc269cdb5a087e1936898d64cf2efe2244c2e600/0_238_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02b875b54d177b9e9937718b71514d4e","title":"taj mahal ticket price rise indian visitors","story":"Hike is latest attempt to limit footfall after experts say flow of people causing irreversible damage Indians make up the majority of the Taj Mahal’s 10,000-15,000 average daily visitors.

She said bankers had been charmed by a “glamorous, flashy, famous, bejewelled, bodyguarded, ostensibly billionaire playboy” into losing their common sense.Mallya is alleged to have knowingly misled largely state-owned banks about the fortunes of the failing airline, before laundering the cash to fund his Formula 1 motor racing team and other projects.India’s enforcement directorate has been investigating the tycoon’s debts linked to the airline, which amount to £977m.A lawyer for Mallya previously argued that the fraud allegations were politically motivated and fitted a pattern of corruption charges surfacing in Indian election years.The Central Bank of India opened a criminal investigation into Mallya in 2015, and the politan police’s extradition unit arrested him in April last year on behalf of the Indian authorities. He had entered the UK on a valid passport in March 2016.Mallya barely reacted as the judge delivered her ruling.He was once hailed as India’s version of the British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson for his investments in the airline, a Formula 1 team and an Indian Premier League cricket club."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3720094.1543944465!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"christmas present ideas these 19 toys never go out of fashion","story":"Conor Pope joins Christmas shoppers in Dublin city centre and asks them about their best and worst Christmas presents.

Some of the most ubiquitous toys which will find themselves under Christmas trees are there by design but as many again found their way into our world by complete chance. And at least one started out as a purely adults-only notion.Monopoly: It might seem like a simple board game which sees people attempt to crush the hopes and dreams of people they love, but it started out with quite a different purpose. In 1903 Elizabeth Magie invented what she called Landlord’s Game in an attempt to show how an economy focused on broad wealth creation was better than an economy which rewarded monopolists. Fast-forward 30 years and her little-known game was rediscovered by a not entirely lovely sounding man called Charles Darrow. He tweaked it and then sold it to Parker Brothers. Darrow made millions, Magie made nothing.\u0026nbspSlime: Anyone as old as Pricewatch will recall that this vile substance first became a thing in the mid-1970s and back then it came in a lurid green trash can. It was made by Mattel and consisted of a non-toxic squishy green material what would almost always attract hairs and fluff within seconds of being decanted from its can. Slime bubbled under for many years until exploded on the scene again in recent years. The range includes DIY kits, factories and unicorns that poop slime. Yay.Rubik’s Cube: This infuriatingly complicated “toy” was conceived by a 29-year-old Hungarian sculptor and architecture lecturer called Erno Rubik in 1974 but did not become an overnight sensation for six years when it started popping up at international toy fairs. It won the German toy of the year award in 1980 and suddenly the cube was everywhere. It has never gone away and over the last 40 years close to half a billion of the things have been sold. There are world championships now and everything and some people can solve the puzzle in less than a minute. Pricewatch, on the other hand, has been trying and failing to solve it since 1981.Subbuteo: This table football game which sat little plastic men on heavy rounded plastic bases was invented by a former RAF pilot called Peter Adolph just after the second World War. It took 25 years for it to become a real hit and it had 15 years in the sun before its popularity waned – despite featuring prominently in Half Man Half Biscuit and Undertones songs in the 1980s. It returned to our world in 2012 and continues to sell well.Chess: The game was born in India more than 1,500 year ago and evolved into a form we would sort of recognise in Spain in the 15th century. Its rules were standardised in the 19th century and it hasn’t changed a whole lot since then. It remains wildly popular as a gift and a good way for computers and small children to show off their intelligence.The yo-yo: This might be one of the oldest game in the world and Grecian urns dating back to more than 400 years BC depict people playing with the thing on the string. The first yo-yo maker of modern times was a man called Pedro Flores, a Filipino who moved to the United States and set about making his fortune in 1928. It has had plenty of ups and downs (ha!) from then until the 1970s when the little device became wildly popular with tournaments and tricks and yo-yo celebrities and all manner of other madness surrounding it. It is still a staple of Christmas stockings everywhere.Barbie: Mattel brought this little doll into our world in 1959 and she hasn’t looked back since. She was conceived by a woman called Ruth Handler who had, as her inspiration, a German doll with the considerably less catchy name of Bild Lilli. More than a billion Barbies have now been sold in more than 150 countries and while other dolls have come and gone and then come again, Barbie and all her spin-offs keep on trucking.Putty: Any parent who has spent hours picking putty from rugs, hair and dog fur will sigh at the mere mention of the word. All the heartache could have been avoided had James Wright, who was working as an engineer with the US war production board, not dropped boric acid into silicone oil. What resulted was a stretchy and bouncy substance that had no practical use in war. Several years later, a businessman called Peter Hodgson happened upon it and saw its potential as a child’s toy. It has gone on to become one of the biggest-selling products aimed at children over the last 50 years. And it has gone all high-tech and high-priced in recent years and some fancy metallic putties can cost as much as €20.Trivial Pursuit: While Trivial Pursuit has no doubt been behind countless post-Christmas fights since the world fell in love with the trivia game in 1984, its popularity shows no sign of waning and there have been countless spin-offs covering everything from Game of Thrones to Harry Potter. The game was invented by Canadians Chris Haney and Scott Abbott, who made mountains of money from it for nearly a quarter of a century – sales have now topped €1 billion – before selling the rights to Hasbro a decade ago for $80 million.Top Trumps: On so many levels this is a ridiculous game. You get cards which list the vital statistics of sports stars, or cars or Harry Potter characters or Disney princesses and then you pit your cards against the cards your friends have to see ends up with all the cards. It celebrates its 50th birthday this Christmas. The cards were first published by Dubreq which is also credited with releasing the Stylophone into the wild. Dubreq was taken over by Waddingtons and then, in the late 1990s, the rights to the game were bought by Winning Moves, which is also the company behind the recently-released Dublin version of Monopoly.GI JoeAction Man: The dolls for boys – as this product was never marketed – went by the name GI Joe in the US and Action Man in this part of the world. Hasbro marketed the doll as an “action figure” rather than a doll. When such products were first made available in this part of the world the range was pretty limited – there were soldiers and sailors but as the 1960s became the 1970s the range grew and grew and included everything from soldiers to scientists to Arctic explorers.Hula hoop: Invented in 1957, by Arthur K “Spud” Melin and Richard Knerr, this weird marriage of Hawaiian hula dancing and plastic became one of the biggest fads of all time. More than 100 million were sold in the 10 years from the late 1960s and while its popularity waned in the 1980s, the hula hoop has never gone away and the plastic rings still sell by the truckload.Etch-a-Sketch: As with many of the best and most enduring games in our world, the Etch-a-Sketch was invented by accident. In the mid-1950s a French electrician called André Cassagnes was installing a factory light switch plate and sketched some of the details he needed to make it work on its translucent decal. When he peeled the decal off the switch plate, he saw the drawings he had done had been copied onto the opposite side to the one he had actually drawn on. And that was his light-bulb moment. He called his invention the L’Écran Magique – or the magic screen. He brought it to a German toy fair where it was seen by a US company who took a punt on it. Since the 1960s, about 200 million of the things have been sold.Lego: The name comes from the Danish words for “play well” and rarely has a game deserved its name as much as this. It was invented by a great Dane called Ole Christiansen in 1949 and the Lego company patented the idea nine years later. In the early days, the bricks were red and white and there was no such thing as instructions or designs. Today, Lego comes with complex instructions which make Ikea flat-pack furniture seem as simple as a Peter and Jane book and everything from playhouses for princesses to replicas of wonders of the world to ships from the star fleet can be assembled.Slinky: Yet another toy that was created by accident. Credit this time goes to mechanical engineer Richard James, who was trying fine tune a set of sensitive springs to keep fragile equipment steady on ships during the second World War. He stumbled and knocked one of his springs off a shelf and was amazed as it effectively walked down from its spot instead of just falling to the ground as you might expect. The product was christened by his wife and he started selling it in 1945. Since then more than 300 million of his toys have been sold – not to mention all the cheap knock-offs.Pop-up books: Perhaps one of the most enduring Christmas presents of all time is the humble book. Something which has stood tall in the face of threats of the electronic world although some of its lunch has been eaten by the likes of the Kindle in recent years. The pop-up book is among the most popular presents for small children. You might be surprised to know that the history of the pop-up goes back to the 14th century and – if the internet is to be believed (and who are we to doubt it) – credit for their creation must go to a Catalan mystic who used revolving disks to illustrate his theories. Fast-forward more than 400 years to the early part of the 19th century when pop-up books started being made for children. First there was the flap technique then, just under 100 years ago, pop-ups as we know them started appearing. The  Children’s Annual No 1 is said to be the first mainstream pop-up book to feature complex illustrations which literally leapt off the page.Nintendo: In the late 1970s, Pong was the height of high tech and children everywhere were – frankly – amazed as white paddles moved up on down a black screen sort of replicating tennis. Fast forward five years when the Commodore 64 came along and improved gaming – slowly, very, very slowly. Then, in the late 1980s, Nintendo developed a games console that changed the gaming world forever. In the United States in 1988 one out of every six dollars spent on toys went on consoles and Nintendo’s revenue came to to $1.7 billion. A year later it released its Game Boy and changed the game again. This year one of the big Christmas sellers is likely to be a retro Nintendo games console, which shows that old-school games still have a place in the world of online gaming and incredibly lifelike alternatives.My Little Pony: The ponies became a runaway hit from the early 1980s but their popularity waned in the early 1990s and in the normal course of events that would have been that. An attempt was made to revive the notion in the late 1990s but the kids were not having it. That should definitely have been that. A further attempt to make My Little Pony great again failed in 2003 and that should most definitely have been that. It wasn’t though. Makers Hasbro came back to the trough in 2010 and this time it worked. In 2013, $650 million worth of Little Ponies were flogged worldwide, with sales jumping to more than $1 billion in subsequent years.The bicycle: You might think that bikes and children are natural bedfellows. Well, they’re not. In fact, the bike was an exclusively adult notion for the first 50 or 60 years of its life. A company called Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward were the first large makers to settle on the idea of making bicycles for children. Production started in earnest after the second World War but it wasn’t until the 1950s that children’s bicycles were more common than adult ones."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3726025.1544434592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland ranked worst in eu for performance on climate action","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters hold placards during a march for the climate on sidelines of the COP24 summit on December 8th in Katowice, Poland. Photograph:  Janek Skarzynski Getty Images Ireland’s performance on climate action in response to global warming has been ranked as the worst in the EU and among the worst in the world in a major international assessment.The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2019 concludes existing climate mitigation efforts in reducing carbon emissions “will not enable Ireland to achieve either its EU 2020 or 2030 targets”.The report examines a total of 56 developed countries plus the EU average, and ranks them across a number of criteria to assess the extent to which their actions and commitments are in line with commitments under the 2015 Paris Accord to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.The CCPI has tracked countries’ performance for the past 14 years. It is jointly published by Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network, and is regarded as the most authoritative assessment of climate performance published annually.A long-standing lack of implementation of substantive measures to put the country on a well below 2 degree pathway “results in a very low rating for Ireland’s national policy performance”, according to its latest evaluation published at UN climate summit in Katowice in Poland on Monday.Reacting to the latest rankings, An Taisce’s Climate Change Committee spokesman John Gibbons said it was “another deeply embarrassing blow to Ireland’s reputation as a good faith actor in terms of doing its fair share in tackling the global climate crisis”.The best cumulative score in the index is achieved by Sweden (76.28). The UK, ranks eighth, with a score of 65.92. The EU average score was 60.65. Ireland, in contrast, ranked 48th on the list, with a score of just 40.84, far below the EU average.Commenting on Ireland, the CCPI says it “still rated as the worst-performing EU country in the CCPI. . .and remains in the group of very-low-performing countries”.The performance in the greenhouse gas emissions category is rated “very low” and the country is also low-ranking performers in the “energy use” category.There is recognition, however, of increased deployment of renewable energy share over the past five years, and forthcoming support schemes for renewable heat and renewable electricity “which recognise the value of citizen and community participation”. As a consequence, the Republic is rated “medium” in the renewable energy category.“National experts commend the Irish parliament for its leadership in deciding to pass the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill, which is the first of its kind in the world, and for the innovative Citizens’ Assembly process which produced far-reaching recommendations for climate action now being considered by a special parliamentary committee working on the development of Ireland’s National Energy and Climate Plan,” it adds.Therefore, the performance on international climate policy is rated medium. “However, existing climate mitigation efforts will not enable Ireland to achieve either its EU 2020 or 2030 targets domestically. The long-standing lack of implementation of substantive measures to put the country on a well-below-2 degrees pathway results in a very low rating for Ireland’s national policy performance.”Not enough countries “prove political will to prevent dangerous climate change”, while global CO2 emissions are rising again after three consecutive years of stability, it warns.Only a few countries have started to implement strategies to limit global warming below 2 or even 1.5 degrees. While there is a continued growth and competitiveness of renewable energy, the CCPI “shows a lack of political will of most governments to phase out fossil fuels with the necessary speed”.Co-author Jan Burck of Germanwatch said: “Based on techno-economic developments delay in implementation of low-carbon solutions can hardly be justified. While the G20 summit has shown strong support of 19 countries to support the Paris Agreement, the political will of those Governments to set the right frameworks and incentives for its national implementation is not yet reflected in these words.”Before Paris, the world was heading to 4 to 5 degrees of global warming, “now we are still on a path to more than 3 degrees still a catastrophic perspective”, he said.The costs of electricity from wind and solar have dropped by about a third since then, “so all countries can increase ambition and pace”, said Prof Niklas Höhne, co-author from NewClimate Institute.In 40 of the 56 analysed countries, emissions decreased between 2011 and 2016. However, investments in fossil fuel infrastructure are “leading to a high risk of a lock-in into high emissions pathways”.The EU now “needs to enhance its current climate commitment to show leadership”, said Stephan Singer from the Climate Action Network.The top three places in the CCPI are unoccupied, because none of the 56 countries or the EU are clearly on a well below a 2-degree pathway in overall performance.Ireland is in the group of very low performers including Japan (49th) Turkey (50th), Russia (52nd), Canada (54th), Australia (55th), Korea (57th), the US (59th) and Saudi Arabia (60th)."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Harris says the 300 women who travel for terminations each month will have options in StateDavid Sutton (42) sued Kingswood FC for fielding player with \u0026lsquoa violent propensity\u0026rsquoSimon Coveney proposes former Labour Party leader for Brussels-based postTheresa May to make statement to MPs at 3.30pm on exiting the European Union\u0026lsquoThere are those who now openly deny rights won through long and difficult struggles and who glory in discrimination, racism and a crude, xenophobic form of nationalism\u0026rsquoSupermarket one of 13 businesses served with closure orders in November by FSAIWarren Nolan is found guilty of murdering Alan O\u0026rsquoNeill outside Dublin house in 2015Stephen Warren (45) has not been seen since leaving wedding reception on SundayBackstop should not be seen as a concession by one side to the other, T\u0026aacutenaiste saysState\u0026rsquos performance also among worst in the world in a major international assessmentMaureen O\u0026rsquoSullivan renews call for ban \u0026ndash Ireland one of three EU states to allow meetsNational Treatment Purchase Fund to provide funding as part of winter surge planBusinesses to press Government to disclose no-deal plans if Brexit deal is voted downRoscommon practice is at centre of claims of money being taken from client accountsAppointment of Jess Kenny is in response to increasing number of homeless patientsThe schools will be based in areas of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and CorkLegislation\u0026rsquos passage could be delayed due to the number of Amendments tabledMove follows C\u0026ampAG report into controversial spending practices at universityStatue will honour 3,500 killed for defending human rights"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3726314.1544455571!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit commons vote on withdrawal agreement postponed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street on Monday amid reports that a crucial House of Commons vote on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has been postponed. Photograph:  Reuters Theresa May is to postpone Tuesday’s House of Commons vote on her Brexit deal, according to several reports.Such a development will be seen as a clear admission by the UK prime minister that she does not believe she can get a majority of MPs to back the unpopular withdrawal agreement.The House of Commons speaker’s office confirmed Mrs May would give an oral statement to the house on the European Union at 3.30pm today.Sterling tumbled to its lowest level in 18 months on the back of the news.There are reports in the UK that Mrs May will indicate that she wishes to renegotiate aspects of the backstop agreement, an insurance policy included in the deal to avoid a hard Irish border in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. If the vote is deferred, it could take place next week or even be delayed until early January. However, this would allow less time for the ensuing Brexit legislation to be passed through parliament before March 29th. The ultimate deadline for the vote is January 21st. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he had not been made aware of any plans by Mrs May to delay the vote. “What I can say is the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, is the only agreement on the table,” he told reporters in Dublin. He said Ireland would be open to statements of clarification but that the substance of the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, could not be changed. A European commission spokesman said: “This deal is the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate the deal that is on the table right now. That is very clear. “Our position has therefore not changed and as far as we’re concerned the UK is leaving the EU on the 29th March, 2019. We are prepared for all scenarios.”Mr Varadkar and Mrs May spoke by telephone on Sunday but he did not ulge the specifics of their conversation. “The purpose of the phone call was to update me on the progress she is making in trying to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons and then also to think ahead as to how we’d handle the EU summit which is happening later in the week.”The Taoiseach also said that the EU had already offered Britain a number of concessions, and that the shape the Brexit deal was due to the red lines laid down by Mrs May.“The United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union and the UK government decided to take lots of options off the table, whether it was staying in the single market or the customs union or a Northern Ireland specific backstop, so the reason we ended up with the solution that we have is because of the red lines the United Kingdom itself laid down,” he said.“A lot of concessions have been made along the way, most recently for example, we agreed there would be a review clause. I don’t think we should ever forget how we got to this point. The European Union’s top court ruled on Monday that the UK could unilaterally revoke Article 50, the notice given of its intention to leave the EU. The postponement of the vote would be a significant blow to Mrs May’s authority, although it would theoretically give her extra time to negotiate with the EUand to win over Tory MPs who are hostile to it.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: “The government has decided Theresa May’s Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour”. The DUP described the expected delay over the meaningful vote as “a bit of a humiliation” that Mrs May has “brought upon herself”.Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the party, which props up Mrs May’s minority government at Westminster, said the vote had been “pulled because it would have been overwhelmingly defeated”. “Deferring the vote is only of any use if the government is prepared to go to Brussels and insist on necessary changes to the Withdrawal Agreement,” he said. Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “Assuming these reports are accurate, this is a watershed moment and an act of pathetic cowardice by a Tory government which has run out of road and is now collapsing into utter chaos.” Earlier on Monday, the British environment secretary Michael Gove categorically stated the vote would go ahead. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if the vote was “definitely, 100 per cent” going to happen, the environment secretary replied: “Yes”. Mrs May conducted a frantic round of telephone diplomacy over the weekend, speaking to German chancellor Angela Merkel and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, Number 10 confirmed. She had also spoken to Donald Tusk, the president of the EU council. Insiders said she had spoken to cabinet members to update them on the outcome of the calls, amid intense pressure from hard Brexit Conservative backbenchers to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement to remove the unpopular Northern Ireland backstop. –  Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty ImagesEvidence of rodents gnawing at bread packaging was uncovered at a Tesco store in Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim when food safety inspectors went to the premises after receiving a consumer complaint. Tesco Ireland Ltd was among 13 food businesses served with closure orders last month for breaching food safety legislation, according to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Inspectors said there was evidence of a “significant” rodent infection at the premises, which posed a “serious risk to public health”, in a report of their visit on November 6th. A closure order was also served by HSE environmental health inspectors on O’Brien’s Gala shop at Tulla Road in Ennis, Co Clare after inspectors found evidence of “a significant number of rodent droppings and gnawed foodstuffs and packaging” at the shop, indicating a “serious rodent infection”.Everest Express Fish \u0026amp Chips Takeaway on Tulla Road, Ennis, was also served with a closure order due to a serious rodent infection. The New World Thai and Chinese Takeaway at 275 Glasnevin Avenue, Glasnevin was also served with a closure order after inspectors found chopping boards in the kitchen “filthy with ingrained dirt” and “defective, worn and filthy” cleaning equipment in the kitchen. In Co Kilkenny, the Blue Door restaurant at 59 John Street was served with a closure order when inspectors found the internal and external surfaces of refrigerators and freezers showing evidence of rust, mould and dirt. Food on the premises was stored in “broken containers and cardboard boxes which were covered in grease and dirt”, the inspection report said. There was also a build-up of ingrained dirt and food debris on surfaces including floors, walls, ceilings, doors, equipment and other hand-contact surfaces. Enforcement orders were also issued last month after inspectors witnessed “a number of cockroaches” crawling in food preparation and food storage areas. In one premises, they found boards in a kitchen with “multiple dead and live cockroaches” on them.Orders were also issued for a failure to segregate raw and ready-to-eat and cooked foods during storage and for not declaring nut allergens on a menu. FSAI chief executive Dr Pamela Byrne said food businesses must operate strict food safety procedures at all times and that they needed to be extra vigilant during this busy time of year. “Fourteen enforcement orders in one month is an unacceptable number. The reasons for the enforcement orders having to be served are all easily preventable in the first place and food businesses should not allow their standards to slip,” Dr Byrne said. “All food businesses must ensure that they adhere to a high standard of food safety and hygiene at all times. It is also imperative that a proper pest control system is in place and that this is checked very regularly in order to avoid infestations of rodents and insects.”One prosecution was taken by the HSE in November in relation to Cissie’s Farm Shop, Ardnawark, Barnesmore, Donegal town.Further information on food safety and on the enforcement orders is available on the FSAI’s website at fsai.ie.The full list of enforcement orders served in November is as follows:Eight closure orders were served under the FSAI Act 1998 on:Five closure orders were served under the EC (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2010 on: • Galmere Fresh Foods Limited (Closed activity: Manufacturing of ready to eat products containing fresh basil, not subject to heat treatment, as an ingredient), Ballybrit Upper Industrial Estate, Monivea Road, Co Galway• Colours of India (restaurant), Unit 2 Hibernian Way, Mallow, Co Cork• New World Thai and Chinese Take Away, 275 Glasnevin Avenue, Glasnevin, Dublin 11One prohibition order was served under the EC (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2010 on:"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3725240.1544383772!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"some unionists are thinking the unthinkable about living in a united ireland","story":"Democtartic Union Party leader Arlene Foster has said on 8th December, that there is more work do do on Irish border before final Brexit deal is agreed.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe atmosphere in Westminster fuels the DUP sense of paranoia and its conviction that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from the rest of the UK.Northern Ireland is changing, and quickly. Despite the presence of several seats of learning here I continue to be surprised at the absence of any serious scholarship tracking the step changes happening before our eyes.Recently, I listened to former Democratic Unionist Party first minister Peter Robinson when he gave a speech to the Knock Methodist Centre in East Belfast. Later, some of those in the audience told me they are now learning Irish.Let us not exaggerate the numbers of those in the Protestant community who are doing so, but their actions are in contrast to the crass denigration of the language by some in the DUP, such as party leader Arlene Foster or Gregory Campbell.Once upon a time, Peter Robinson might have agreed, or did agree with such views. But he grew comfortable during his years in government dealing with “crocodiles” such as Martin McGuinness and fellow Sinn Féin Irish-speaking personnel, unlike his colleagues.Can you imagine Robinson’s thoughts on the Irish language as he watched his colleagues letting the issue of the treatment of it lead to the collapse last February of a deal that would have restored the Stormont institutions.Speaking at the Knock Methodist Centre, he said: “I couldn’t care less about the Irish Language. Let them speak it until they are green, white and orange in the face, as long as it doesn’t encroach on me. This was ‘such a small issue’ – smaller than, say, the devolution of policing and justice and, before that, agreeing the conditions for that Paisley-McGuinness Executive.”The DUP incontrovertibly reached a deal in February with Sinn Féin. Equally, it is incontrovertible that the DUP later resiled from that deal, leaving former ministers and its negotiators, Edwin Poots and Simon Hamilton, exposed and potentially damaged.The bona fides of the secret agreement, which Brian Rowan I reported on in Eamonn Mallie. com in the days after the collapse of the talks, were contemptuously challenged by Jeffrey Donaldson, Foster and Campbell.However, it is time to nail the big lie peddled by the DUP that Sinn Féin was responsible for collapsing the February 9th negotiations because of what the DUP call Sinn Féin’s “red lines” on the Irish language.Instead, the DUP negotiating team had bought into an agreement that embraced the Irish language. Initially, it had Foster’s blessing. Indeed, top Irish and British officials returned home that Friday evening confident the deal was in the bag.The DUP grassroots rose up over the weekend when news broke that British prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were due at Stormont on Monday, February 12th, to give the emerging agreement their imprimatur.During that weekend, Foster was overwhelmed by forces in her own party, including one DUP MP who told me that he took “one look” at the document after he returned from London and told the negotiators “it won’t fly with the grassroots”. The MP said it was impossible for the party to sell a package that better acknowledged the place of the Irish language given that the DUP leadership had run a campaign of abuse against it for nearly two years.The leadership panicked and the rest is history. Merrion Street in Dublin and Downing Street were left speechless on Wednesday, February 14th, after Foster tweeted: “In our view there is no current prospect of the discussions leading to an Executive being formed.”During his speech to the Knock Methodist Centre, Robinson drove a horse and coaches through the DUP leadership’s contestable history of what had happened during those days in February.“I wish the draft agreement that unravelled in February had been leaked earlier,” he said. Robinson argued that many of the fears wrongly raised in advance about quotas in the Civil Service having to speak Irish and Irish language street signs everywhere, proved groundless.The damage done then to the working relationship in February between the DUP and Sinn Féin may prove to be irreparable, certainly in the short to long term. Indeed, it could be argued that Sinn Féin has every reason to sit and wait.The United Kingdom’s impending Brexit from the European Union and the bitterly-contested withdrawal agreement May concluded with the EU27 in Brussels, should it stick, might discourage Sinn Féin from returning to Stormont.Republicans could interpret that the agreement’s terms are a tinkering with, or fracturing of, the place of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that this is something positive and not to be discouraged.This point has to be tempered, however, by an acceptance that the deal agreed by May is surprisingly favourable to Northern Ireland, when viewed solely through economic eyes. Such a deal was considered illusory by nationalists at the outset.The confidence and supply agreement between the Conservatives and the DUP keeping May in power blindsided nationalists to any potential good flowing from Brexit. The EU May withdrawal deal came from left field.Nationalists had been feeling abandoned by Downing Street, left to the mercy of a daily London-centric, patronising DUP cacophony coming at them in waves, where Nigel Dodds and his fellow DUP MPS strutted the Westminster stage.In the eyes of nationalists the DUP have wrongly assumed it has authority to speak on behalf of all in Northern Ireland, despite the fact the majority voted to stay in the EU.The May-EU deal has been begrudgingly welcomed by Sinn Féin because it would guard against a hard border. But the reality is that if it holds, a big if, admittedly, then Brexit will do more to redefine Northern Ireland’s status than occurred during 30 years of IRA violence.Sinn Féin will likely hold back from signing up to any Stormont arrangement with the DUP. They know that the sword of Damocles hangs above that party until the cash-for-ash ( Renewable Heat Incentive) scandal inquiry reports in the new year.Sinn Féin is wary about Foster’s ability to deliver a deal. And they would need to be certain that she can deliver in any fresh negotiations. Republicans are mindful too of another shift occurring – there is a sea-change in attitudes of middle-class nationalists.This is not an accident. Doctors, dentists, solicitors, people in business and in many walks of life, from a Catholic nationalist background, ashamed of the IRA’s campaign of violence, much of it visited upon their Protestant neighbours in salubrious residential areas, and in the workplace, kept their heads down during the Troubles and got on with their lives.However, that has changed – to invoke the immortal words of WB Yeats on the back of two words, “crocodile” and “Brexit”. “All changed uttlerly changed.” Middle-class nationalism is no longer sitting on the fence.They like what they know, see and hear in Dublin under the leadership of Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. They are proud of the Republic as a 21st century State, where its leaders sit comfortably at the Brussels table unencumbered by the historical labels of religious and social conservatism.This fact has not escaped Robinson’s attention either who remarked, while addressing the Methodists in east Belfast, “you can’t speak now of Home Rule being Rome Rule” south of the Border.The hurt – and there is no other word – visited upon nationalism in 2017 by Foster when she said, “if you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back and looking for more” was incalculable.Though the DUP leader was directing her remarks at Sinn Féin’s demand for an Irish Language Act, the injury was felt by all nationalists not just those interested in the language. Reading between the lines, they judged that parity of esteem was not on offer in what Foster calls “my precious union”.That one word did more damage to any nationalist sense of belonging to the patch of land they inhabit than anything ever uttered by former Northern Ireland PM Basil Brookeborough who in 1933 said: “Many in this audience employ Catholics, but I have not one about my place. Catholics are out to destroy Ulster. ”One wonders whether Robinson’s intervention creates a more conducive environment, providing wriggle room for Foster when “parity of esteem” for nationalists next comes back on the table.Unionism believes the sparkle from that sonorous jewel – our precious union – is in danger of losing much of its radiance as a result of the May withdrawal agreement. This is debatable since Northern Ireland’s constitutional position is guaranteed under the terms of the Belfast Agreement.The DUP is clutching desperately at their sense of Britishness. And they genuinely feel the May package poses a threat to their identity politically, constitutionally and culturally. In essence what unionism is desperate to protect is its “parity of esteem” as citizens of the UK.The deficit in the unionist psyche is that it has continuously refused to acknowledge that nationalists also feel they have an entitlement to parity of esteem. This denial to nationalism by unionism is responsible for the absence of a government in Northern Ireland.The DUP’s time in the sun was short lived. Their 10 Westminster MPs proved incapable of keeping a check on their exuberance and sense of self-importance flowing from their agreement with the Conservative party.Soon, allegations of “betrayal” and “vassal state” emerged from the DUP as it warned its deal is with the Conservatives, not with May. It will be interesting to see how long that crutch will bear the political strain.The atmosphere in Westminster fuels the DUP sense of paranoia and its conviction that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from the rest of the UK. It leaves them at risk, too, of ridicule for placing their trust in Conservatives.History students will recall former British prime minister Ted Heath’s proroguing of the Stormont government in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher’s 1981 secret contacts with IRA hunger strikers, the 1985 signing of the Anglo Irish Agreement over the heads of unionism and former British PM John Major’s secret back channel to Sinn Féin in the early 1990s. The withdrawal agreement is but the latest act in the Conservative-unionist drama.In truth, the DUP is a party that staggers from crisis to crisis and from scandal to scandal.What leader of a large political party wants to have to stand up at its annual conference and wear sackcloth and ashes as Foster did last month in her address over the cash-for-ash scandal.I have observed enough down the years to know that at moments like these where there is talk of any threat to Northern Ireland’s constitutional status this can be accompanied by “rustling in the undergrowth” by loyalists.While the opposition role being played by the DUP to the so called back-stop agreed by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border may serve as a safety valve, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, I suspect will be keeping an ear to the ground.Remarkably the DUP finds itself for the first time at loggerheads with the Ulster Farmers Union (UFU), the Confederation of Business Industry, the NI Retail Consortium, the Chamber of Commerce and several food and drink umbrella groups which are all taking a contrary position on the May withdrawal deal to the DUP. Some of these groups went over the heads of the DUP MPs to meet May in Downing Street.In turn, DUP MP Sammy Wilson accused businesses backing the deal of being “the puppets of the Northern Ireland Office”, while the usually unflappable DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson lost his temper when speaking on The View BBC One Northern Ireland.There, he said, “the UFU and business leaders – they are wrong. I don’t believe they have read the detail of this, they have not read the 500 pages. There are serious constitutional and economic implications of this deal for Northern Ireland.”Such words did not go down well, particularly after Foster indulged in Trumpian politics by claiming that the media is trying to drive a wedge between her party and Northern Ireland’s business community.That opposition to the DUP’s stance has not diminished.For the first time there are signs of fissuring in middle-class unionism. The retired surgeon Terry Irwin who calls himself an Irish unionist tweeted recently: “The DUP have convinced many ‘soft’ unionists like myself to seriously consider whether we would be better in a United Ireland.”Prof Jim Dornan, an obstetrician-gynaecologist, is now entertaining the idea of a new Ireland. He said: “I would traditionally be thought of as being quite happy with the union and I have been. It has been very good to me, educationally and health wise and everything else in my life.”On whether he thought a Border poll would mean a victory for Irish unity, he said: “Against the union as we have at the moment, there is a lot of people nowadays, not just me, who are saying ‘you know what, if somebody offers me a better deal and somebody offers me a good deal, then I would go for it’.” He added, “everything is on the table” after the Brexit vote.I underscored earlier the sea-change in middle-class nationalist opinion. The fluidity of thinking in middle-class unionism – people of business and professional backgrounds cannot be ignored. Around dinner tables some traditional unionists are now openly questioning where they want to be politically – some thinking the unthinkable – living in a new Ireland.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersAny British obstruction of Irish hauliers travelling to and from Europe through the UK could lead to retaliatory restrictions on British traffic in Europe, transport and export industry sources have warned.Concerns about risks to disruptions to the vital route for haulage companies have emerged in light of calls by Conservative former minister Priti Patel to use the “land bridge” as leverage to seek concessions on the Brexit deal.The former international development minister was condemned in Ireland and UK for saying Britain could prevent the use of the country as a bridge between Ireland and European in a no-deal scenario in order to press the Irish Government to drop the contentious backstop.She later backtracked on her comments, saying that they were “taken out of context”.The UK is party to an international agreement on transport through countries known as Common Transit convention, signed in 1987, which guarantees the unhindered transit of goods.The agreement extends beyond European Union member states to countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, Macedonia and Serbia. Any deliberate delays imposed on goods passing through the UK for products originating from or destined for any of these countries and Ireland would amount to a breach of this convention.“If you stopped vehicles travelling through the land bridge, basically you are tearing up the convention, which would harm British hauliers who rely on that going to the Continent after Brexit,” said Seamus Leheny, policy manager with the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Two-thirds of Irish exporters make use of the UK land bridge, connecting Ireland and Europe through British ports such as Holyhead and Dover, according to the Irish Exporters Association. Some 53 per cent of Irish exports with the rest of the world (excluding the UK) in volume terms pass through the UK.“Would the EU take a dim view of Britain taking unilateral action in relation to the land bridge? Would they retaliate? Maybe they could. It could mean that there is a slowdown of British freight getting on and off the island,” said Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association.A bigger concern for importers and exporters, and transport companies shipping goods, is the delays arising from customs checks at points of entry into the UK should Theresa May’s Brexit deal be voted down in the House of Commons.Verona Murphy, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, said she did not believe the UK would threaten to block off access for transiting goods but delays could make it seem that way.“If there were to be a no-deal Brexit, the disruption it will cause may well look like the land bridge has been stopped there will be so much traffic backed up at the ports,” she said.Irish business groups are expected to heap significant pressure on Government this week to disclose further details of the no-deal contingency planning being developed privately should the EU-UK orce deal be voted down by the UK parliament, as is widely expected given the level of opposition to the proposed agreement.Government sources fear that any no-deal contingency plans released in Dublin could be used for political advantage by the rival Leave and Remain factions in London to press for further demands from Brussels.The Department of the Taoiseach hosted a meeting of senior civil servants from various Government departments last Friday in what was the latest in a series of planning meetings around no-deal contingency work.Companies in the pharmaceutical and food and drinks industry were planning to begin stockpiling products should Mrs May’s deal be voted down, said Mr McKeever.“We are getting increasingly concerned about a no-deal situation and what happens then,” he said.On Friday, Ireland’s EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan, said the Government and State agencies “have to be planning ahead more intensively” for a potential no-deal scenario.He cited the risks to the land bridge specifically and said major energy and other infrastructure projects may need to be brought forward.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Middle East Monitor via Reuters Journalist Jamal Khashoggi repeatedly told his killers “I can’t breathe” during his final moments in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, CNN reported on Monday.Quoting a source who said they had read the full translated transcript of an audio recording, CNN said that Khashoggi recognised one of the men, Gen Maher Mutreb, who told him: “You are coming back”.Khashoggi replied: “You can’t do that ... people are waiting outside.”His Turkish fiancee Hatice Cengiz waited for hours outside the consulate on October 2nd and, when he did not return, contacted Turkish authorities about his disappearance.There was no further dialogue in the relatively short transcript, prepared by Turkish authorities, CNN’s source said.As people set upon Khashoggi, he started fighting for air, repeating, “I can’t breathe” at least three times. The transcript then used singular words to describe the noises, including “scream”, “gasping”, “saw”, and “cutting”.Turkish sources told Reuters a bone saw was used to dismember the journalist.The transcript included no further mention of returning Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, and no indication that he had been drugged – as Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said in November.One of the voices was identified in the transcript by Turkish authorities as Dr Salah al-Tubaigy, a forensic expert who specialises in post mortem examinationand is attached to the Saudi ministry of interior, CNN reported.Tubaigy tells others to put in earphones or listen to music, as he is doing, the CNN source said.Mutreb, a senior intelligence officer who is part of the security team of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, called officials and gave step-by-step details of the operation, CNN reported, finally saying: “Tell yours, the thing is done, it’s done.”Turkish officials said last week that the Istanbul prosecutor’s office had concluded there was “strong suspicion” that Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Prince Mohammed, and Gen Ahmed al-Asiri, who served as deputy head of foreign intelligence, were among the planners of Khashoggi’s killing.Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.The kingdom has come under scrutiny as details of his killing came to light. Making some of their strongest accusations so far, both US Republicans and Democrats said last week they wanted to pass legislation to send a message to Saudi Arabia that the United States condemned the death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist.A Turkish official said that by extraditing all suspects to Turkey, the Saudi authorities could address the international community’s concerns.Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, on Sunday ruled out their extradition. “We don’t extradite our citizens,” he said at a Gulf Arab summit in Riyadh.Last month, Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor’s office said it was seeking the death penalty for five iniduals, and that 11 of 21 suspects had been indicted and would be referred to court in Saudi Arabia. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3723653.1544203490!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eight things that might happen after tuesday s commons vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British prime minister Theresa May speaks at a press conference  in Brussels last month. Photograph: Sean GallupGetty ImagesOn Tuesday the British parliament is due to vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement brokered with the European Union by prime minister Theresa May. Mrs May faces a mammoth task to win the vote, with opposition to the deal from all sides of the floor in the House of Commons. If she does indeed lose the vote, the outlook for the future of Britain\u0027s exit from the EU is uncertain to say the least. Here are a number of scenarios that may come into play after the vote.When Theresa May’s cabinet meets around the coffin-shaped table in Downing Street on Tuesday morning, chief whip Julian Smith will report on the likely outcome of that evening’s vote on the Brexit deal. Unless his success rate at persuading Brexiteer MPs to support the deal improves dramatically over the weekend, Smith will predict a crushing defeat for the prime minister.Already, a number of ministers are urging May to call off Tuesday evening’s vote, a view shared by Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee of backbenchers.“I think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstop, Northern Ireland protocol situation if we were to enter into one in the future. It’s having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing,” he said.“So if that question can be answered in the course of the next few days, then all well and good. If it can’t then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred until such time as we can answer that question.”\u0026nbspHowever, as of Monday morning senior Conservative figures, including environment secretary Michael Gove, were continuing to insist the vote would go ahead as planned.\u0026nbspPostponing the vote, which is scheduled for 7pm on Tuesday, is not straightforward and could itself require a vote for the House to adjourn. There is no reason to believe that the DUP, who wants May out of Downing Street, would make life easier for her by sparing her the humiliation of a defeat on her deal.Procedural ruses to avoid a vote, such as failing to move the motion at the start of the debate on Tuesday or simply talking past 7pm, would be almost as humiliating as a defeat on the Brexit deal. But not quite.Viewed in Westminster as all but impossible, a victory for May on Tuesday night would mean that Britain will probably leave the European Union on March 29th next year on the terms outlined in her deal.Without the support of the DUP, who will not support the deal, the prime minister could win only with the support of some Labour rebels. She would need to retain their support to approve enabling legislation for the deal next year.The DUP has said it would support the government in a confidence vote if the deal is rejected but if it passes, the confidence and supply agreement would be over. One senior DUP figure told me this week that Jeremy Corbyn’s history of support for Irish republicanism would not necessarily prevent the party from toppling a Conservative government.“It wasn’t a Labour secretary of state who said that Britain had no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland. And it wasn’t a Labour government that signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement that started all this,” he said.For a government to lose a vote by any margin on the most important piece of legislation in decades would in normal circumstances be calamitous. But expectations ahead of Tuesday’s vote are so dismal that if May loses by fewer than 50 votes, Downing Street will feel able to claim victory.To reverse such a loss, May would have to change the minds of perhaps a couple of dozen MPs, probably after securing some changes to the political declaration accompanying the withdrawal agreement. EU leaders are unlikely to offer any concrete concessions when they meet in Brussels next Thursday, not least because they fear that any changes offered so soon would lose their lustre over the Christmas break.In January, the EU could offer some cosmetic assurances about the backstop, perhaps in the form of an exchange of letters or an interpretive declaration. These would seek to reassure MPs that both sides would seek to avoid invoking the backstop and make every effort to ensure that it does not last for long.More than 100 MPs have already indicated that they will vote against the deal and even if the whips reduce that number by half, May would still lose by more than 100 votes. Such a defeat would lead many prime ministers to step down but May has a dogged sense of duty and is not the resigning type.If she refuses to go voluntarily, she will probably face a confidence vote in her leadership which she is now likely either to lose or to win by such a narrow margin that her position would be almost untenable.If she goes, a Conservative leadership election would see candidates from the cabinet, led by home secretary Sajid Javid and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, compete against a hard Brexiteer backed by the European Research Group, probably Boris Johnson or former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab.An expedited process could see MPs choosing two candidates to go before the party membership before Christmas, with a new leader in place in the first half of January. Any new leader would have to pursue a different Brexit strategy or seek substantive changes to the current deal.EU leaders, the Commission, European Council president Donald Tusk and chief negotiator Michel Barnier all insist that the text of the withdrawal agreement is now closed and cannot be renegotiated. But faced with a new British prime minister and the approaching threat of a no-deal Brexit, they could relent.One option would be to remove the UK-wide customs element of the backstop, so that the EU-UK customs relationship would be negotiated as part of the future trade arrangement. Instead of a time limit for the transition period, the two sides could renew it every year until a trade deal was agreed.This would remove the threat of Britain being trapped in the backstop once the transition period expired but it would leave the Northern Ireland-only backstop intact. This would make starker the regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and create a customs border in the Irish Sea.A more radical change would see the EU accede to British Eurosceptic demands for a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop. Such a change would secure the support even of the DUP because as one of the party’s MPs put it, “it would kill the backstop”.There have been only two small blips in the history of EU solidarity with Ireland over the backstop. Last summer, a Polish minister suggested the issue should be dealt with as part of the future relationship rather than included in the withdrawal agreement.And during last October’s summit, German chancellor Angela Merkel mused that if the deadlock over the backstop led to a no-deal Brexit, Ireland could see the creation of the hard border the backstop was designed to prevent.The Polish minister was slapped down and his government fell into line behind the backstop. Downing Street became greatly excited by Merkel’s remarks but according to those present, she was teasing out the issue intellectually rather than signalling that she wanted a change of course.Killing the backstop by means of a unilateral exit mechanism remains an unlikely option, not least because it would represent the betrayal of the interests of a remaining EU member-state for the sake of a state that is leaving the union.An amendment approved by MPs this week means that, if the Brexit deal is defeated next week, any new motion the government brings forward about Brexit in the coming weeks can be subject to amendments.This will allow MPs to direct the government on what to do next, including a rejection of a no-deal Brexit or an instruction to pursue a certain kind of deal. Although such an instruction is not legally binding, it would be hard for any government to ignore.Among the Conservative MPs who backed the amendment are some who support what they call Norway-plus – membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and the EU customs union. The proposal also enjoys the support of many Labour MPs and has the quiet backing of some cabinet ministers.Under the plan, Britain would accept May’s withdrawal agreement but would modify the political declaration to set Norway-plus as the destination. Norway follows all EU single market regulations and accepts the free movement of people, although the EEA allows for a brake on free movement in certain circumstances.The plan has a number of difficulties, including the fact that Britain would still have to sign up to a Northern Ireland backstop to ensure that the Border would remain open should London choose to leave the EEA.Current Efta members are not wholeheartedly enthusiastic about Britain joining, partly because it is so much bigger than the others but also because some British politicians have made clear that they view the arrangement as a temporary one. The EU would impose stricter conditions on Britain than on Norway and would seek to ensure that the arrangement is durable and predictable.Support for Norway-plus at Westminster has fallen in recent weeks as pro-EU MPs believe the prospect of remaining in the EU altogether has become more likely.“That ship has sailed,” one former supporter of the plan said. “It’s all about the people’s vote now.”If May’s deal is rejected, the EU refuses to renegotiate it, and Norway-plus cannot win majority support, MPs will face a choice between leaving the EU without a deal and calling a second referendum. There is a clear majority in the House of Commons against a no-deal Brexit so a second referendum is more likely than ever before.Labour has said that, if May’s deal is defeated, it will seek a general election and if that fails, it will consider all options including “a public vote”. The DUP has made clear that it will support the government in a confidence vote if the deal is rejected, so Labour will not get its general election.The party is then likely to move swiftly behind the call for a second referendum, which is already backed by the other opposition parties and by a number of Conservative MPs. Some Brexiteers relish the prospect of a second vote, which they are confident will produce a resounding endorsement of Brexit.If May survives, calling a second referendum could be her best strategy for keeping her party together and keeping her Brexit deal alive. MPs would have to agree on the question to be put on the ballot paper: Leave or Remain? May’s deal or Remain? May’s deal or a no-deal Brexit? Or all three options in a referendum.A second referendum would take at least 12 weeks to set up and could require a short extension of the article 50 negotiating process, which the EU is likely to grant. Polls this week suggest that, if May’s deal is on the ballot, it would win.According to article 50, Britain will leave the EU on at 11pm on March 29th, 2019 and unless something intervenes it will do just that, deal or no deal. Although a majority in the House of Commons is opposed to leaving without a deal, MPs have not yet been able to form a majority behind any of the alternatives.This week’s amendment giving MPs a stronger voice in the direction of Brexit has made no deal less likely but it remains a real possibility if MPs fail to fall in behind May’s deal, Norway-plus or a second referendum. The EU says it will agree skeleton arrangements with Britain to ensure for example that planes can take off and land and that energy supplies will not be interrupted.But the short-term impact of a no-deal Brexit will be disruptive and costly, as much to Ireland as to Britain, with a likely plunge in sterling and delays to Irish exports into Britain and the rest of Europe.If these are anxious days in Westminster, there must be sleepless nights in Dublin too.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Andy RainEPATheresa May is under growing pressure to postpone Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal and to attempt to persuade the European Union to renegotiate it. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said on Sunday that the vote would go ahead as planned, despite the fact that dozens of Conservative MPs have said they will vote against the prime minister’s deal. “The vote is going ahead and that’s because it’s a good deal and it’s the only deal,” Mr Barclay told the BBC. Some Conservatives fear that pressing ahead with the vote will lead to a crushing defeat for Mrs May which could doom her Brexit deal and her premiership. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the prime minister should insist that Britain be able to unilaterally end the Northern Ireland backstop. “Is it possible for us to reword this Northern Ireland Protocol, the 174-pages, so as it give the UK a unilateral exit mechanism? Yes, it is. And indeed the UK drafted such proposals but then failed to table them. That is the way to go,” he said. Mr Johnson refused to promise that he would not seek to replace Mrs May as prime minister, joining two other former ministers, Esther McVey and Dominic Raab, who declined to rule out a bid for the Conservative leadership. Mr Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary last month, claimed that the European Commission’s secretary general Martin Selmayr wanted to make Northern Ireland the price for Britain leaving the EU. “You would hear swirling around in Brussels, particularly people around Selmayr . . . that losing Northern Ireland would be the price the UK would pay for Brexit. This was reported to me through the diplomatic channels,” he told Sky News. Mr Raab said that leaving the EU without a deal was better than accepting Mrs May’s Brexit deal but he said she could stay on as prime minister even if she loses Tuesday’s vote. He said she could return to Brussels and tell the other 27 EU member states she wanted to renegotiate the deal. “If parliament has voted the deal down I think she can go and say this deal doesn’t work for the United Kingdom, ” he said. Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, who wants a second referendum on Brexit, warned on Sunday his party could split over the issue and find itself unable to continue in its current form. “I can see that this is of such a fundamental character, this issue, that it may be the end of the Conservative Party in its current form, and that bothers me very much because one of the products of Brexit has been total paralysis on virtually every other area of policy,” he said. In central London on Sunday, anti-fascist demonstrators massively outnumbered those at a “Brexit betrayal” march led by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right figure who styles himself Tommy Robinson. Elsewhere in London, the former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine told supporters of a second referendum that opposing Brexit was an act of patriotism: “Let us make our position clear. We are the British patriots. We want a Britain at the heart of Europe because we want the voice of Britain, the tolerance of Britain, the culture of Britain, at the heart of Europe. We are proud of our Commonwealth and empire. Our voice is their voice in Europe. It is the Brexiteers who seek to belittle us, to undermine our influence, to slam windows, to close doors with the suggestion that our membership of the European community blunts our influence.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Quick Reaction Alert jets based at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland are regularly  scrambled to deter Russian aircraft approaching UK airspace over the North Sea.The exact nature of last week\u0027s incident remained classified.The introduction of Meteor represents the culmination of many years of research, development and testing to bring the advanced weapon into service on front-line aircraft.The Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “This latest missile system demonstrates the next chapter of the Typhoon which will see the jet evolve its ability to target and destroy any airborne threat at great distances.“The Meteor missile will provide an unrelenting deterrence to those who wish harm upon the UK and our Armed Forces.“The RAF’s prized Typhoon Force is unquestionably now the cornerstone of British and Nato military power. It has proved itself in combat roles over Libya, Iraq and Syria, protecting UK skies and overseas territories, and providing critical support to our NATO Allies in Eastern Europe.”Meteor can fly in any weather condition at over four times the speed of sound. It has been designed to defeat all current and known future threats, including combat aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles or missiles. The range of the weapon is classified, but it will eventually operate from the F-35 Lightning stealth jet.The missile - weighing 185kgs and measuring 3.7m long - uses an air-breathing ramjet to boost the weapon away from the launch aircraft. It then remains under power until warhead detonation, giving the missile the energy to pursue and destroy the fastest and most agile aircraft.The warhead carries impact and proximity fuses so targets can be destroyed even if the missile does not score a direct hit.The pilot flying the first Meteor equipped Typhoon said: “The responsibility of flying such a capable platform, armed with this formidable weapon is immense, but the options this gives us in responding to an emergency situation cannot be understated.”Meteor has been developed by a six-nation European partnership led by the UK. It is built and manufactured by MBDA in Stevenage and has created 430 jobs across the country. The Meteor programme partners include the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news:  Theresa May postpones meaningful vote and tells ministers she will seek \u0026#39legally-binding assurance\u0026#39 that backstop won\u0026#39t be indefiniteComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s panicky Brexit vote delay makes it harder for anyone to trust her Russell Bishop guilty of Babes in the Wood murders after 32-year hunt for justice\u0026#39She is going to kill the Conservative party\u0026#39 -  readers react to Brexit vote delay  Alarm over plans to store samples of deadly diseases in Tokyo What does the ECJ ruling on Article 50 mean for the Brexit deal?As the Brexit \u0026#39meaningful vote\u0026#39 in Parliament is delayed - what are the next steps for Theresa May?Who could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

Sterling fell 0.91 per cent against the euro, to €1.1083, and dropped 0.51 per cent against the greenback to hit $1.2661.Simon Harvey, FX analyst at Monex Europe, said: “When the market thought uncertainty had finally peaked, May’s delay proves it wrong.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHe added: “Previously, the diminishing chances of a no-deal Brexit failed to prompt a rally in the pound, as did the increasing chances of the Brexit timeline being reset or scrapped. This reinforced the assumption that the path of least resistance for sterling was always down to the high likelihood of a deal being rejected. “However, by delaying the vote, May has all but accepted a defeat was the likely outcome and this increases uncertainty in the market. Today’s developments ultimately proved enough to push the pound to its lowest level in the last 18-months as it repriced the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.The EU has already stated that the deal will not be renegotiated, leaving May between a rock and a hard Brexit.”David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB Online Trading, said delaying the vote “may have spared an embarrassing parliamentary defeat for the PM but it will no doubt see those calls for her to be replaced grow ever more vociferous”.“The negative reaction in the markets is more likely due to what it means for her position rather than the failure to win the vote - with even her staunchest supporters already highly skeptical as to whether the bill would pass - as it now seems increasingly likely that a long-touted leadership challenge will ensue,” he added.“May is now expected to make a late dash to Brussels in a frantic bid to renegotiate the deal but here position is no doubt becoming increasingly untenable. The frontrunners to replace May as PM such as Boris and Rees-Mogg are much more likely to push for a hard Brexit and this would no doubt be negative for the pound, at least in the near term.”Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, said: “It was anticipated that this week would be volatile for the pound and it certainly has kicked off in that way. Many predicted that tomorrow would be the big day for any movement in the pound.“However, it has already reached three-month lows against the euro and... could hit lows last seen against the dollar in August.”The pound was on shaky ground on Monday morning even before the vote was pulled.Today’s ECJ ruling makes a new referendum more likelyThe ECJ opinion makes it easier for MPs to vote for a new referendumUK can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50, ECJ rulesSimon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe, said the fact that the results of the vote, had it gone ahead, were so unclear meant the currency would remain unstable in the near future.“The only certainty this week is increased volatility in foreign exchange markets,” he addedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Averse to exercise. You see him on the Vitality posters on the Underground. It’s a clever advertising ploy because the point is to get you to do more exercise. And the surprising thing – if you look more closely – is it’s all about insurance.It used to be you bought life or health insurance, stuck the paperwork in a drawer, and then forgot about it, until you got ill or they called for the priest. That has all changed – as Herschel Mayers, CEO of Vitality, explained to me. Born in Zimbabwe, he was brought up in Johannesburg, and ides his time between South Africa and London. After a few years with Liberty, Mayers co-founded Discovery Life, now the largest insurer in South Africa. He joined forces with Prudential in 2014 to set up Vitality. Now 58, he trained as an actuary, so he’s good at mathematics and statistics and probabilities and improbabilities. But stick with me here, because he is also good at making it simple. Personal confession: many moons ago I turned down the opportunity to go about selling insurance because I thought of it as too doom-laden and didn’t want to scare the pants off people (“You know you’re going to die, don’t you? Stop kidding yourself, you’d better be prepared!”).The genius of Herschel Mayers lies in changing the narrative. He has spun insurance around 180 degrees and turned it away from being about dying or getting ill and made it all about keeping fit and well and living longer. He made me feel healthier just talking to him. A View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonHouzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techVitality has a so-called “wellness philosophy”, but this isn’t as hazy and airy-fairy as it sounds. You know all those good intentions you blithely announce around New Year and then it all goes to pot until the next round of solemn promises? Mr Mayers doesn’t want you to revert to couch potato. “Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you and exercise is good,” says Mayers. The interesting question he asks is, “How do you get people to change their behaviour for the better?” His answer is more carrot than stick – or, as it is now known, “behavioural economics”. This is how it works: you sign up to Vitality. Vitality straight off the bat gives you a 20 per cent discount, providing you agree to go to the gym regularly. And they give you juicy little incentives along the way if you stick by your commitment – free cinema tickets, coffee at Starbucks, an Amazon Prime subscription. The benevolent Mr Mayers is, in effect, paying you to keep hitting the cross-trainer or doing your 10,000 steps every day. The more steps, the less smoking, the better the incentive. Conversely, your discount is “eroded” over time if you slack and go back to your bad old ways. Can’t I just phone in or email to say how good I’ve been? Mayers has anticipated my would-be cunning deception. “That’s why we give you an ‘activity tracker’. We monitor your good behaviour.” So you actually have to clock in at the gym. They know if your heartbeat goes up or not. “It has to be verifiable,” says Mayers. So don’t think you can just sneak outside and have a quick fag. Such is the joy of social media. “We have daily interaction.”But, I can’t help wondering, isn’t that a bit tyrannical? \u0026nbsp“It would be, if we were forcing you,” says Mayers, reasonably enough. “But we’re not forcing you, it’s your choice to buy into the system in the first place. You don’t have to do it. But it makes more sense.” The logic of the deal is the “shared value model”, developed originally by Professor Michael E Porter at Harvard, a theory Mayers has translated into practice. The Vitality customer or “member” is given a subtle (or not so subtle) “nudge” in the direction of staying in better nick for longer. The value, or benefit, is shared by both the insured – who gets to enjoy life more, both quantitatively and qualitatively – and the insurer, who pays out less on claims. Everyone is a winner, including the nation as a whole, which gets one more useful and productive citizen to add to the GDP, and the NHS, which has one less chronically ill patient to look after for years on end. “By changing behaviour,” says Mayers, “we want to create additional economic value.” Call me a nanny-state guy if you will, but, realistically, when you’re up against the proliferation of cardiac-inducing fast food and fried chicken outlets, you need to do something to try and level the playing field. It’s not exactly King Canute trying to hold back the tide, it’s more Canute, or in this case Vitality, providing everyone (or at least the million or so members of the club) with surfboards to skim across the waves rather than just sit there on your backside getting swamped. “We are making a difference,” says Mayers. “People do go for check-ups and our claims are lower.” The Harvard-inspired theory is working so well that Mayers has now extended it into the realm of investing or saving. You know that other good intention you have, to put a bit aside from your wages for your retirement? And you know how it would be better to start sooner rather than later, ideally in your twenties? “Everyone knows this, but they don’t do it,” says Mayers. Well, guess who is going to give you a gentle nudge in that general direction? Vitality’s persuader in this case is a 20 per cent bonus at the end of it, when you collect your pension payout – providing you’ve behaved well and haven’t started too late or withdrawn it all too soon.

Sterling fell 0.91 per cent against the euro, to €1.1083, and dropped 0.51 per cent against the greenback to hit $1.2661.Simon Harvey, FX analyst at Monex Europe, said: “When the market thought uncertainty had finally peaked, May’s delay proves it wrong.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHe added: “Previously, the diminishing chances of a no-deal Brexit failed to prompt a rally in the pound, as did the increasing chances of the Brexit timeline being reset or scrapped. This reinforced the assumption that the path of least resistance for sterling was always down to the high likelihood of a deal being rejected. “However, by delaying the vote, May has all but accepted a defeat was the likely outcome and this increases uncertainty in the market. Today’s developments ultimately proved enough to push the pound to its lowest level in the last 18-months as it repriced the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.The EU has already stated that the deal will not be renegotiated, leaving May between a rock and a hard Brexit.”David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB Online Trading, said delaying the vote “may have spared an embarrassing parliamentary defeat for the PM but it will no doubt see those calls for her to be replaced grow ever more vociferous”.“The negative reaction in the markets is more likely due to what it means for her position rather than the failure to win the vote - with even her staunchest supporters already highly skeptical as to whether the bill would pass - as it now seems increasingly likely that a long-touted leadership challenge will ensue,” he added.“May is now expected to make a late dash to Brussels in a frantic bid to renegotiate the deal but here position is no doubt becoming increasingly untenable. The frontrunners to replace May as PM such as Boris and Rees-Mogg are much more likely to push for a hard Brexit and this would no doubt be negative for the pound, at least in the near term.”Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, said: “It was anticipated that this week would be volatile for the pound and it certainly has kicked off in that way. Many predicted that tomorrow would be the big day for any movement in the pound.“However, it has already reached three-month lows against the euro and... could hit lows last seen against the dollar in August.”The pound was on shaky ground on Monday morning even before the vote was pulled.Today’s ECJ ruling makes a new referendum more likelyThe ECJ opinion makes it easier for MPs to vote for a new referendumUK can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50, ECJ rulesSimon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe, said the fact that the results of the vote, had it gone ahead, were so unclear meant the currency would remain unstable in the near future.“The only certainty this week is increased volatility in foreign exchange markets,” he addedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It has also accredited\u0026nbspmore than 4,700 living wage employers but many large listed companies are not yet among them.Mara Lilley, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, said pressure from shareholders about low pay has already had an impact.When the group started engaging with FTSE 100 companies in 2010, only two were accredited by the Living Wage Foundation. That number now stands at 37.\u0026nbsp“Companies are clearly listening to their shareholders,” Ms Lilley said.“By engaging with companies on behalf of savers, these investors are showing that it’s entirely possible to focus on good returns as well as the interests of employees who may be struggling despite being in work.”\u0026nbspDiandra Soobiah, head of responsible investment at NEST, said there were “clear benefits” to companies paying the living wage, such as improved reputation, which can in turn boost profits.More than 6 million UK jobs ‘pay less than real living wage’Minimum wage failing to give families a basic \u0027no frills\u0027 lifestyle100,000 more women than men in Scotland paid less than the living wage“As a pension scheme with more than 7 million savers we need to achieve the best possible investment returns on their behalf.\u0026nbsp“That’s why we’re calling on the companies we invest in to do the right thing and sign up to the real Living Wage.”\u0026nbspMedian annual earnings are still £760 lower than they were a decade ago, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).People in their 20s and 30s have been hit hardest, with drops of 4.6 per cent and 7.6 per cent on the same age groups in 2008.While the UK’s official unemployment rate is at its lowest in more than four decades, many of the jobs created since the financial crisis have been low-paid and insecure.According to the Joseph Rowntree foundation, one of the key drivers of rising\u0026nbsppoverty\u0026nbsplevels has been parents getting stuck in low-paid work, particularly in hospitality and retail,Jackie Turpin, head of finance at Jospeph Rowntree Charitable Trust\u0026nbspsaid: “We firmly believe that a workforce that feels valued and respected will outperform one that doesn’t.\u0026nbsp“We welcome collaborative engagement to demonstrate that this belief is widely held and is rooted in many people’s experience.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Many firms cited Brexit uncertainty as a factor constraining investment and orders.“The marked weakening of the UK economy this autumn is as we expected given the continued high level of uncertainty around Brexit,” said John Hawksworth of PwC.“Until this is resolved, the UK economy is likely to remain in the doldrums as businesses will be reluctant to invest and households may also be reluctant to commit to big ticket items like house and car purchases.”Separately, the ONS also\u0026nbspreported on Monday that the UK’s goods trade balance in October widened to £11.87bn, higher than expected by City analysts.There was also a sharp downward revision to exports earlier in the year.This year’s trade boost has been suddenly revised away, reinstating this depreciation’s record as the least successful in Britain’s post-war history, said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.In the three months to October the deficit was £35.5bn. Good exports were up by 2.1 per cent over the three months, but this was outstripped by the increase in imports, which were 3 per cent higher.Including the services surplus, the total trade deficit was £3.3bn in October and £10.3bn over the quarter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair.

The best one appears to be topnine.co, which includes some extra features like the ability to see how many likes you managed to get over the entire year.That site seems to be having problem in some countries, such as the UK – perhaps because of more stringent privacy rules – and so if you can\u0027t use that one you could head to the 2018bestnine site.

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.Instagram finally lets people choose who sees storiesThe feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The number of children living in poverty rose more sharply last year than at any time in the last two decades,\u0026nbspthe Joseph Rowntree Foundation found.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSevern Trent, United Utilities and Vodafone are among companies that will be receiving\u0026nbspletters, while the construction industry is\u0026nbspunder particular scrutiny after research highlighted problems with low pay in the sector.\u0026nbspResponsible investment charity ShareAction, which is co-ordinating the move,\u0026nbspargues that paying a living wage reduces staff turnover and\u0026nbspmakes companies more successful in the long term.The national living wage, set by the government, is £7.83 and is set to increase to £8.21 in April, but the Living Wage Foundation says this is not enough for a full-time worker to be able to cover essential costs.\u0026nbspThe Living Wage could help the Government achieve its economic aimsThe foundation sets its own voluntary rate, which is regularly reviewed. It has also accredited\u0026nbspmore than 4,700 living wage employers but many large listed companies are not yet among them.Mara Lilley, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, said pressure from shareholders about low pay has already had an impact.When the group started engaging with FTSE 100 companies in 2010, only two were accredited by the Living Wage Foundation. That number now stands at 37.\u0026nbsp“Companies are clearly listening to their shareholders,” Ms Lilley said.“By engaging with companies on behalf of savers, these investors are showing that it’s entirely possible to focus on good returns as well as the interests of employees who may be struggling despite being in work.”\u0026nbspDiandra Soobiah, head of responsible investment at NEST, said there were “clear benefits” to companies paying the living wage, such as improved reputation, which can in turn boost profits.More than 6 million UK jobs ‘pay less than real living wage’Minimum wage failing to give families a basic \u0027no frills\u0027 lifestyle100,000 more women than men in Scotland paid less than the living wage“As a pension scheme with more than 7 million savers we need to achieve the best possible investment returns on their behalf.\u0026nbsp“That’s why we’re calling on the companies we invest in to do the right thing and sign up to the real Living Wage.”\u0026nbspMedian annual earnings are still £760 lower than they were a decade ago, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).People in their 20s and 30s have been hit hardest, with drops of 4.6 per cent and 7.6 per cent on the same age groups in 2008.While the UK’s official unemployment rate is at its lowest in more than four decades, many of the jobs created since the financial crisis have been low-paid and insecure.According to the Joseph Rowntree foundation, one of the key drivers of rising\u0026nbsppoverty\u0026nbsplevels has been parents getting stuck in low-paid work, particularly in hospitality and retail,Jackie Turpin, head of finance at Jospeph Rowntree Charitable Trust\u0026nbspsaid: “We firmly believe that a workforce that feels valued and respected will outperform one that doesn’t.\u0026nbsp“We welcome collaborative engagement to demonstrate that this belief is widely held and is rooted in many people’s experience.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Tatmadaw\u0027s tactics are consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats, especially in Rakhine State, but also in northern Myanmar, the report added, using the official name for the armed forces in Myanmar.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the Myanmar military\u0027s actions as abhorrent ethnic cleansing, adding that the US\u0026nbspwould continue to hold those responsible accountable.The US\u0026nbspalso imposed sanctions on three Myanmar military commanders for their roles in the ethnic cleansing.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boca Juniors\u0027 fan cheers at a viewing in Buenos Aires for the Copa Libertadores final against rivals River Plate.

Alongside the tweet, Cannon wrote\u0026nbsp“And I f**king love Wreck-It Ralph,” a reference to Silverman\u0027s role as the\u0026nbspvoice of Vanellope in the animation.Finally, Cannon resurfaced a 2012 tweet from Amy Schumer reading, “Enjoy skyfall f***.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. 140 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard.

PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through.

HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel.

Mission operators are still able to communicate with the spacecraft but it takes information – moving at the speed of light – a full 16.5 hours to make the long journey.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialNasa declared the spacecraft had left when the onboard\u0026nbspPlasma Science Experiment (PLS) showed that it was no longer detecting the plasma flowing out the sun. That outflow creates a bubble called the heliosphere, which envelopes the planets of the solar system and represents the edge of the solar system.JPL-Caltech)“Working on Voyager makes me feel like an explorer, because everything we’re seeing is new,” said John Richardson, principal investigator for the PLS instrument and a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.Sounds of Mars wind captured by Nasa\u0027s InSight lander“Even though Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause in 2012, it did so at a different place and a different time, and without the PLS data. So we’re still seeing things that no one has seen before.”As well as the plasma data, Voyager 2 is still sending back other information that confirmed the fact it has left the Solar System and will prove useful to scientists studying interstellar space. That region, known as the heliopause because it exists at the very edge of the Sun\u0027s influence, is still largely unknown to scientists.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But that was because the plasma sensors on that spacecraft had broken, and Voyager 2 can far more accurately sense whether it still has the sun\u0027s winds buffeting its back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He is widely thought to be seeking further concessions to bolster the deal’s popularity back in the UK, though British officials declined to comment on his presence.UK can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50, ECJ rulesMr Varadkar added: “I have no difficulty with statements that clarify what’s in the withdrawal agreement but no statement of clarification can contradict what’s in the withdrawal agreement.”He added that the backstop was part of the withdrawal agreement due to red lines imposed by the UK government.The Irish\u0026nbspPM, who has had a central role in negotiating Brexit due to the Irish border issue, may be referring to a so-called “side-declaration” – effectively an official commentary on how both sides expect the deal to be implemented.May calls off vote on Brexit deal amid massive Tory opposition Pound drops as Theresa May pulls Brexit deal voteUK can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50, ECJ rulesAll senior EU figures have taken a united line that the deal struck last month is the only one on the table.A spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters in Brussels on Monday afternoon: “We have an agreement on the table that was endorsed by the European Council in its Article 50 format on the 25 November. As President Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible.“We will not renegotiate, our position has not changed, and as far as we are concerned the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on 29 March 2019.”Created with Sketch.Brexit betrayal march in London Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester carrying a noose at the Brexit betrayal march.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

But that would not override the legally-binding\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement, and so is unlikely to satisfy Tory Brexiteers.\u0026nbspMs May\u0027s other calculation could be\u0026nbspthat simply by having one last throw of the dice and showing she is doing everything possible to secure the best deal, she is likely to win over a few of the Tory rebels. Again, though, that seems highly unlikely to be enough to get the deal through.\u0026nbspAll in all, then, it is unclear how Ms May returning to Brussels this week would significantly change matters...Theresa May appears to be a collision course with MPs over whether they will get a say over her decision to delay tomorrow’s ‘meaningful vote’ - writes deputy political editor Rob MerrickSome MPs were critical of the decision to shelve it – opening up the possibility that they could combine to force her to stage the vote, in what would be the ultimate humiliation of the prime minister.But The Independent understands that the government will not allow a vote on whether to pull the vote (if you’re keeping up!), but will simply choose not to move the planned debate today.A Commons clerk confirmed it had the power to do this.\u0026nbspA statement from Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, will follow the prime minister’s statement later.Nicola Sturgeon\u0026nbsphas accused Theresa May of pathetic cowardice and an unforgivable dereliction of responsibility after the prime minister decided to delay the Commons vote on her Brexit deal.\u0026nbspThe Scottish first minister said:\u0026nbsp“Assuming these reports are accurate, this is a watershed moment and an act of pathetic cowardice by a Tory government which has run out of road and is now collapsing into utter chaos.\u0026nbspIt is final proof that the interests of a deeply-ided Tory party matter far more to the prime minister than people’s jobs and living standards.\u0026nbspThat is an unforgivable dereliction of responsibility, and the UK government should now get out of the way and allow others to take charge.\u0026nbspTheresa May will give a statement in the Commons at 3.30pm, with speculation\u0026nbsprife in Westminster about what she might say. As far as I see it, these are five\u0026nbsppossibilities:\u0026nbsp1. Vows to return to Brussels this week in order to try to secure further concessions.2. Abandons the planned deal and pivots to planning for a no-deal Brexit.3. Announces plans for a second referendum.4. Calls a general election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp5. Resigns.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSteve Baker, the Eurosceptic ERG\u0027s main organiser, says:\u0026nbspThis is essentially a defeat of the prime minister\u0027s Brexit deal. The terms of the withdrawal agreement were so bad that they didn\u0027t dare put it to Parliament for a vote. This isn\u0027t the mark of a stable government or a strong plan.\u0026nbspHe added\u0026nbspParliament should be been allowed to voice its concerns about the proposed withdrawal agreement. Without a clear rejection of the terms by MPs, the prime minister has kicked the can down the road and the EU is very unlikely to re-negotiate.Jeremy Corbyn has responded to tomorrow\u0027s vote being delayed. He said:\u0026nbsp“The government has decided Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour.\u0026nbspWe have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst of all worlds deal was going to be rejected by Parliament because it is damaging for Britain. Instead, she ploughed ahead when she should have gone back to Brussels to renegotiate or called an election so the public could elect a new government that could do so.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We don\u0027t have a functioning government. While Theresa May continues to botch Brexit, our public services are at breaking point and our communities suffer from dire under-investment.\u0026nbsp“Labour’s alternative plan for a jobs first deal must take centre stage in any future talks with Brussels.”BREAKING: Theresa May has called off tomorrow\u0027s vote, a very well-placed source has told me.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But at the moment I’m looking at who is in the papers, who can we get behind, but it shouldn’t be about the personality it should be about the country.”\u0026nbspMs McVey\u0026nbspsaid she would support the prime minister if she were to go back to Brussels and try and renegotiate the deal, in particular around the Irish backstop and the £39bn ‘orce bill’ that Ms May’s withdrawal agreement accounts for.Mr Raab was interviewed on the same show, and asked if he would rule out a run, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked in to that debate.“The public and people watching this show would think it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in that speculation.”He would not comment when asked if he would stand aside for fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson to run for the leadership.It\u0026nbspcame as comments the government was hit by another resignation over the Brexit plan –\u0026nbspWill Quince, a ministerial aide to defence secretary Gavin Williamson.He hit out at the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland, saying it could result in the UK being “tied to the negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.For her part, Ms May warned Tory MPs they risk handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10 unless they back her Brexit deal in an interview with Mail on Sunday, .“It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,” she told the Mail on Sunday.“We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.“As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”Reports suggested Ms May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in an effort to win over critics of her plan.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Many firms cited Brexit uncertainty as a factor constraining investment and orders.“The marked weakening of the UK economy this autumn is as we expected given the continued high level of uncertainty around Brexit,” said John Hawksworth of PwC.“Until this is resolved, the UK economy is likely to remain in the doldrums as businesses will be reluctant to invest and households may also be reluctant to commit to big ticket items like house and car purchases.”Separately, the ONS also\u0026nbspreported on Monday that the UK’s goods trade balance in October widened to £11.87bn, higher than expected by City analysts.There was also a sharp downward revision to exports earlier in the year.This year’s trade boost has been suddenly revised away, reinstating this depreciation’s record as the least successful in Britain’s post-war history, said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.In the three months to October the deficit was £35.5bn. Good exports were up by 2.1 per cent over the three months, but this was outstripped by the increase in imports, which were 3 per cent higher.Including the services surplus, the total trade deficit was £3.3bn in October and £10.3bn over the quarter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Musk’s settlement with the agency saw him and Tesla each fined $20m, he was ordered to step down as chairman for three years, and the company was told it must introduce “additional controls and procedures to oversee Musk\u0027s communications, including his use of Twitter. The terms of the agreement must be met by 28 December.\u0026nbspElon Musk will not smoke cannabis on a podcast again, says Nasa bossElon Musk says he is probably going to go and live on MarsHow should a tech writer deal with Elon Musk?But on CBS News’ 60 Minutes programme, Mr Musk was asked: “Does someone have to read them before they go out?” He replied “No.” “So your tweets are not supervised?” interviewer Lesley Stahl asked. “The only tweets that would need to be, say, ‘reviewed’, would be if a tweet had a probability of causing a movement in the stock.”“Yeah, I mean, otherwise it’s ‘Hello first amendment’, like freedom of speech is fundamental,” Mr Musk replied.“But how do they know if it’s going to move the market if they’re not reading all of them before you send them?” Stahl asked.“Well I guess we might make some mistakes, who knows?” Mr Musk replied. “Are you serious?” Stahl responded.Elon Musk says tweet which cost him $20m was \u0027worth it\u0027“Nobody’s perfect,” said Mr Musk before looking away from Stahl and the cameras, and appeared to be fighting back tears.His emotional response did not go unnoticed by Stahl who then said: “Look at you.”Mr Musk quickly moved on to say he did not respect the SEC, but said he was abiding by the settlement because he did respect the justice system.The SEC’s legal filing in September also alluded to marijuana culture being a component in Mr Musk’s tweet saying he would take the firm private at $420 a share.In the US the number 420 is synonymous with marijuana consumption, and April 20 each year has become a celebrated date among smokers of the drug. “Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number\u0027s significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend \u0027would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price,’” the SEC filing reads.Later this year Mr Musk appeared on a live web show during which he was filmed smoking a spliff with the host, which caused Tesla’s share price to fall.During the 60 Minutes interview, when quizzed on the subject Mr\u0026nbspMusk said: “As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot, or anything. I don’t know how to smoke anything, honestly.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004542255871.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"why is the pm ploughing on","story":"She cannot sell the unsellable. Better to use the time in Brussels trying to fix the toxic “Irish backstop” which scores of her MPs and the DUP won’t stomach.Most people could live with the rest of her Brexit deal. But not a mechanism we cannot legally leave, potentially locking us ­forever into a customs union and iding upthe UK. Even an EU blinded by self-interest must see that.Downing Street’s defeatism is soul destroying.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is not the serious, sensible, unying compromise he believes. Nor does it deliver on the referendum.Joining EFTA — part of the European Economic Area — alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein would leave us nominally “out” of the EU. But that’s pretty much where it ends.We would still be in the single market, accepting free movement, with a supposed “brake” we would never deploy.Worse, we would remain in an EU customs union too, to “avoid” the mythical hard border in Ireland no one will ever build.We would effectively still be EU members  with no vote, nor power to strike our own trade deals — wrecking Brexit’s central economic case.It’s a non-Brexit that only satisfies Remainers. The Leave victory was motivated by a desire for sovereignty, including  control over immigration. This fulfils none of it. It won’t fly.Even a second referendum is better  — though obviously “Remain” cannot be on the ballot, the first vote having ruled it out.CAN the Government not see the obvious conclusion voters draw from its zombie-apocalypse vision of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street trots out these scenarios — medicines, food and water running short and bodies going unburied — like they were inevitable. But it was their job to prepare us. Had they done so from , we would be in good shape.Chancellor Philip Hammond actually considered it irresponsible to spend money on it. The Government, incredibly, feared upsetting Brussels.Now they’re saying: “Brexit’s coming! Look how little we’ve done to be ready.”It is jaw-dropping negligence.He seriously claims Labour could secure all the benefits of the single market while defying its rules, including on immigration, and staying in a customs union while doing our own trade deals.Literally none of it is possible.

The French would come for our fish and our banks. The Germans would want concessions on EU immigration.Other countries would want more money.It would be a nightmare negotiation. So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS.

What will be added by postponing the vote Nigel Dodds of the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, said: Look at the shambles of a Government having to pull a vote it said was the only way forward.And pro-EU Tory MP Anna Soubry told The Sun: I fear we are becoming the laughing stock of the world.This morning a No spokesman said Mrs May still intended to let MPs vote on her deal tomorrow.But minutes later she spoke to the Cabinet in an emergency conference call - then announced she would be making a Commons statement.Downing Street said she was updating ministers on her weekend phone calls with European heads of state.She called Angela Merkel, Irelands Leo Varadkar, top Eurocrats Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, and Dutch PM Mark Rutte.The Sun was the first to report a week ago that the Government was considering pulling tomorrows vote instead of suffering a public humiliation.The PMs Plan B is likely to be finding some way to guarantee the Irish backstop will never come into force without Britains consent.The future is now uncertain - with a new deal, No Deal Brexit or even a second referendum possibly on the table.Mrs May will this afternoon confirmed that the vote is delayed, with Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom announcing the parliamentary procedure used to pull the motion from the agenda.The PM is then scheduled to travel to Brussels later this week where she will pressure EU leaders to give her a better deal.Dozens of MPs have said they can never vote for the withdrawal agreement unless it offers a guarantee that Britain cant be trapped in the backstop.If she succeeds in tweaking the deal, it couldto the Commons either next week or after Christmas.But the Government could still lose the rearranged vote - which would trigger a letter from Mrs May setting out the way forward.MPs would be free to amend the PMs statement, directing ministers to adopt a dferent strategy such as calling a second referendum.Or the Government could adopt a radically dferent strategy such as pivoting to a Norway-style Brexit which keeps Britain in the single market.But without MPs agreeing on a new path, Britain will be on course to crash out of the EU without any deal.Mrs Mays own position could also be under threat - Labour have threatened to call a vote of confidence in Parliament which would topple the Government.And the PM will face a challenge to her leadership of the Tory party of her colleagues write letters calling for her to go.Mr Gove told the BBC: Of course we can improve this deal, and the Prime Minister is seeking to improve this deal.But he warned that Brussels might try to squeeze more concessions from the UK when talks on the deal reopen.Irelands deputy PM Simon Coveney said: The deal that is there between the UK and the EU is not going to change. I hope people will see it for what it is, which is a fair, balanced document.Mrs May will meet EU leaders at a summit on Thursday and Friday.Ministers this morning insisted the PM did still have a chance of winning the vote - hours before it was pulled.Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan hit out at the wreckers and called for the Tories to unite behind Mrs May.But Boris Johnson said the deal could be fixed as long as the PM ditched the backstop.He wrote in the Daily : We are told that the EU does not even like the backstop.Well,the EU doesnt like it, and the UK Government doesnt like it, and the British people dont like it, why on earth is it there  Let us get rid of it and move on."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire zombie pm theresa","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Zombie PM Theresa May is facing a Brexit exitMirror columnist says that the Prime Minister is finished - and it’s a question of when, not , history dumps herShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsopinionTheresa Mays days are numbered \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMigration is a gaping hole in zombie May’s Brexit scam.

Yet we still don’t know what the Prime Minister would do three months before Britain’s due to leave Europe and two-and-a-half years after that referendum. The glaring gaps in the PM’s plan –what replaces the movement of people with our  neighbours – has been put on the back burner. Her Cabinet’s split on this, like so many other issues including fishing, is another reason she’ll be defeated tomorrow and toppled. The dead woman walking, who in  lived to die another day, is finally running out of road. Despite repeated denials, she might be tempted to buy a reprieve by cancelling the date with destiny, scrapping the killer vote. The humiliation, however, would be so great she’d likely be ousted anyway. Stubborn May deserves no sympathy. She is a coldly calculating politician who is happy to roll in the gutter. Scared to confront lies of Tory Brextremists was cowardice. Posturing as championing the national interest while acting like a cheap partisan defines Mayism.   From the loss of , police officers to despatching racist “Go Home” vans, her record’s a long blemish. As Home shySecretary then PM, she approved of the austerity that brought the NHS to its knees, squeezed wages, imposed the hated bedroom tax and created a Universal Credit monster. Denouncing “burning shyinjustices” then looking the other wayor creating unfairnessis a second Tory female PM failing the “deeds not words” Suffragette test. May’s finished and it’s a question of when, not , history dumps her. Extending the Brexit deadline beyond March  is the only sensible option and Jeremy Corbyn’s warming to a people’s vote to end Parliament’s deadlock. An early election’s unlikely as Labour calling a no confidence vote could backfire, uniting Tory and DUP turkeys unlikely to back Christmas.

As the increasingly isolated Prime Minister begins the most tumultuous week of her premiership, she will need that support more than ever. Mrs May’s backbenchers are deserting her in droves ahead of tomorrow’s crunch vote on her Brexit deal, when she is expected to suffer a crushing defeat. More ministers are considering quitting including aid secretary Penny Mordaunt who is said to be weighing up her future. Downing Street insiders say the PM has adopted a bunker mentality, relying on a small circle of trusted advisors to get her through the turbulent days ahead. Mrs May’s cabinet colleagues have grown increasingly frustrated at her reluctance to acknowledge the scale of defeat she faces. “She’s just not listening,” says one. “What’s the point of holding the voteit ends up devastating her Brexit deal and her leadership.”  But Number  insists the vote will take place tomorrow night as planned. “She knows the numbers,” insists a senior aide. A defeat would, they believe, strengthen her negotiating hand. Her weakness at home could end up being a strength with the EU. “She may need a Margaret Thatcher handbag moment with Brussels,” says one minister. “But she needs to have something to put in it.” Her closest aides insist she does have a Plan B. It is based on an amendment tabled by loyalist Tory backbencher Sir Hugo Swire. There may also be “a few other tweaks” including on fishing. But the EU says there is little room for manoeuvre.  The withdrawal agreement is finished business, although they may be able to offer some “helpful” language on the Irish backstop being temporary. But Brussels insiders are clear: any suggestion the Government could make plans to exit the backstop within a year is no-go. Mrs May’s team has ruled out the Norway Plus option because of her red line on free movement. Only a dferent leader could pivot to it, and it could split the party. Her closest advisors believe that a second referendum is the most likely outcome. “We’re not preparing for it and she doesn’t want it but it might be the only way. We think that’s where we’ll end up,” one said. For all the war-gaming, Number  knows it has no control over the PM’s own fate. Labour is not currently expected to put down a vote of confidence straight after the vote, instead waiting until the PM reveals her next move. The real danger comes from within. Tory backbenchers are febrile, with Brexiteers hinting they are - finally - not far off the  letters needed to kick off a contest. It is unclear whether enough would then vote against her. The public may not thank them for leaving the country leaderless at a time of crisis. But it is the Tory party’s “men in grey suits” that pose her biggest risk: senior cabinet ministers telling her that it is time to go. Mrs May is determined to hang on. Tory insiders say Philip May is learning French and German.

The Committee on Standards has said the requirement on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, to consult them before beginning an inquiry relating to events more than seven years earlier was an unacceptable encroachment on her independence. It came as part of the response to the report by Dame Laura Cox which lted the lid on the toxic culture of bullying in Westminster. The committee, which itself blocked an investigation into Commons Speaker John Bercow, said the requirement to consult ahead of investigating former MPs should also be scrapped. Its report added that the powers of its seven lay members, which provide % of the membership, should have “equal status” with MPs on voting rights.  In May, the committee voted three-two against allowing the commissioner to investigate claims that Mr Bercow bullied staff. Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron, who chaired the committee at the time, said lay members should have voting rights. The Speaker has denied allegations that he bullied former private secretaries Angus Sinclair and Kate Emms. The committee’s acknowledged it “deeply regrets what has gone wrong” over bullying and harassment in the House of Commons. Its latest report said:commit ourselves to contributing to putting things right. The publication examined initial proposals for the House of Commons standards system following Dame Laura Coxs report. The committee report said: We agree with the commissioners view that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry relating to events more than seven years earlier is an unacceptable encroachment on her independence. We therefore recommend that this requirement should be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this.  We believe there should be no exceptions to the general principle that the committee does not seek to direct the commissioners operational decision-making. For that reason, we also recommend that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry into a former member should also be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this also. Labour MP Kate Green, who chairs the committee, said: It is vital that trust in the process is rebuilt, following the criticisms in Dame Laura Coxs report. Whilst there is clearly much more to be done, our recommendations will make an important step forward towards a fairer, more independent and credible system. The Standards Committee is unique in having an equal number of MPs and lay members on it, and these proposals will ensure that the skills and expertise of the lay members can help to hold MPs to account in the most effective way.

The page calling for her release attracted more than  followers, according to Plymouth Live . But today a post on the page said: “This page is not helping the cause and will be closing.

He said: “There have been threats of violence and death towards her. They found their way to her in several ways. A photograph of her has been sent to the prison she is likely to attend.

Khai Ho, , from Birkenhead, Liverpool, would often refuse his mothers meals as a child, claiming he has never felt hunger and food has never appealed to him. But over the last four years Khai, a healthy  stone in weight, claims that his commitment to the Hindu form of mediation has enabled him to give up food for three months at a time, only eating mints to stop the bitter taste in his mouth. Despite fasting for long periods of time, the pizza delivery driver says that he never struggles to resist the food he delivers to customers and that he has never been happier or healthier.  He said: I felt that this was something that I should have done my whole le. I have never really felt hunger and never took much interest in food as a child. My mum was always worried about me and still is, she often cooks for me and I have to tell her not to bother as I wont touch it. I could never really embrace that state of consciousness that I was after until about four years ago when it became more serious.  Before that I was maybe eating every three or four days but now I can go months without food or water and even then only have a mint or so to take away any bitter taste in my mouth. Its an amazing feeling, Im fully conscious of my mind and Ive never felt so great. Im fully aware of my surroundings. People think Im crazy but incredible at the same time. Khai claims that he gathers his nutrients from the sunlight around him and that he can even take in moisture that he needs from the air.  Inedia or breatharianism is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming food or water and Khai only eats small amounts of food and little water while mainly surviving on mints or chewing gum for a fresh taste. Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases water, are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by prana, the vital le force in Hindu religion. The -year-old claims that since embracing this unusual way of le that he now looks half his age and that a previous liver problems has also improved thanks to his prolonged periods of fasting. He said: It made me very aware of my surroundings and so awake that I often struggle to sleep. I suffered from pain with a liver problem and that has now gone thanks to mediation and fasting. I now know how to heal the human body internally and naturally from many major diseases. I never feel weighed down but people must be guided in this way of le as you can never be sure how others may reacted to it. The advice is that men need , calories a day to survive but I have proven the experts wrong.  Khai has no regrets about giving up the grub although it can be a little awkward when meeting in social situations but thathe was to met the love of his le he would at least give a romantic meal a try. He said: When I meet up with friends I normally arrange to do something  like shopping or going for walks as when we go for food I sit there while everyone  tucks in. I would never try and stop people eating around me because everyone is free to do as they want. If I were to go for a romantic meal I would have to at least give it a try and that would be very fair on my date. I do save a lot of money though as I never have to do any food shopping.

Meghan has been plagued with reports about her demanding behaviour over the last few weeks, and royal insiders have allegedly given her a new moniker. According to the Express, its claimed in some quarters that Meghan has been branded Duchess Dficult because shes a challenge to work for. This comes after sources claimed she is up sending emails at am - and her formidable work ethic is something that has tested palace officials.  Among rumours of her demanding behaviour, Meghan reportedly asked for air fresheners to reduce the musty odour in the chapel at her wedding. She was also apparently unhappy when she didnt get her first choice of tiara for the nuptials, an emerald encrusted piece that was denied as the palace werent sure of its origins.

Thomas Markle, , claims a small bag of the drug was offered to guests in fabric pouch, with a note from the bride and groom.Speaking about the unusual gt, Thomas, who is involved in a bitter feud with his daughter, said: Its illegal, but its no big deal in Jamaica.Its almost customary down there. I dont smoke weed and to the best of my knowledge neither does Meghan., reports the Mail Online.  Meghan and Trevor married at the Jamaica Inn in Ochos Rios booking all  rooms at the luxury accommodation. It was claimed neither her dad nor her half-sister Samantha Markle attended the nuptials, prompting fans to question how long their feud has been going on. Thomas has now spoken out to correct the lies he says have been spread about him. The retired Hollywood lighting director may have missed out on walking his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Chapel in May - but he had a starring role at her first wedding. The The Mail on Sunday reports that Thomas provided a photograph of him and Meghan moments before he and Doria walked her across the sand to be wed. The camera-shy father-of-the bride claims there are no pictures of him at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone  was in their s and I was in my s.  Thomas says Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail, including the unusual welcome gt for guests. Thomas also showed the newspaper Meghans first wedding invitation, which read: Cheers to love, cheers to laughter, cheers to happily ever after. Sadly, two years later, the marriage was over.Mr Markle also told how he is dreading his first Christmas without a card from Meghan saying: “I have been frozen out”.He revealed how they were once close in a series of heartfelt letters his daughter sent to him saying I love you with all my heart – now and forever’. The affectionate letters are addressed to ‘Daddy’. In one she vows: All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it.  In another she thanks her father for taking the best care of me and adds: I love you to no end. But Thomas says he is not expecting a Christmas card from his daughter or Harry this year adding: I have been frozen out and I can’t stay silent. I have made dozens of attempts to reach my daughter via text and letters, but she and Harry have put up a wall of silence. They have done what they once told me not to do – they are believing everything negative that has been written about me. So I am reaching out to them, once again, to try to correct the lies and get the truth out there.  Everyone says, why don’t I just shut the f*** up  That Meghan can’t speak to me because I’ll give away secrets. But that’s bull****. I’ve been accused of every terrible thing you can think of. In one magazine they had an awful story about Prince Charles right beside one about me. But no one is shunning Prince Charles. The fall-out with Harry and Meghan came after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.

The victim managed to flee her her home when Condor began to turn the blade on himself - but she was left critical ill with severe injuries to her head and hands. She underwent emergency treatment which saved her le but her terminally father passed away just nine days after the attack last February . She was left with one metres of scarring across her shoulder and head and suffers recurring nightmares about the incident. At Manchester Crown Court a heartbreaking statement from Miss Whetham was read out as Condor, was jailed for  years and eight months after he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He was originally charged with attempted murder but claimed he had been having cocaine fuelled meltdown.  She said: The events of this day will stay with me for the rest of my le. The person who I thought was the man of my dreams, to attack me with a machete is unjustiable. What did I do to deserve this - nothing as far as I can see and no one deserves what I went through. I am still hurting physically and mentally. I cant sleep much without sleeping tablets. Whatever sentence he gets will not make up what he did to me. I also lost my dad due to this. I remember could feel I was getting weaker as I left that house but all I could think about was that I wasnt going, I needed to see my dad.He only had months to live but didnt make it nine days after this and I didnt get to see him again as we lost him whilst I was in hospital. My mum should have been grieving for her soulmate but she was looking after her daughter again. I wasnt able to cut my own food or put on my own bra which was embarrassing as a woman. I have one metrein scarsthey were all put together. I feel like I lost everything that day. I can only hope he is remorseful and gets the help he needs. All I can do is try to move forward. Even now months later I am traumatised by it. I have constant recurring nightmares and need medication to sleep.I have had to go to the GP due to anxiety and upset I feel, and have been told I have PTSD and suffer from flashbacks. I have tried a number of antidepressants - I dont like taking them but they do help me. I get bad headaches and shooting pains due to the injuries. I have two scars that I am self conscious about, but my hair is finally growing back and I am starting to get the feeling back in my shoulder. I have a large scar on my shoulder. The injury on my hand is the most painful and it makes daily le dficult. I am right handed so this makes things hard. I just consider myself lucky to have survived. The court heard the couple had met in  during a night out and at first their relationship was good but he began to suffer from depression and took cannabis and cocaine and the romance began to crumble. Prosecutor Andrea Lock: She recounts there were more incidents of violence between them.He became violent towards her and was fuelled with paranoia and in the early hours of th February he had been on an alcohol and drug fuelled binge for  hours. As a measure of caution she withdrew from the downstairs area and went to bed - but did however make a conscious decision to remain fully clothed in case she needed to leave quickly in case he got violent. She awoke to find him raining blows on her back and head. Initially she thought he was punching her but as she tried to get into a seated position she realised she was bleeding. He was slashing her with a large machete which caused catastrophic wounds to her head and body. He then turned it on himself and chopped at his own neck. This gave her an opportunity to run from the bedroom and flee from the house. She sought help from a nearby neighbour who heard her screams. The neighbour tried to stop the bleeding and called emergency services. The defendant then appeared and collapsed. When tested, he had cannabis and cocaine along with alcohol in his system. When the machete was recovered after the incident, it was separated from the handle Sarah had severe injuries and went by ambulance to the major trauma unit at Manchester Royal Infirmary Hospital.She had extremely deep lacerations to her scalp and an open fracture to her skull which required surgical intervention. She had a laceration to her shoulder and head caused fracture to head and shoulder joint. She had an open fracture to her right hand.She had to have plastic surgery. She has suffered from extreme physical discomfort and psychology impact. In mitigation defence lawyer Mark Fireman said: He was under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He lost his mother to cancer - years ago and this caused signicant changes in his behaviour. This was the reason this last relationship broke down, due to drinking too much. This was a signicant factor in the relationship with the victim. Prior to the incident he had been on a binge for  hours. He didnt try to kill her but didnt dispute the fact he committed violence. He tried to take his own le. He said he will never drink again and is deeply remorseful, and knows there will be no consolation to her or her family. Sentencing Judge Michael Leeming said: There are many aggravating factors. Her injuries were so severe that she went to the major trauma unit at hospital, where she was treated. They are simply shocking. She had several wounds including a cm deep laceration on her shoulder. She had two smaller wounds on her shoulder and lacerations and fractures to her hand. These le changing injuries are signicant and were potentially le-threatening.

Paige Mills, , trains for two hours a day despite countless hours spent on a busy ward where she works as an emergency nurse. The super-fit, from Melbourne, Australia, says men are surprised when they find out she can lt more than them. Paige has worked as a registered nurse for three years since graduating, also working with patients in rehabilitation which has fulfilled her goal of having an impact on other peoples lives. Although she is incredibly busy at work, Paige thrives off the chaos and feels that the constant busyness is what keeps her mind and body stimulated.   Paige first found her love for fitness when she finished her nursing degree which made her feel inactive, making her want to burn off energy in the gym. Now, Paige works out for five or six days a week, for two hours each day. Her dedicated fitness regime is all thanks to Paige not owning a TV aerial at home which means she has plenty more time to work out because she doesnt watch any television. Through nursing, Paige has learnt to appreciate her fitness as she deals with patients who may never even walk again. Even during long periods of consecutive night shts Paige manages to maintain her fitness regime as she can squat kg and deadlt kg. At first I wanted to get a degree for the self-actualisation of doing it, but I decided I wanted to do something where I could have an impact on peoples lives instead, said Paige. Ive also tried out hospitality, driving trucks, being a dancer and a builders labourer, but then I found nursing and I also do some fitness modelling now too.   I studied to be a nurse for three years at university while I also worked as a carer in a nursing home, but Ive now been a registered nurse for three years since.I love the chaos of it being on my feet and doing a million things at once keeps my body and mind stimulated. Having gone from very physically demanding jobs before to then studying and working as a nurse made me feel very sedentary, so I felt like I needed to burn off some energy. Thats when I first found fitness and joined a gym. Now I will work out for two hours a day, five or six days a week. It can be hard to keep up with my routine sometimes when Im transitioning from day shts to night shts and when Im sleep deprived. In nursing we arent allowed to manually lt patients, so the strength isnt as handy as you may think, but back injuries are super common among nurses. I think powerlting has taught me the correct lting techniques, so hopefully Ill never have a work-related back injury. I hear people say they dont have the time to go to the gym, yet they watch two to three hours of television a day. Whereas I dont have a television aerial at home, so I guess theres time for anything you loveyou make it a priority, and training comes first for me of course.   Paige spoke about how she makes sure her diet fuels her busy schedule and ensuring she can recover properly. Patients will often comment on Paiges muscly physique and men are frequently surprised to find out that she can lt more than they can. Before I started lting, I wasnt able to distinguish between a woman with muscle and a woman carrying excess fat. But now I very often get patients commenting on my muscles, said Paige. The reaction I get from men is often saying wow, you can lt more than me. But I think people who have known me forever arent surprised that I ended up being somewhat of a public figure because Ive never been afraid of the limelight. Im a pretty open person.   I eat so much I try to eat a lot of protein and carbohydrates to fuel my workouts. If I dont eat enough, I wont perform well in training, which makes me feel frustrated. I usually eat around  to  calories a day. Nursing has taught me not to take any physical abilities for granted. I dont think people realise that there are people my age who are in stroke wards or in nursing homes and theyll never walk or talk again. You should exercise to celebrate your capacity to do so, and love your body for what it can do, not for how it looks. You can follow Paiges fitness regime by checking out her Instagram, @bikerbiddie.

At times it was scrappy, Hamilton had a couple of opportunities as well which flew by the post, and shows games at this level are dficult to win but we got the breaks at the right times.“I thought in some of our play you could see a confidence appear when we got the second and third goal, we started to knock the ball about and created opportunities.“First and foremost we just wanted to win the game, it didn’t matter how but to score four goals was fantastic. We got a wee bit of luck with deflections with a couple of the goals but the most important thing for me was we were trying to do the right things, we were going into the right areas and encouraging more forward passes, more crosses into the box.“If you do that then sometimes you get the wee breaks, which we did.”Jesse Curran grabbed his first senior goal with the aid of a deflection but it was hat-trick hero Miller who grabbed the limelight.Jim added: “He was fantastic.“I think he said it was the seventh or eighth hat-trick of his career and to do it at , Kenny deserves a lot of credit.“His second and third goals were great finishes.“I’m delighted for him but more so the team because it was great to keep the clean sheet, especially with Darren O’Dea going off just at the end.“I was desperate to keep that clean sheet because I thought the boys deserved it and big Jack Hamilton came up with a big save to play his part.”O’Dea is likely to miss out against Rangers on Sunday with a possible tear in his groin muscle."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a9db68df84.jpg ","title":"dundee shopping centre expects 1m visits ahead of christmas","story":"About one million people are expected to pass through the doors of a Dundee shopping centre in the run-up to Christmas.More than , people visited the Overgate last week alone, with numbers expected to remain steady from now until the big day.Both the Wellgate and Overgate shopping centres are expecting high levels of footfall as shoppers snap up the last of their gts and Christmas essentials.Malcolm Angus, centre manager at the Overgate, expects the six- figure number of people to pass through the centre’s doors throughout this month.Mr Angus said: “It is still a little early to compare year-on-year, but the centre continues to be extremely busy.“Last week there were , visitors and for the year to date, we have welcomed just under  million people.“During December we would estimate around one million visitors through the doors with the week commencing December  anticipated to be Overgate’s busiest week.“We have extended the £ tarf for all day Sunday parking and this year’s Overgate Santa event begins in two weeks to further enhance our provision for families.”While the Wellgate Centre hasn’t provided figures on its projections for this month, centre manager Peter Aitken said the outlook was “very positive”.Mr Aitken said: “The second half of the year has been particularly positive for Wellgate, with a brand new gym and the more recent opening of TJ Hughes, which has provided a much-needed boost to the centre’s retail offering.“We also had a fantastic turnout at our Christmas lights switch-on event, attracting an increase on the last two years’ audience numbers.”The centre boss added that theof TJ Hughes after its closure in  was helping to “reinvigorate” the centre.He said: “With TJ Hughes reporting strong sales already, and the shop reinvigorating the entrance to the centre more generally, we are confident that our footfall and sales will be very positive as we welcome December and, looking further ahead, the post-Christmas sales.“We are very much looking forward to welcoming shoppers through our doors in the weeks ahead.”Toy stores, including city newcomer Smyths, have reported “definite” increases in footfall and spend in the build-up to December .Viv Hamilton and Dave Blair, owners of the Quirky Coo on Union Street, said the opening of the VA has resulted in an increase in business for them, with footfall up %.Dave said: “It seems to be more customers are coming in for a nose just because they are passing.“Christmas time every year is really busy.“There are still new people finding us.“We aim for the people of Dundee and the tourists that come are almost a bonus to us.”Viv added: “This is the busiest time of year for us without at doubt.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a4d2bd11e3.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds callum booth says ayr loss was a needed wake up call","story":"As tough as it was to take, Dundee United full-back Callum Booth believes last Friday’s - home defeat at the hands of Ayr was the wake-up call they needed at this stage of the season.Defender Booth admits it was a shock to the system for the Tangerines losing so heavily to the Championship leaders at Tannadice last week but insists the result is behind them as they aim to regain momentum built under new boss Robbie Neilson.The Terrors were unbeaten in six until the loss to The Honest Men and the -year-old feels they have got what it takes to go on a similar run – starting at Morton today.“We’d been doing brilliantly since the new manager came in and I don’t think anyone saw that scoreline coming at all,” the former Hibs and Partick Thistle left-back said.“It was a shock and maybe a bit of a wake-up call. We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee west hail 2018 as the pinnacle of their 33 year history in city","story":"Dundee West Football Club are toasting their best year in the club’s -year history after a massive awards night at the Caird Hall a week last Friday.With membership now in excess of  people, West packed out the city centre venue to celebrate the achievements of their younger boys and girls football sections over the course of  – with Dundee United players Nicky Clark and Lewis Toshney in attendance to hand out some prizes.However, the whole of Dundee West have enjoyed a terric  months on and off the pitch.Highlights for the Charlotte Street-based club include winning the Best Community Football Club award at the Scottish Football Association’s Grassroots Awards back in October as well as visits and training sessions delivered by the likes of Scotland international Lisa Evans and former Westies Cammy Kerr and Maurice Ross.The club has also seen growth in their social inclusion activities such as para-football, over s and walking football. The latter social element is something club secretary Paul Gibson and club development officer Tam McCabe are particularly proud of on reflection.Gibson , who has been affiliated with the club for  years, said: “We’ve always been a community club in the  years and the people that got us up and running back then deserve credit as well for where we are now.“We’ve come to the pinnacle almost and we want to stay at that.“Over my time here we’ve been able to create a legacy.”McCabe added: “Dundee West is a club that can provide a full family pathway to kids and adults, or maybe players who have a disability, the chance to play the game.“I’ve been able to come in and meet head teachers and other local partners to find out what the needs of the community are.“We will continue to grow as a club but we want to also have an impact on hard-to-reach groups that maybe aren’t able to afford to get into the club or lost confidence.“We want to engage with them, support them and use football as a tool to bring them into Charlotte Street and work together.“That’s key to being seen as more than just a football club and, I think, that’s why we’ve been recognised as the best community club.”The club hopes to grow further next year with plans to expand their girls section, work closely with more local primary schools and hopes for an articial pitch at Charlotte Street.Gibson said: “We want to go into schools and build partnerships in the community. We want to make Dundee West a big part of people’s lives – something they have a tie to forever from the age of five onwards.”McCabe said the club can be the envy of and inspiration to others in the local area, adding: “Dundee West are at a point where they say ‘right we’re this big now but where do we go from there ’“We’ve got the G pitch project at Charlotte Street we’re very keen to look at and we know there’s a need with the sheer number of players.“For us to get there we need to make sure we’re occupying and benefitting the community.“We’re working with schools to deliver numeracy and literacy – it’s massive for them. I walk into school and it’s like Messi or Ronaldo for them. If you get told you’re the best club in Scotland, of course kids want to be involved in that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a9db08ec57.jpg ","title":"lochee united fan alex hands back 500 of jackpot lottery win for new players lounge","story":"Lochee United season ticket holder Alex Marshall has handed back £ of his jackpot club lottery win to help fund a new players’ lounge.Alex received a £, windfall when his number came up and has given some back to be used for the redecorating of a lounge in tribute to a former player.Ian Anderson died in May while on holiday.

Thanks to smart meters we can all help keep the lights on.From our favourite gadgets to intelligent household appliances, whether we’re shopping, travelling or working, we’re increasingly looking to electricity to power us on.And we’re set to need it even more.For a start, the British Government wants  per cent of new vehicles to be powered by electricity by  and the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans to end by .At the same time, greener energy sources such as wind and solar power are being introduced. ScottishPower recently became the first major UK energy company to announce plans to source all its electricity from wind.The nation’s energy landscape is undergoing rapid change.So how can we be sure that the lights stay on, and our electricity continues to be available at the flick of a switch Behind the scenes, Government and energy suppliers have been working hard to make sure the electricity network remains reliable while depending on unpredictable natural resources such as the wind to produce power.And closer to home, the arrival of millions of household smart meters means we can all play a part.By the end of the rollout, there should be  million gas and electricity smart meters in homes and small businesses across Britain, providing vital energy use information, which will also help plan for the country’s changing energy needs – such as increased demand for electricity with the mass adoption of electric vehicles.If we were all to drive our electric cars home after work and plug them in to charge overnight, our national grid would not be able to cope with the amount of electricity needed – i.e. the supply and demand for electricity would not be balanced and the network could find itself under strain.Smart metering and its near-real time transmission of energy data means suppliers will be able to regulate the amount of electricity powered through the grid, and ensure that we can keep our country’s lights on even in times when demand is highest.In simple terms, the energy suppliers will be able to more accurately predict how much energy to produce every hour of every day, to cope with our changing habits and ensure the country doesn’t ever face a blackout.And looking to the future, new flexible tarfs may allow people to use high-consumption items – like car charging points – at the cheapest times.With a nationwide network of smart meters in place, the electricity supply will be easier to maintain and give us greater reliability over our country’s power – good news for all of us.You can get your smart meter from your gas and electricity suppliers. vw, px\"  Smart Energy GB is the government backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the benefits of the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/shutterstock_494205820-376x564.jpg ","title":"sponsored how tech facilitates a smarter life for all","story":"We’ve come a long way from the first mobile phones and home computers. So how will technology improve our lives in the future Stereotypes would have us believe that technology is the provenance of the young.But market research has demonstrated that the over-s – people who remember when mobile phones were the size of a doorstop and home computers were a neighbourhood novelty, not a home-place necessity – are every bit as tech savvy as their younger counterparts. vw, px\"  According to recent research by Deloitte,  per cent of people aged - own an app-enabled smartphone, with face recognition technology – which avoids the need for fiddly passwords – particularly popular.Meanwhile, another study by Oxford University showed voice-recognition speakers, like Amazon Echo and Google Home, are used more frequently by over-s than - year olds.With technology now well embedded in the lives of the older consumer, what can we look forward to Technology enthusiast, Craig Sinclair, says smart gadgets that will make our lives easier and even save money are set to become commonplace in many homes.“For example, I’ve got smart lighting which I control using an app on my phone,” he says. “I can see it becoming increasingly popular for people who need help to live independently.“Plus, since I installed it, my energy bills have gone down.”If Craig were to pair his smart lighting with a smart meter, then not only could he control his lighting from the comfort of his chair, he would also be ideally positioned to save further money on his energy bills by monitoring his usage, and working out where he could cut back on his consumption.This is all part of a move towards household items becoming smarter across the board. Things like kettles, washing machines and dishwashers will have smart technology built in, and know when to switch on at the most energy efficient – therefore cheapest – times of day. But such innovations in household technology will only be possible once we all have smart meters, and our country is powered by smarter grids. Their near-real time transmission of energy data means suppliers can communicate with smart meters and such appliances to give them the information they need to optimise energy consumption.Rather than make people#s lives more complicated, advances in smart technology are working to make our lives simpler and more cost effective. vw, px\"  Smart Energy GB is the government backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the benefits of the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/Royal-Bank-of-Scotland-250px-1.jpg ","title":"sponsored scottish bank creating space for discovery and innovation","story":"How Royal Bank of Scotland is embracing creativity and technology to build a safe and secure future for customers.From William Cullen inventing the fridge, to Sir Alexander Fleming discovering penicillin, Scots have long led the way with innovations that changed lives . . . and continue to influence us today.These iconic innovators stand alongside John Logie Baird, Mary Somerville and Alexander Graham Bell as just a few of those at the vanguard of Scotland#s powerful heritage of innovations and discovery.Their contribution means that the country is synonymous with technology and modernisation — and Royal Bank of Scotland is now flying that flag with pride.The bank, which printed Europe#s first multi-coloured banknote back in  and introduced fingerprint ID to its customers in , has a proud history of embracing innovation.Royal Bank of Scotland brought the first ATM – Cashline – to Scotland in the s and was also one of the first UK banks to launch a comprehensive internet banking service, banking services and facilities that we take for granted today.Shaping the bank’s technological future is Kevin Hanley. With more than two decades of experience in financial institutions across Europe and the USA, he is responsible for helping the bank to meet the innovation challenges it faces.“At Royal Bank of Scotland, we are always coming up with creative ideas and solutions that suit a world that doesn#t pass us by,” he says.“The scale of innovation is huge, we are seeing fundamental changes taking place in the world of financial technology with increasing regularity. It is becoming harder and harder to be truly disruptive. We#re looking for things that can be delivered into the hands of our customers at scale.”Those creative solutions have resulted in customer tools which were once the reserve of the pages of science fiction. Facial recognition is part of the bank’s safety and security log-ins face ID is now used by customers to log in securely to their account via their phones.Cora, a web-based chatbot, is also changing the way people interact with technology and banking. Developed to answer basic customer questions, this year Cora held more than one million conversations with customers to solve their queries.For Dan Salmons, Director of Innovation, Home Buying and Ownership, customers are at the heart of every new development: “Innovation should solve a business problem. If you don#t have a problem, then don#t fix it. I love solving problems to help people see a way through any obstacles. The best things for me are the things which change customers lives, evenit#s something small.”Like many of Royal Bank of Scotland’s technology leaders, he is passionate about coming up with new solutions to solve business issues but remains realistic about the role of innovation.“I like new technology and I like old technology that continues to work, but what I really like is new things that work better than old things. I love coming across a product that fits a hole that I know I#ve got,” he says.Keeping track of expenses for businesses can be a challenge, so Royal Bank found a technology-led solution to help its customers and added new features to its award-winning Receipts and FreeAgent apps to help iniduals and small businesses look after their finances.Other technology related introductions by the bank include placing TechXperts at Royal Bank of Scotland branches to help customers use online and mobile banking launching Esme Loans, a digital lending  that allows small and medium-sized businesses in the UK to quickly get unsecured loans of up to £, and the creation of completely paperless mortgages, a service which only Royal Bank of Scotland offers.While Royal Bank may be consistently pushing boundaries of innovation and service, it is important that customers are comfortable and confident with the technology they are using. That#s why measures like TechXperts, have been introduced, alongside the Secure Banking Promise and the Little Book of Big Scams, produced in partnership with Police Scotland, to help keep customers safe and help people make use of the technology that is available.According to Louise Smith, Head of Digitisation, Personal and Business Banking at Royal Bank of Scotland, this is an exciting time.“It#s a massively exciting time in banking and financial services,” she enthuses. “There are thousands of opportunities appearing each day and the challenge is to decide which ones will bring the most benefit to our customers and society.#Kristen Bennie created Open Experience at Royal Bank of Scotland to help staff across the business work together on exciting new solutions. The creative space based at the bank’s headquarters in Gogarburn in Edinburgh is a hub where design and technology collide to develop new products, services and experiences.She explains: “Some of the most exciting innovation currently taking place is focused on improving connectivity. Technology can have massively powerful benefits when it comes to bringing people closer to their friends and family as well as businesses with their customers.“New technology helps inspire me that everything is possible. The only limits are our imagination. That thought alone is truly exciting.”To learn more about what the bank is doing, click here. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"swansea city eye up move for dundee midfielder glen kamara","story":"Swansea City are eyeing up a move for Dundee’s star midfielder Glen Kamara, the Tele can reveal.The English Championship side were linked with a move for the Finnish international last summer, among a host of others.And with the -year-old available to sign on a pre-contract in January as he moves into the final six months of his contract, the Welsh club have stepped up their interest.Manager Graham Potter had a scout in attendance at Dens Park for Dundee’s impressive - victory over Hamilton on Wednesday.And the Swans will be keeping a keen eye on how Kamara fares against Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on Sunday.They are unlikely to be the only ones, however, with the Gers themselves and Old Firm rivals Celtic credited with interest in the summer while Hearts and Hibs are also keen on the former Arsenal man.Meanwhile, Dark Blues boss Jim McIntyre says the loss of centre-back Darren O’Dea is a blow as he prepares his side to take on Rangers on Sunday.The experienced defender has played a big part in Dundee’s recent revival under their new manager but limped off against Accies on Wednesday.And that calf injury is almost certain to keep him out of the weekend clash.Jim said: “Picking up the injury with Darren is a blow because him and Gensyhave done well together but there are other good players here who need to step in and show what they can do.”n Long-serving directer Steve Martin has retired from his position on the board.In a statement, Martin said a need to spend more time with his family and pursue other business interests was behind the decision."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0ab2d177bf6.jpg ","title":"tesco staff hand over 370 gifts for kids in dundee and perth","story":"Staff at the Tesco Customer Engagement Centre have been busy collecting for the Help for Kids Christmas toy appeal.This year the company handed over  gts to the charity so that a child in need across Dundee and Perth would have something to open on Christmas Day.Help for Kids manager Stacey Wallace said: “I just want to say thanks to everybody.

So you couldnt attribute that solely to training.\"The staff shortages became part of growing dissatisfaction with rail services, with many passengers hitting out through social media.One was Inverness man David Balfour who said his train trip to Inverness on Sunday was \"packed to the rafters\" with dozens invading First Class and sitting on the floor.And yesterday there was widespread disruption when a signalling fault near Aviemore led to cancellations and delay.There was also a problem with the .am service out of Inverness to Edinburgh after a fault in the brakes was detected only yards from the station and the train was cancelled.Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoScotRailrsquos performance has been plummeting, official figures have shown.ldquoMeanwhile, reliability is getting worse too and with winter under way, ScotRail passengers have also been experiencing widespread disruption while continuing to pay extortionate sums for failing services.ldquoIf new timetables add to those woes then the Scottish Government must act.\"Labour forced a vote in the Scottish Parliament asking the Government to scrap the ScotRail franchise - but the SNP joined forces with the Tories to vote it down.This week transport secretary Chris Grayling was told he should resign over the \"chaotic rollout\" of new railway timetables in England.A UK government transport select committee report into the widespread disruption to tens of thousands of passengers back in May, said Mr Grayling should have been more proactive to prevent the delays caused by the timetable changes, which saw Govia Thameslink Railway fail to run  per cent of its planned service in the weeks following May , and Arriva Rail North not running around  per cent of its trains.Monday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118738.jpg","title":"Rose Window to enjoy new lease of life","story":"A TREASURED stained glass window salvaged several decades ago from a building demolished in the city centre could see the light of day again.That is the hope of Highland Council who is looking to seethe window, regarded by many to be a work of art, can be fitted into the new Inverness Castle project.A campaigner who has pressed for years to get the intricate window re-installed said it was music to his ears.Bill Anderson, former Inverness Local History Forum chairman, was \"absolutely ecstatic\" and believes many others will feel the same.The giant Rose Window began le as part of an th century Methodist church where it had pride of place at the junction of Inglis Street and Hamilton Street, facing Academy Street.But a road-widening project almost  years ago, making Academy Street two-way and creating scope for the Eastgate Centre to be built, meant the demolition of the restaurant.The relic was packed away and is still boxed at the cityrsquos roads department.And now the Courier can reveal it stands a good chance of becoming an eye-catcher once again, studding Inverness Castle and playing a prominent part in ongoing plans to relocate the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service from that site to create a ldquomust-see visitor centre \"celebrating the spirit of the Highlands\".There were murmurings earlier this year that it could be a feature in the new station faccedilade at Inverness Railway Station.However, the council said it has other plans, although nothing has been agreed.Stuart Black, director of development  infrastructure, said the window could not feature as part of the original castle building.ldquoThe castle is a Category A listed building so any re-use would have to be in a new build element of the project,\" he said.\"We are a very early stage in the process of concept design for any new building in the vicinity of the castle.Mr Andersonsaid: \"Im absolutely ecstatic that the council is planning on using it there.

But they are professional athletes and should be able to deal with three matches in a week.Ultimately it was the lack of cutting edge in attack that was the Reds’ downfall.The rest of the team have had to handle the burden of grabbing goals as the Dons have had more dferent goal-scorersthan any other side in this season’s Premiership.That the Dons started with relative rookie Sam Cosgrove in both games against the Old Firm in Glasgow last week underlined the paucity of goals.A £, signing from Carlisle United in January, the -year-old striker has netted just three times in his senior career.Two of those came in a - Premiership defeat of struggling St Mirren two months ago.That inexperienced Cosgrove relegated on loan Manchester United striker James Wilson, who has netted in the English top flight, and £, signing Stevie May to the bench was an indictment of the goal drought.With Cosgrove suspended May was given the nod to hunt for his first league goal since a - defeat of former club St Johnstone on March .It was centre-back Scott McKenna who netted the vital goal in the - win at Rangers.If Aberdeen are to have any chance of replicating the last four seasons in the league they need a striker to deliver those big goals, and to do that regularly.Another crucial factor is that the strikers also have to get the service from midfield to allow them to score.May was left to run around and feed off scraps against Saints.It was May who created the first chance in the ninth minute when he raced onto a Connor McLennan pass in the penalty area. May drilled low across the face of goal but his  yard effort flashed inches wide.Dons keeper Joe Lewis reacted quickly to push behind a vicious  yard drive from Matty Kennedy at the near post in the th minute. Moments later Scott McKenna drilled a powerful  yard effort just over. In the final minute of a dismal first half McKenna again threatened when he met a corner but his  yard header was saved by the ing Zander Clark.After the fireworks and high of the win at Ibrox the first  minutes were a damp squib.In the th minute McLennan fired in a low drive from  yards but Clark got down to save. Moments later McLennan again shot over from range.Saints had a strong penalty appeal when Shay Logan appeared to catch the legs of Ross Callachan, but the referee waved play on. It was a let off.Yet Aberdeen went behind in the st minute when they failed to cope with a corner from David Wotherspoon. Former Don Joe SHAUGHNESSY rose above Andy Considine and fired in a bullet header from  yards.It got worse for the Reds when substitute Blair ALSTON broke past a challenge from Dom Ball and raced at goal.

For any player to be at their best we have to make sure they are as fresh as possible.“We will rest them down and look after them again on Monday.“We will be mindful of the demands coming up and hopefully can give a strong  minute performance, rather than just a decent  minute performance, and get back to winning ways.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen born actress to take part in charitys christmas fundraising event","story":"Aberdeen-born star Sophie Kennedy will take part in a Christmas celebration for charity.The actress, who co-starred in BBC drama The Cry, will take part in the Guid Noel at St Machar’s Cathedral tomorrow.Featuring Sophie’s mother Fiona Kennedy among the performers, the night will raise funds for social care charity VSA’s mental health services in Aberdeen.Sophie said: “I’m really excited about coming home, I don’t come home enough.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShop locally or risk losing our distinctive shops.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr brute battered neighbour during","story":"NewsAyr brute battered neighbour during disputeHe also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man landed in the dock for beating up another in a neighbourly dispute. Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

Reporter Hilary Scott went along to find out more...PRIORSFORD Primary School welcomed a new addition to the register this week, and she goes by the name of Peggy.As I signed in at the school, I note the reason for my visit as meeting Priorsfordrsquos new pupil who will be joining Mrs Sharprsquos P class.But Peggy isnrsquot your average pupil. In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend. But at this Peebles school, dog is the best friend of over  pupils who have become the proud owners of this gorgeous puppy Peggy, who has brought joy, happiness and love to her new home at Priorsford Primary."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":"This week Bosco Santimano, founder and executive director of social enterprise You Can Cook, shares his thoughts on organic farming.Most of us are already conditioned into believing the so called lsquomagicrsquo of science. That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast -

been supporting Campbeltown Sailing Club throughout the inception and evolution of Kintyre Seasports SCIO.#We are very pleased to see the project move forward to the current position where a broad range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all in reaching this point and look forward to being a part of one of Scotland#s most innovative water sport developments.#The seasports initiative has boosted membership at Campbeltown Sailing Club from

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

They had just had their first child and Jacine, who worked in corporate marketing, was mulling over ways to better achieve a work-le balance.\"The nine-to-five wasnt working,\" she recalls. \"I wanted to spend more time with my daughter Mahya when she was still young. I felt bad going back to work when she was nine months old and putting her into nursery. Everything came to a head.\"Jacine, , decided to take a three-month sabbatical from her job so they could stay on in Uganda and figure out a plan. \"By the end of that three months we decided to start a business,\" she says.That business was making rum. Jacine, who grew up in South London, has proud Jamaican roots. Her grandparents were part of the Windrush generation who had arrived in the UK during the s.\"I married into a beautul Ugandan family and spent a lot of time in Uganda and Kenya where I had seen lots of sugar cane,\" she says. \"I was asking for rum and I was never able to get any.

It became a mission to showcase Africa in the world of fine spirits.\"Pauls favourite tipple has long been whisky. \"We dont really drink rum in East Africa,\" he says. \"For me, marrying into a Caribbean family was an education. My drink was always Scotch whisky, but when you go to a Caribbean party, you cant really bring Scotch whisky hellip\"Jacine shakes her head, laughing heartily at the notion. \"Her relatives taught me about Jamaican rum and introduced me to all the brands,\" Paul adds. \"It made me wonder why I had never tried rum before. When it is made well it is a beautul spirit.\"Together the couple began to learn more about rums from across the Caribbean islands while pondering how to make their own East African iety. \"We had the idea to launch Matugga not having any experience in the sector,\" says Jacine. \"We saw a gap in the market and went for it.\"Everything had to reflect our positioning which was Africa and the UK ndash this interesting duality ndash and nobody  was doing that.

Initially the duo worked with a contract distiller but since moving to Scotland have been able to begin production in their own facility at Brucefield Industry Park, West Lothian.Their move to Scotland came about when Paul, a civil engineer by trade, began studying for an MSc in Brewing and Distilling at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The couple have fallen in love with their new base since arriving last year. Livingston is home now.Paul is the master distiller for Matugga with Jacine, who has experience in business start-ups alongside her marketing background, taking on the role as CEO.They make an impressive and formidable team. Jacine is the more outgoing of the two, warm and gregarious, while Paul is a little shyer and softly spoken but clearly every bit as driven as his we. He admits that ideas for new recipes are constantly percolating in his mind.Later, when Jacine is getting her photograph taken over by the rum casks, Paul talks me through some his latest \"experiments\" for future Matugga limited edition expressions. His eyes light up as he speaks. This is a man who has clearly found his vocation.\"I almost cant sleep at night,\" he says with a grin. \"I have so many ideas. It is only through having our own distillery that you begin to realise what is possible. You dont really understand a spirit until you have smelled and tasted it being made from the start.\"By doing that you get to know where all those little flavours come from, the bits that you dont usually get to taste because they never make it to the bottle. It is a huge spectrum.\"His latest prototype, says Jacine, has sent them down a new and unexpected road. A ripple of excitement passes between them as they talk about the future. \"There is definitely going to be more,\" they say in unison.\"We have released a Mavuno range with a special edition each year,\" says Paul.

One of the options offered to those who contributed was the opportunity to purchase a private rum cask.\"Similar to whisky cask ownership, you would buy a rum cask and we would look after it for three years,\" says Paul. \"Rum doesnt need a long maturation phase. We project within three years it would be very delicious and ready for bottling.\"We think that will coincide with the point that rum becomes the next thing.

The quality of Scotch whisky is the highest in the world in terms of distilled spirits and I knew thatwe were going to align ourselves with good standards it was going to be in Scotland.\"He has found other upsides too. \"The benefit of Scottish water is that there are not a lot of minerals in it. It is very soft water. You can imagineyou had a kettle down south, the inside would be covered in white stuff.\"We would have to remove all that stuff from the water and it would clog up the purication filter. It is an absolute nightmare to make wine, beer or spirits from.\"The water here is fantastic for brewing and distilling. The weather helps, too, because we generally have cool temperatures and a moderate summer in Scotland, so we are not over-ageing our rum stock. It is gently maturing in a way you can control it.\"If you were distilling, for example, in the United Arab Emirates you would need to put the casks in a basement with air conditioning. Scotland is perfect to mature spirits.\"The name Matugga comes from family owned land in Uganda. \"Traditionally in Uganda when you get married your father gives you a piece of land to grow crops and feed your family,\" says Paul.\"My brother was given a piece of land he didnt particularly like, so he decided to sell it and buy land with my mum in Matugga.

We are being told to do something that is sugar cane based hellip\"Jacine takes up the thread. \"It was a very spiritual time,\" she says. \"My family is from Jamaica and Africa is my heritage.

It was a bottle of South African sparkling wine by the vintner Graham Beck. The wine was good, but it wasnrsquot special - it was the occasion which made the wine great.It was  years ago, and Hoyrsquos we Mary had just given birth to their first baby Emily. The couple were living in South Africa, working in the wine business, and after their daughterrsquos christening, Justin and Mary journeyed into the bush and drank the sparkling Beck amid one of the most beautul landscapes on earth with their newborn baby beside them.lsquoIt was probably not the best sparkling wine in the world, but for that occasion it was absolutely perfect,rsquo says Hoy. Thatrsquos what wine does, it underscores the events in le which matter. Mary laughs and says hersquos making them sound like terrible parents, drinking in the wild with their baby.Hoy hates the expression lsquowine expertrsquo but like it or not thatrsquos what he is, one of Scotlandrsquos best connoisseurs. Spend an hour in his company and yoursquoll learn more about wine than you could from a decade of experimenting as an amateur wine buff on your own.As National Wine Week comes to an end today, Hoy is singing the praises of wine and the role it plays in human culture and society. Wine has been with us for at least  years - the earliest archaeological record of wine-making is dated to about BC in Armenia. Wine writer Aaron Pott says there is a theory, though, that wine is much older - that wine began when some ancient human lsquochanced upon some wild vines in late fall, their bunches well past ripe, rotten and slightly fuzzy with a blush of mouldrsquo. They would have tasted the sticky juice and become euphoric - and so wine quickly became part of religion as it seemed to connect us to the gods. The ancient Greeks and Romans deied wine in the rites of Dionysius and Bacchus - and it remains embedded in our culture today.lsquoWine is so important in society as we use it as the major part of any celebration,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoHumans are incredibly gregarious, we love celebrating and will find any reason to be together whether itrsquos a birth, christening, marriage, finishing school - we find reasons to have a celebration, and the major part of that celebration is when wersquore toasting whoever it is thatrsquos getting married or winning a race.lsquoTake that same idea across to a dinner party. It doesnrsquot matter how many people are coming, when they cross your doorstep yoursquoll give them a beer or a gin and tonic, but thatrsquos not why you invited them - the reason you invited them is that part of the evening when yoursquore all sitting around the table focused on each other and having a good time and the food comes out and yoursquoll notice all the other drinks go out the window and are replaced by wine - wine becomes the centre of the table. We change to wine as that is the celebratory part of the evening. Thatrsquos the importance of wine, itrsquos all about the occasion. Itrsquos how we celebrate.rsquoHoy has spent his le in the wine trade. Born in England, he married a Scot and the pair went to South Africa to run a vineyard. He later moved back to Scotland, where he now runs the Glasgow Wine School.The secret to winersquos beloved role in human le is its connection to food and social interaction. Sure, says Hoy, you can drink it to lsquoget pissedrsquo but therersquos much more to wine than that - unlike other drinks which exist primarily to get you drunk.Food is at the heart of every culture on earth, and wine elevates food. Wine is completely natural, like the best food - itrsquos just grape juice, yeast and sunshine. In wine, itrsquos the acidity and the tannins - the chemicals extracted from the grape skin that dry the mouth - which, when matched with a simple plate of food, can create something sublime. Other alcoholic drinks donrsquot have the same type of acidity thatrsquos found in white wine or the tannins in red wine.lsquoAcidity is a really good palate cleanseryou are eating fatty food,rsquo says Hoy. lsquoOne of the most magical food and wine parings is champagne and fish and chips.rsquo The fatty, oily fish and chips coat the inside of the mouth, and that deadens taste buds leaving the brain bored with whatrsquos being eaten. A sip of acidic champagne washes the mouth clean and the palate is ready to experience the taste of fish and chips all over again.With tannins itrsquos all about the interaction with salt - think of a hearty stew or a bowl of spaghetti bolognese, a lot of the flavour comes from the salt in the food. lsquoSalt suppresses the perception of tannins,rsquo Hoy says, lsquoand once it does that it gives the impression of the wine being more fruity. One of the things we know works really well is a nice big steak with an Argentinian Malbec [a red] - itrsquos become one of the great things in le. Malbec has a very high tannin level and when we cook steaks therersquos salt in the cooking process, so put them together and suddenly the wine becomes this juicy drink.rsquoHoyrsquos tip for matching food and wine is simple - lsquothe more flavour you have in your food, the more flavour you should have in your winersquo. He gives the example of a dinner of smoked fish with a cream sauce. lsquoThe sauce is where your fattiness will come through, so you will need a bit of acidity in your wine. If you tried to match a Sauvignon Blanc the flavours of the dish would overpower the wine as it doesnrsquot have a huge amount of flavour necessarily - butyou changed that Sauvignon Blanc into a nice wooded Chardonnay the wine will stand up to the food and still have the acidity.rsquoWith something like a green salad, though, a wooded Chardonnay would kill the delicate summery taste, but a Sauvignon Blanc is probably perfect. The worst food and wine matching, says Hoy, is red wine with dessert. The clash of sugar and tannin is frankly disgusting - so what you need is a desert wine, something like a Sauterne. lsquoThe wine you are drinking must always be sweeter than the food you are eating,rsquo says Hoy.Hoy wants to remove all the snobbery from wine. Getting the right drink to go with the right food shouldnrsquot be the domain of the middle classes - itrsquos about taste, not money, and we all have taste. Of course, many wines arenrsquot cheap, but over the years low cost wines have filled supermarkets and a half decent red or white can be picked up for the same price as a six pack of beeryou know what you are looking for, and what food will go with it.Jay McInerney, the acclaimed American novelist and wine writer, says having less money will make you a more astute wine drinker as you are lsquoforced to make choices and sacrices that can only sharpenrsquo discrimination and appreciation. lsquoStarting at the top, one will miss out on the climb,rsquo he says.McInerney makes discovering wine sound like a mysterious journey, and indeed there is something deeply mysterious about wine. The film Sideways is adored by wine drinkers as itrsquos a tragi-comic love story wrapped in a homage to the vineyard. In the film, one of characters, Maya, has a speech in which she talks about wine asitrsquos almost human. lsquoI like to think about the le of wine,rsquo she says, lsquohow itrsquos a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing how the sun was shiningit rained. I like to think about all the people who tended and picked the grapes. Andits an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I like how wine continues to evolve, likeI opened a bottle of wine today it would taste dferent thanId opened it on any other day, because a bottle of wine is actually alive. And its constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peakshellip and then it begins its steady, inevitable decline.rsquoFor Hoy, wine is about simplicity. A winemaker in ancient Rome could make as good a wine as the wealthiest and best equipped vineyard owner today. lsquoIrsquove seen people make the most astounding wines in plastic tanks,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoIrsquove worked in some vineyards in France where the equipment was as old as the hills and I thought there was no way you can produce decent wine here, but you taste the wines and theyrsquore remarkable. The very best wines in the world are the ones where the wine-maker is working with what nature has given them - not adding or taking anything away.rsquoThose great wines are down to what the French call lsquoterroirrsquo - the land, the environment in which the grape is grown. The secret is getting the right grape for the right soil and climate. Once that sweet spot - that Goldilocks zone - has been found then nature will take her course.Of course, not everyone is in love with wine. The writer Rory Sutherland finds itrsquos the snobbery that kills. lsquoFor the drinker to demonstrate status and connoisseurship,rsquo he says, wine must become lsquoabsurdly hard to navigate, so providing opportunities for contrived, hair-splitting distinctions that let the buyer advertise his own discernment.rsquoOthers, quite rightly, worry about health effects, like Dr Susan Biali, a wine drinker whorsquos now more or less on the wagon. lsquoI love wine,rsquo she says, but she admits to an addictive personality and recalls the aggressive breast cancer her mother had in her s. When Biali heard the renowned Hard-trained gynaecologist Sara Gottfried say lsquowhat you think wine is giving you, itrsquos actually taking awayrsquo, she decided to quit. lsquoThe truth of this resonated so completely with me that it pushed me over the edge. No more wine, or alcohol, period, except on the rarest occasions like a special dinner.rsquoOthers simply hate wine because of the taste. Author Anne Fadiman is the daughter of the late, great wine critic, Clton Fadiman, but she detests Bordeauxs, Burgundys, Pinot Noirs, and Pinot Grigos. Therersquos not a wine she likes - and thatrsquos because shersquos as near as it comes to a supertaster - someone with a higher than average number of tastebuds who can be overpowered by strong flavours. lsquoAs other women fake orgasms, I have faked hundreds of satisfied responses to hundreds of glasses,rsquo she says.Luckily, for the Glasgow Wine School, supertasters are relatively few and far between - therersquos certainly none at the schoolrsquos latest wine tasting evening. Mike Cottam is leading a dozen or so people - of all ages and backgrounds - through the basics of how to get the best from a glass of wine.Each person is concentrating solely on the most sensory experience for a human outside of sex - taste. As they sip and slurp and swirl it seems asthe mouth is the very centre of their being - and perhaps it is, can you imagine how dead le would be without taste One of the tasters, Alec McLean, says wine is about simple pleasures. lsquoItrsquos about taste,rsquo he says, lsquorelaxation. Itrsquos about being slow in a busy world. Itrsquos also about story - where did the wine come from, who made it, and why. Itrsquos not mass produced, itrsquos real. Thatrsquos a rarity these days.rsquoTASTING TIPS: HOW TO DRINK WINE LIKE A CONNOISSEURIf you want a quick guide on how to taste wine, then Madeline Puckette and Justine Hammack at the company Wine Folly are your go-to connoisseurs.They say follow the four simple steps of look, smell, taste and conclude, and yoursquoll be able to navigate the complex world of wine with ease.LOOKYou can tell a lot just by how a wine looks.Tilt the glass over a white backdrop to inspect the colour. The paler the colour at the edge the younger the wine. In a white, a deep gold will be oaked. The darker the red, the higher the tannin.Swirl the wine to see how viscous it is -the wine lsquolegsrsquoare slow then the alcohol is high. Swirling also oxygenates the wine letting flavour out.SMELLHold the glass just under your nose and give it a quick snf to lsquoprimersquo your nose. Swirl, and then get your nose right in the glass and take a deep snf. Now think about what those smells remind you of - donrsquot be scared to move your nose around in the glass as rich fruit smells and more floral smells can gather in dferent places.If your nose gets lsquooverloadedrsquo snf your forearm to neutralise all those wine smells. Donrsquot wear perfume.In wine, the primary aromas are from the grapes. So a Sauvignon Blanc will smell like gooseberries or grass. Secondary aromas come from the winemaking process, and reactions with yeast and bacteria. So the buttery smell in Chardonnay comes from a type of bacteria. Tertiary aromas are from the ageing process - thatrsquos what gives Champagne its nutty flavour.TASTECoat your mouth with a large sip followed by smaller sips. Sloosh it around in your mouth and draw air in through your teeth. Try to pick out at least three fruit flavours and three other flavours. You donrsquot need to spit wine out.Think about the basic tastes of wine. Sweetness is at the front of the mouth. Acidity makes your mouth water. Tannin dries the mouth - the Wine Folly folk say itrsquos like a lsquowet teabagrsquo. Alcohol creates heat at the back of the mouth.Wine lsquoevolvesrsquo on your palate. A Syrah, for example, tastes very strong for a short period of time. A Cabernet Sauvignon builds on the palette and then fades gradually. A Pinot Noir is subtle, never overpowering the mouth and has a long finish - meaning the taste lingers over time.CONCLUDEThis is where you begin to build your expertise. Was the wine balanced  Did one flavour overpower another Think about the key traits of the wine and keep them in your memory to use when tasting other wines.Try blind tasting with friends - and see how you all react to each wine.Start with single-ietals - thatrsquos one type of grape such as a Chardonnay or a Merlot - so you can work out how each grape tastes.Try the same grape but from dferent regions - like France, Chile or New Zealand.Be honest - decide what type of wine you like, not what type of wine you are told you should like.Wine Folly use a four point rating system - from bleh, to meh, then yeah, and finally last meal, as in this is the wine yoursquod have with your last meal on earth.Drink sensibly."},{"url":null,"title":"experts-call-on-snp-government-to-back-5-child-benefit-rise-in-budget","story":"The experts issued their demand days after a new report revealed that nearly a quarter of a million children north of the border are in poverty.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard backed the call: \"Children living in poverty cannot wait several years for these additional funds - they need them now.\"Following the independence referendum, the cross-party Smith Commission led to Holyrood acquiring new powers over taxation and social security.Among the basket of powers given to MSPs was the ability to create new benefits and top-up existing programmes reserved to Westminster.The SNP Government has since confirmed it will introduce an income supplement by , although Ministers have yet to decide on what form it will take.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, around one million Scots are in poverty, of which , are children.In two separate letters, a range of senior figures have called on the Government to bring forward their top-up plan by announcing an income boost in Wednesdayrsquos Budget.Their preferred option is to increase child benefit, which is currently set at pound. a week for the first child, by pound, in line with the high-profile lsquoGive Me Fiversquo campaign.In their letter to Mackay, four senior church figures - Church of Scotland Moderator Rt Rev Susan Brown, The Most Rev Mark Strange of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Joan Cook of the Scottish Unitarian Association, and Bishop William Nolan - wrote:ldquoThere is a compelling argument to act with greater urgency in implementing the income supplement. Given the levels of poverty that currently exist in Scotland, we urge you to consider using the budget to deliver the income supplement in the next year, rather than by the current timescale of .ldquoDoing so would reflect the great need that families across Scotland must be lted out of poverty right now, rather than in several yearsrsquo time.\"They added: ldquoAs supporters of the Give Me Five campaign, we ask that ndash as well as bringing forward the delivery of the supplement ndash you also consider doing so via topping up child benefit, which would immediately lt tens of thousands of children out of poverty.In the second letter to the Finance Secretary, over twenty prominent iniduals called for child benefit to be increased.These include Satwat Rehman at One Parent Families Scotland, Children st Chief Executive Mary Glasgow, Scottish Drugs Forum CEO David Liddell, STUC General Secretary Grahame Smith, Poverty Alliance Director Peter Kelly and Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland Director John Dickie.It also included senior figures in Cranhill Development Trust, childrenrsquos charity Aberlour, Justice and Peace Scotland, Energy Action Scotland, Close the Gap and Engender.They wrote: ldquoAs a non-means tested entitlement, it [child benefit] has a high take-up rate and is less expensive to administer, and we continue to believe that topping up child benefit would represent a most effective and impactful way of delivering the new income supplement.The signatories also stated that they are ldquoseriously concerned that the  timescale for an income top up is ldquonot reflective of the urgency with which it is required.Dickie said: ldquoThese letters demonstrate the extraordinary breadth and depth of support across Scotland for an immediate boost to family incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing.ldquoAlong with faith groups, trade unions and childrens charities we urge the Finance Secretary to prioritise financial support for families as a matter of urgency. A pound top up to child benefit would be one way of lting thousands of children out of poverty and protecting many more from the damage poverty wreaks.The SNP has so far resisted the policy on the grounds that the payment would benefit families not in poverty.SNP Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ldquoScotland is the only part of the UK to have ambitious targets to reduce, and ultimately eradicate, child poverty. We are developing a new income supplement to provide additional financial support to families who need it most as research shows that topping up Child Benefit, which remains reserved to the UK Government, is not the most efficient or effective way to lt children out of poverty, nor would it be quick or simple.However, the Government is facingpolitical pressure to back the pound a week increase, as the Greens and Scottish Labour are in favour of the move.Leonard said: \"This is a hugely signicant intervention in the budget debate by faith leaders, charities, anti-poverty campaigns and the STUC uniting to call for Scotlands powers to be used in the interests of the many, not the few.\"Derek Mackay must listen to these church leaders, charities and Labour and raise Child Benefit by pound per week in his budget on Wednesday.\"This would lt around , children out of poverty and help families across Scotland.\"Scottish Greens MSP Alison Johnstone said: \"Topping up Child Benefit was a Green manesto proposal that would lt thousands of families out of poverty.

MPs now know that stopping Brexit altogether is an option open to them before the end of the Article  period.\"Parliament can now back a Peoplersquos Vote in the knowledge that a remain outcome could be acted on unilaterally, should that be what people decide.\"The judgement vindicates the cross-party effort to establish the legal position and shames the UK Government, which has spent a small fortune trying to keep Parliament in the dark.Mr Smith called the ruling \"dynamite\" and said Scots had delivereda \"way out of Brexit\".He said: \"Bringing the case was a risk but it has worked better than we could have hoped for.ldquoOur case has confirmed, once and for all and from the highest court in the business, that the UK can indeed change its mind on Brexit and revoke Article , unilaterally.\"The timing is sublime.

I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings. However, more recently windows on the higher first floor were also damaged. Vandalism of council property is a complete waste of council tax payers money as it erts council staff away from delivering the essential services that are required.\"Monday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118245.jpg","title":"Thurso musician sets tone for blockbuster","story":"A THURSO-born composer has taken a step back into medieval Scotland to create a unique score for a new multimillion-pound film about Robert the Bruce.Jim Sutherland, an award-winning composer who leads the eclectic mix of musicians that form La Banda Europa, created the \"diegetic soundtrack\" for Outlaw King which is launched globally on Netflix from next Friday.\"The diegetic soundtrack relates to all the sounds and background music playing in a scene and not the principal soundtrack,\" said Jim, who now lives in Auchtermuchty.For the job he did extensive research into what kind of music would be played by musicians in medieval Scotland and England.\"There is the music from the troubadours, minstrels and the ordinary people who sang songs of the time but there is very little evidence of what this was actually like.\"You have to make assumptions for a lot of it but I used as much evidence as I could from songs and music that were going on in Europe at that time.\"Diegetic music is part of the fictional setting and will be the music playing in a scene, such as from a minstrel who may be in shot, that will be heard by the characters on screen at that moment. Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Monday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118675.jpg","title":"Xmas hampers with a little muscle tow","story":"GYM owner Kris Hamilton will be flexing his biceps ahead of his annual sleigh pull from Thurso to Wick.Every year, Kris puts on his Santa Claus outfit and takes the role of the reindeer as he pulls a sleighful of hampers between the two towns.The hampers ndash which will be towed by Kris on December  ndash will be packed full of food, drink and clothing, and delivered to the elderly and some of the most vulnerable residents of Caithness.Its Kriss fth year at the helm, and while many applaud his fine efforts ndash the hampers being delivered to the east Caithness offices of NHS Highlands Care at Home services ndash they may well wonder why he takes on such an arduous task.Kris ndash who runs the Hamilton Optimum Training gym at Ackergill ndash says his motivation is clear.\"One moment of my pain could be a letime of happiness for somebody ,\" he says.\"Im effectively taking the role of the reindeer by pulling this sleigh ndash theyve got time off ahead of their main job on Christmas Eve ndash but its worth the effort.\"He stresses that at least hes got a sturdy sleigh to haul his good this year.\"The first year I did this I went from Thurso to Wick pulling a Tesco trolley full of goodies,\" he said.\"That was quite something as trolleys can be tricky to control in the shop let alone on the road.\"He underlined that the episode served as a good advertisement for Tesco, as it showed how strong its trolleys are.\"We average around  hampers ndash although were aiming for  ndash and were appealing for people to gather and donate as much food, drink and clothing as possible, as it can really light up someone less fortunates Christmas.\"If people are in a position to give, then they can donate what they can to myself at the gym in Ackergill.\"Kris is no stranger to fundraising as earlier this year he got down and dirty as he battled \"the Beast\".He added: \"The Beast Race is an annual km obstacle course race set around the banks of Loch Ness.\"The obstacles being mud, hills, marshes and climbing walls.

It has been a gradual build-up over the years but I think the way the Highland Council has been dealing with issues has not helped and it has not helped any of you whatsoever.Mrs Manson promised a ldquolistening council when she took the reins from Steve Barron last month. That has included a y series of drop-ins across the sprawling Highland Council area inviting people to share what they feel the local authority does well and where therersquos room for improvement.The council faces a massive budget gap against a backdrop of simmering public discontent over areduction in services as belts are tightened.She said she was willing to look at all issues raised. She said: ldquoI need to think about how we structure staff in the council so that people feel there is an equal service out there.The planned introduction of parking charges to a town which boasts freely available space prompted warnings. Councillor Margaret Paterson said: ldquoI can tell you that the majority of people in Dingwall want you to stop imposing parking charges. And as a council you donrsquot care how the High Street will go down the plug hole because of it.Mrs Manson said she would consider the concerns raised during the drop-ins and would report back in January.What do YOU think  We welcome feedback.

What do my constituents, or at least the majority of them, feel I should do The atmosphere at Westminster has at times been what is best described as ‘febrile’. Much more experienced colleagues tell me they have known nothing like it.Since the start of the week, however, and three straight defeats for the Government, it’s probably been much more about mutual, cross-party team spirit and comparing notes.Team spirit may seem like an odd phrase to use about a place much more used to tribalism. But that is exactly what has been happening.I’ve had snatched conversations with colleagues from other parties, sharing our confidence that we might still be able to pause this economic disaster long enough to give the people the chance to have their say. A final say. A people’s vote.: Hard Brexit makes these people fear for their lives – Christine JardineBut, and I shall come back to this later, I have also spent hours reading the hundreds of emails, letters and postcards that I’ve been sent by constituents eager for me to know their views.I appreciate that many of you will be worried that a referendum on the deal could create yet more isiveness. But, at this point, with parliament in gridlock and no majority for any deal, going back to the people might just be the best option. By far.Our five days of debate in the Commons have, so far, been long, tiring and, at times surprising. There is no cohesion on the Government benches.A Tory rising to their feet is as likely to be criticising their own party for either falling short on delivering Brexit or for ignoring the national interest as they are to be attacking the opposition. Even the Cabinet is unpredictable.And for each of us inidually, there is the thought that this is a decision we cannot afford to get wrong. The country cannot afford for us to get it wrong.Which brings me back to the correspondence I have had from my constituents.I take the privilege of representing the people of Edinburgh West more seriously than any role I have ever had, outside parenting.And for me that has meant taking every opportunity to check that their views have not changed since the referendum on  June, .On that night, I left the count at Meadowbank with the figures ringing in my ears. More than  per cent of the voters in Edinburgh wanted to stay in the European Union. The support in Edinburgh West was among the highest in the country.: Refugees like young Alan Kurdi are still dying in the Med – Christine JardineNow,  months later, I have little reason to doubt the solidarity of that opinion.Out canvassing, I have listened carefully to what both myself and my colleagues have been told on the doorsteps.I have kept a careful log of what those who have written to me have had to say.I also have my own reasons, of course, for thinking our national interest is not well served by the current proposals.I do not think this, or any deal, can deliver the continued economic stability we have in the European Union. Our industries and businesses need an end to the uncertainty.Even the Chancellor Philip Hammond said recently that we will not be as well off economically outside of the EU.I have also argued consistently that the people should have the final say and that is now, I believe, even more pertinent.The issue of Northern Ireland, the problems created for a still-fragile peace process and the fact that the Government seems content to let them drt away from the UK in this agreement has also been a factor.And then there are my constituents. Their future and their views.Of the several hundred who have taken the time to share their views with me, more than  per cent want me to vote against this deal.That,you believe in representative democracy, is a strong argument.The people who elected me, to whom I will answer at the next election, do not like what this Government has presented as our future.If all the other arguments were put aside that would still be enough to persuade me of what I should do.So tomorrow night, I expect to go through the lobbies to vote down the proposals for our departure from the European Union.I shall hold fast to my promise last year to the people of Edinburgh West and keep faith with all of those who are looking now to Westminster to sort this mess and then give them the final say.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841538.1544428934!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith voting down may s brexit plan is about more than the backstop","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...There is far more to worry about in the Prime Minister#s plans than just Northern Ireland, writes Brian MonteithIt does look likely that the vote on the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement will go ahead tomorrow and will be heavily defeated.There is a large exercise in expectation management emanating from Downing Street, with the possible scale of a defeat being talked up so thatit happens to be less than a hundred it can then be portrayed as not as bad as it might have been and this will justy Theresa May carrying on to try and get some concessions from the EU.This behaviour should not be acceptable to anyone who supports democracy.The Withdrawal Agreement is completely and utterly owned by Theresa May. She has told everyone it is her deal or no deal – or even no Brexit. She has sought to rely on the votes of Labour MPs – providing briefings for key Labour MPs ahead of those from her own party. Accordingly the deal has undergone close detailed scrutiny and been found wanting. Some of the legal advice that the Government then chose to ignore has exposed the deal’s real weaknesses – which, crucially, are far more than the Irish Protocol known as the backstop.Of real concern must also be the failure of Theresa May’s government to show that it has made a serious effort to prepare for No Deal. Those two counts – losing a vote over her flagship policy and leaving the country ill-prepared to face an economic risk – are capital offences that would normally warrant removal from office. It should be remembered that in  the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain actually won a vote of confidence following the failure of the Norwegian campaign yet he knew he no longer had moral or political authority and resigned with dignity. Theresa May must also resign to maintain any degree of political respect, andshe does not she should be subject to a vote of confidence within her parliamentary party, for that is the only way to replace her with someone who can get down to the task of preparing the country for leaving without a deal while trying to get the EU to compromise.A vote of no confidence put forward by Labour would most likely fail, as the DUP would not wish to bring down the governing party in favour of Jeremy Corbyn – and recalcitrant Tory MPs would also fall into line rather than be responsible for the fall of the government and the calling of an early general election. So it must be down to backbenchers to submit their letters to trigger the Conservative Party’s own procedures. At that point I would expect the likes of Jeremy Hunt and Savid Javid to tell the Prime Minister it was time to step aside or face humiliation from her own colleagues.There is much talk for May being given one last chance in Brussels this week and thatshe can get a time limit on the Irish Protocol or other such fix that allows the UK to claim a minor victory then her deal could then pass. This would be a foolish and dangerous approach, for even without the backstop the deal is not Brexit. It would still tie the UK into many Single Market rules overseen by the European Courts of Justice and throw away £ billion for nothing in . Countries like South Korea and Canada make no contribution to access the EU’s markets and the House of Lords found there was no obligation to pay the EU £bn.A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure to meet, Simon Boyd, the Scottish CEO of Reid Steel. Simon, who served his apprenticeship in a Clyde shipyard, explained to me how the company he runs, which exports to some  countries around the world, was originally established in France in  – but is now located in Dorset. Yet despite this pedigree and the existence of the so-called Single Market he finds it easier to export steel to Mongolia than he does to France. He gave me two examples of why the first was when his company had a UK Government contract to build storage facilities at Calais, and the second was for a £.M aircraft hangar in Toulouse – but Reid Steel could not do either because it is not a French company. In France only French companies can buy the insurances needed to work in their country. Those insurances also require that all materials have been approved by the French testing authorities, making it more dficult for UK manufactured goods.Far from creating a level playing field like the single market Scotland enjoys across the whole of the United Kingdom, the EU has rigged the game rampant protectionism is the only winner – and this state of affairs is what the Withdrawal Agreement seeks to maintain.Boyd also explained to me how the EU’s Eurocodes system for design unormity ensures each dferent country, and in some cases dferent regions, have their own local ‘annexes’ or conditions. Often they are in native languages and are simply a means to tie up competition in a tangle of prohibitive and costly red tape. Businesses have to purchase Eurocodes from the British Standards Institute, which is a signicant overhead and can be a barrier to entry for many SMEs. To purchase just one part of the Eurocodes for Reid Steel’s type of work costs circa £,, and that is for just one of the  parts of the codes that relate to their industry. For an SME like Reid Steel these overheads are burdensome,not completely unaffordable.As a further example Boyd told me of how Reid Steel designed and helped build  structures in the Caribbean, all designed to British Standards . Every single one stood up to the category five hurricanes last year. Boyd doubted Reid Steel would have been able to win that work using Eurocodes as the use of Eurocodes internationally is rare.The UK needs to be free from the EU’s bureaucratic restraints of the Single Market, Customs Union and the jurisdiction of the ECJcompanies like Reid Steel are to maintain their global reach and grow. The Withdrawal Agreement is a bad deal – with or without the Backstop – and on Tuesday MPs need to take the brave pills and defeat it to ensure a real Brexit can be delivered by setting up the chance for a better deal.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841080.1544204453!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment mps face a test of common sense on brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...In the foreign country of early , those campaigning in favour of the United Kingdom#s departure from the European Union spoke confidently about how painless the process would be. There was no downside to Brexit, they said, only idend after idend.Along with outlandish claims about funding for the NHS, and simplistic slogans about “taking back control”, Brexiteers insisted the UK’s former partners in the EU would bend over backwards to agree a deal that was good for Britain. Two and a half years after the UK voted by a small margin in favour of Brexit, the words of Eurosceptic campaigners ring hollow.The EU, unsurprisingly, has put the interests of its remaining members before those of the UK during y and often fractious negotiations.Every step of the way, as Prime Minister Theresa May has tried to reach a workable agreement with the EU, pro-Brexit campaigners have complained they are not getting what they want. Ask them precisely what that is, however, and they revert to their default setting of talking about sovereigntyand insist thatonly the Prime Minister was bolder, she would have achieved something better.Such is the degree of unhappiness with her draft agreement among MPs - on both sides of the EU debate - that the Prime Minister looks likely to lose the Commons vote on it tomorrow.In normal circumstances, such a defeat would be career-ending. Mrs May assumed power in  pledging to deliver a Brexit that worked for all. She has, it is clear, failed in that task.Boris Johnson has said the Prime Minister could hold on to her job after defeat tomorrow but would have toto Brussels to negotiate a better deal. With precisely the degree of respect due to Mr Johnson, we are bound to say that is nonsensical. The idea that EU leaders will now bend signicantly further to accommodate have-cake-and-eat-it Leavers like Mr Johnson is preposterous.The priority now - for all MPs - must be to avoid a No-Deal Brexit, which represents the worst possible outcome. Whether the quiet pragmatism and level-headedness required to avoid this scenario exists in sufficient supply in the House of Commons remains to be seen. We fear common sense may yet lose the day.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841571.1544428298!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch norway plus is not an option for the uk s brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Amber Rudd and her colleagues are deluding themselves with their Brexit plan B, writes Lesley RiddochScots stand today, surveying the collapse of British governance, like folk on leboats watching the mighty Titanic start to slip beneath the waves.Most of us do not vote Conservative and never will. Most of us voted to Remain in the EU in . And now most of us would opt for independence in the EUa self-harming Brexit goes ahead. And no matter which withdrawal deal is advocated by desperate members of both main political parties south of the Border, each one is more damaging than simply staying in the EU. That includes Amber Rudd’s crazy, last gasp advocacy of “Norway-plus” as a Brexit option,or really when Theresa May’s dead duck is finally allowed to waddle off the stage. Of course, on the face of it, Norway-plus looks inviting. The UK was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Associationin . Britain left to join the EEC in , so EFTA membership could be portrayed as ato the fold we should never have left. Rejoining EFTA would let the UK remain inside the European single market by also gaining eligibility to join the European Economic Areaand that would guarantee genuinely frictionless trade.Britain would leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the common agricultural and fisheries policies and be free of the drive towards “ever closer union” from the end of . And the “plus” bit – remaining in a temporary customs union – would allow goods to join services enjoying business asnormal instead of the impending chaos of a no-deal Brexit.But the price is high, especially for a party which consciously decided to follow the irresponsible and malicious path of blaming Brussels, EU nationals and immigrants for the Dickensian levels of poverty, inequality, starvation, collapse of public services and general hopelessness created by their own policies in Britain. There is therefore no way the Tories can sell a Norway-plus deal which accepts freedom of movement and “rule-taking” from Brussels while paying - per cent of full membership fees to feverishly Brexit-ready English voters. Of course, there’s another tiny problem with the Norway-plus option. Norway will block it.Last week, Heidi Nordby Lunde, Conservative MP and president of Norway’s European Movement, kicked British membership of the EFTA roundly into touch, telling Channel : “I’m sceptic to letting the UK into the EFTA family because it’s kind of like having an abusive partner spiking the drinks and inviting them to the Christmas party.”When askedshe felt that the potential of Britain joining the EFTA would upset the balance in that group, she added: “I think you would mess it all up for us, the way you have messed it up for yourselves.”This kind of reality check has so far been completely missing from Britain’s pie-in-the-sky Brexit debate and is all the more signicant because Norwegians are usually the world’s most diplomatic people – the product of compromise and consensus that comes from almost a century using PR in elections.But Lunde summed up Britain’s Norway-plus problems succinctly: “The Norway deal has four issues that I don’t think UK politicians want. First of all, we accept migration internally in the EU, we also accept rulings by the European Court of Justice, we accept the rules and regulations that we get from the EU. Also, being in the EFTA bloc, we can’t make our own free trade agreements without having Liechtenstein and Iceland with us.”Interestingly, none of these obstacles for “red line” Britain would create an insuperable barrier to an independent Scotland which wanted to pursue the EFTA EEA routeEFTA members and Scots decided that was preferable to full EU membership. But after this one short interview on Friday, Norway-plus stood roundly demolished as an option for Britain. Yet, unbelievably, the very next day, flying in the face of all that had just been said, Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to publicly back the Norway-plus modelMay’s Brexit deal is defeated in the Commons tomorrow. Even more incredibly, Rudd’s desperate advocacy of this non-viable Norway deal propelled the Work and Pensions Secretary back up the pollsters’ rankings in the race to become the next Tory leader. Mind you, since the attempt to keep legal advice from MPs also shunted Attorney General Geoffrey Cox into the running, why should anyone be surprised  Despite defeat in the Commons, Tory MPs and London-based political commentators were apparently moved and impressed by the gravelly, authoritative quality of his voice. These are the depths to which “leadership” in British politics has sunk.In short, a proposal that was comprehensively trashed only  hours earlier by a Norwegian Conservative politician has earned the deluded or deliberately obfuscating Rudd an even greater chance of taking over when May has gone.If folk believe this bourach can still be described as governance, they must be part of the minority – according to weekend surveys of Scottish public opinion – that still prefers Brexit in the UK to Scottish independence in Europe. You don’t have to be a card-carrying Christian for a verse of Matthew to come to mind: “Beware of  prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them.”Well, now all Scots know how the Conservative Party and the British Government choose to operate. They are always focused on the short term, always seeking one-off deals instead of long-term relationships, always feathering their own nests – recent European investments by leading Brexiteers haven’t escaped public attention – and always suspicious or careless of neighbours’ interests. It’ll be a very long time before the Irish forget Priti Patel’s appalling suggestion that the prospect of food shortages should be used to scare Irish people into submission over the backstop. Of course, Scots are not immune from Brexit or its ill effects.But looked at from the perspective of those boarding the leboat north of the Border today, there’s only one question left as Britain embarks on its final act of jaw-dropping self-harm.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong .."},{"url":null,"title":"review kansa impress at mareel album launch ","story":".from their new album an early highlight of the set., an ode to making the most of the time you have, proved an audience favourite also.Huddled tight together in a semi-circle at the front of the Mareel stage, Kansa appeared in a number of dferent guises throughout the night, with fiddlers Lynda Anderson and Lois Nicol swapping sporadically.After the interval, former Kansa member Stewart Grains provided the audience with a mixture of reels and Christmas classics with the accompaniment of Kirsten Hendry on piano. reduced some audience members to tears.The night belonged to Kansa though, and theirto the stage for the end of the concert was greatly appreciated by the full audience.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death.

We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8726164.1543838961!/image/image.jpg","title":"five fun festive events for the whole family this christmas","story":"With so much to see and do this festive season, it can be hard to decide what to prioritise.

All we do know is that she shall be like Him for she shall see Him as He really is and all He really is, is love.What can we hope to achieve in le except to have made this world a better place for our having been in it And Caoilte has made this world a better place. She has brought love and faith and spurred our hope.”Following Requiem Mass, Caoilte was laid to rest in Carnmoney Cemetery."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"community change makers combating malnutrition","story":"Concern Worldwide’s Darren Vaughan visited Burundi to see how funding fromFood in a Fragile World appeal – supported by the North Belfast News – is making a dference to tens of thousands of children facing hunger“She’s energetic and bouncing with le,” says -year-old mum Clotilde Ndayisenga as she attempts to squeeze a hug from her second youngest daughter, Ines.The five-year-old finds it dficult to stay still for a moment as we sit on a bench outside the two-room family home in a rural village in Rugombo. The draw of playing with her friends a few metres away is just too much for her.“She loves to be involved in everything,# says Clotilde, #especially helping to prepare food and cook. She#s quick to learn.#The proud mum of four is thankful that Ines and her other children are growing up strong and healthy. She puts it down to a combination of a ied and nutritious diet and the help and advice of community-based health workers, carers and volunteers supported by international development charity Concern Worldwide.Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, where more than a third of the population don’t have enough food to eat. Poverty, political instability and scarce rainfall all contribute to high levels of food insecurity and hunger. And children, who make up around half the population, are disproportionately affected.What makes it even more of a challenge is that Clotilde and her family live in Cibitoke – an area with one of the highest levels of chronic malnutrition in the country. Every other child living there is chronically malnourished.Hunger prevents them from developing. It causes stunting and weakens their immune systems making them more susceptible to diseases. Their ability to grow and learn is permanently damaged. By the time they are two-years-old, the effects of chronic malnutrition are irreversible.The overall level of acute malnutrition in the area is also poor, with one in every  children moderately or severely malnourished. Last year, the UN estimated that as many as . million children in Burundi were impacted, with almost , under-fives requiring treatment for severe malnutrition.It is for that reason that aid agencies like Concern are targeting pregnant women, and mums with young children. The aim is to prevent malnutrition in the first place or spot the early signs before it takes hold.A few kilometres away, we meet another -year-old mum, Charlotte Nzeyimana. She has been walking for almost two hours carrying baby Keddy on her back and with four-year-old daughter Kyntia by her side.In the shade of a banana grove, Charlotte shares her concerns about young Kyntia, who sits motionless on the ground beside her. “My daughter is not very healthy,” she says.Seven months ago little Kyntia was diagnosed with oedema – a symptom of severe acute malnutrition. She was admitted to hospital and recovered after a month. But her situation remains precarious.“I breastfed her until she was three-years-old,# says Charlotte. #After that, she began to get sick. She has never had a ied diet – and has only ever eaten cassava paste.#In the next few weeks, though, Charlotte will begin to reap the benefits of the same vital health and nutrition advice and support that Clotilde enjoys.The programme, which started in July, is run by Concern with funding from the UK government. Last year, as part of the overseas charity’s Food in a Fragile World appeal, the public donated just over £, which was matched pound-for-pound by the government. That matched funding is now being used in this part of Burundi to help improve the lives of more than , under-fives at risk of malnutrition.At the heart of Concern#s efforts to tackle hunger is a team of  skilled Community Health Workers . They are trained to detect the early signs of malnutrition on the spot and treat certain illnesses and infections. Concern also supports , Care Group Volunteers and  Mother Leaders who promote breastfeeding and good nutrition, food preparation and hygiene practices.#We rely on our Community Health Worker,# says Clotilde. #She has treated my children for malaria and diarrhoea. Andthey fall sick again, she will know what to do.#Both Clotilde and her husband earn what they can from casual work cultivating cassava and corn. Between harvests and during lean times they sell eggs, buns, soap and home-made banana juice to friends and neighbours. It is enough for them to survive on.#The CHW has told us the importance of having a balanced diet,” she says. “We eat twice a day – mostly beans, corn, rice, cassava paste, sweet potatoes and vegetables.”On a steep hillside in Bukinanyana not far from where we met Charlotte, Community Health Worker Jeannette Icimanishatse is greeted by shouts and laughter. The -year-old grandmother is visiting one of ten households on her weekly rounds. It is clear that she has gained the trust and respect of her neighbours, encouraging them to take simple preventative measures to positively impact their children’s lives.“I am proud of what I do,” says Jeanette. “Mums depend on us for help. It is rewarding to know that we are doing something to make the le of the community better.”Community Health Workers like Jeannette refer any cases of severe acute malnutrition to the local health centre for specialist treatment. They even help to arrange transport and encourage mums to save a little for emergencies. Mothers whose children are moderately malnourished are enrolled in community-based nutrition demonstrations where they receive advice on key feeding and care practices. They are also given support to build a kitchen garden which enables them to have vegetables all year round, and an opportunity to be part of a savings and loans scheme.It is a highly effective approach, according to Sebastien Sebahizi, Concern’s Health and Nutrition Programme Manager in Cibitoke, because it focuses on behaviour change and peer-to-peer communication.“What we have observed,” he says, “is that some mothers in exactly the same living conditions have children who are healthy. We bring them into the programme as Mother Leaders and Care Group Volunteers, so that mums who are struggling can spend time with them and see how it’s done.”A further spin-off from tackling malnutrition at grassroots level is that less of a strain is placed on the therapeutic and stabilisation services provided by local clinics.“What we hope to achieve,” says Sebastien, “is to halve the number of childhood nutrition-related consultations in local health centres. That will ease the pressure on the system and enable medical staff to deal with more complicated cases.“But ultimately, our goal is to reduce childhood malnutrition and give more young children the opportunity to grow up healthy and well. It is something each one of them deserves.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcgurks first uvf target searched 48 hours","story":"THE bar that the UVF had intended to blow up before switching their sights to McGurk’s had been raided two nights earlier by the British army and patrons arrested and screened.Fteen civilians, including two children, were killed in the North Queen Street bar massacre on December  .Ciarán MacAirt, a grandson of two of the victims, unearthed the informationin secret military documents in the National Archives in London. This week marks the th anniversary of the atrocity.At pm on December ,  – two days before the McGurk’s attack, British soldiers of the nd Battalion Royal Regiment Fusiliersraided and searched the Gem Bar close to McGurk’s Bar on North Queen Street.Less than  hours later, loyalist paramilitaries of the Ulster Volunteer Forcetargeted the Gem Bar for a major bomb attack. The Gem Bar was suspected by the British Army of being frequented by members of the Official IRA.The one convicted bomber, Robert James Campbell, confessed that the UVF gang drove to the area to attack the Gem Bar.It is believed that they could not plant the bomb there as young men were outside the bar so the bombers drove around the corner and pulled up beside the side entrance of McGurk’s Bar instead. One of the bombers got out of the car and placed the bomb in the entranceway, lit the fuse and ran back to the car which then sped off down Great George’s Street.Ciarán MacAirt said: “It is horric to contemplate that the British Army believed that the Gem Bar was frequented by members and supporters of the Official IRA and had raided the bar, searched it and screened its customers before lting a half dozen men. The action resulting from these lts is redacted in the files. Then, two nights later, pro-state loyalist extremists targeted the Gem Bar but failed to get clear access so made the fateful decision to attack the soft target of McGurk’s Bar instead.“We also know from these files, contrary to what the police and Office of the Police Ombudsman reported to our families, the British Army within an hourhad linked the Gem Bar to the bomb attack as the files record that McGurk’s Bar “was close to the Gem Bar” – but the British Army’s description of the Gem Bar is withheld from the families even after  years after the atrocity.“I believe the redacted information records that the Gem Bar was a ‘Goulding’ bar which in British military parlance denoted its alleged affiliation to the Official IRA whose leader at the time was Cathal Goulding. The reason that it is redacted could be that it shows that the British Army had correctly considered the Gem Bar to have been the target and the bombers loyalists. This alone would undermine the botched investigations our families have endured until now.“We also know from the same file that a British Army bomb expert had reported that the seat of the explosion was clearly in the entranceway and not inside the bar as the police had lied to the public, so the bar was attacked as witnesses had testied. Finally, from this signicant new discovery, we now know for a fact that the British Army’s covert death-squad, the Military Reaction Force, was operating in the area with  RRF who had raided the Gem Bar and we had long suspected that it had facilitated and directed the bombers.”Niall Ó Murchú of Kinnear and Co. Solicitors is legal representative for many of the McGurk’s Bar families. He added: “With every piece of new evidence which a family member had to find, it is becoming increasingly clear that the British army was involved in the planning and targeting of this bomb attack. “To allay all suspicion, we challenge Chief Constable George Hamilton and Police Ombudsman Michael Maguire to retrieve this file and release the information that the British Ministry of Defence is withholding from the families  years later.”"},{"url":null,"title":"karen bradley brexit deal must be passed for uk economy to flourish","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"may to address mps as historic brexit vote is called off","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The backstop must go. Too much time has been wasted. Need a better deal. Disappointed it has taken so long for Prime Minister to listen.”The dramatic developments occurred as the European Court of Justice  ruled that Britain can unilaterally halt the Brexit process by revoking the Article  letter declaring its intention to leave the EU.Mrs May’s hastily-arranged statement is widely expected to confirm that she intends to seek further concessions from Brussels to try to win over rebellious backbenchers.Government minister Nadhim Zahawi said the Prime Minister “has listened to colleagues and will head to Brussels to push back on the backstop.”@theresa_may has listened to colleagues and will head to Brussels to push back on the backstop.— Nadhim ZahawiDecember , But a spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker poured cold water on hopes of a renegotiation.In a press briefing in Brussels, Mina Andreeva said: “As President Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible.“We will not renegotiate – our position has therefore not changed and as far as we are concerned the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on March   .”Irish premier Leo Varadkar ruled out reopening negotiations around the backstop, which is designed to keep the Irish border open following Brexit.The Taoiseach said it was not possible to reopen any aspect of the Withdrawal Agreement without reopening all aspects of it.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused Mrs May of “pathetic cowardice” and urged Labour to table a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, which she said the SNP would support.In a message directed at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Ms Sturgeon said: “If Labour, as official opposition, lodges a motion of no confidence in this incompetent Government tomorrow,  the SNP will support and we can then work together to give people the chance to stop Brexit in another vote.“This shambles can’t go on – so how about it ”So it is confirmed - pathetic cowardice it is from PM. Yet again the interests of the Tory party are a higher priority for her than anything . This can’t go on. https:t.co PdzhZEHd— Nicola SturgeonDecember , Mr Corbyn said the UK no longer had a “ing Government” and called on the PM to switch to his party’s plans for a “jobs-first deal”.“We have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst-of-all-worlds deal was going to be rejected by Parliament because it is damaging for Britain,” said Mr Corbyn.“Instead, she ploughed ahead when she should have gone back to Brussels to renegotiate or called an election so the public could elect a new government that could do so.”A demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, Westminster.Labour MP David Lammy,  a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: “This is an unprecedented and historic humiliation for Theresa May.  This is recognition of what has been clear for months: there is no majority for her miserable Brexit deal in Parliament.“It is impossible to deliver on the  referendum result because it was based on  promises and fantasy. No negotiations in Brussels will change this fact.“Our politics is now well and truly stuck.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"watch pm may address commons on rollercoaster day as brexit vote set to be delayed","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In doing so I will be doing the unionist cause and the business community in NI a massive favour.\"The DUP is sticking to its pledge to oppose Mrs Mays Brexit proposals when it comes to the vote in the House of Commons tomorrow.The partys position piles more pressure on the Prime Minister to amend or abandon her Brexit deal, which has attracted heavy criticism not only from her political opponents, but also from many within her own party.Yesterday Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay insisted that the vote would still go ahead tomorrow amid speculation Mrs May might be forced to delay it in a last-ditch effort to avoid a humiliating defeat.The Prime Minister warned Tory would-be rebels the country would be in \"uncharted waters\"the deal was rejected.\"It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,\" she told the Mail on Sunday. \"We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.\"As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.\"Reports suggested Mrs May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in a bid to win over critics of her plan.The Prime Minister spoke to European Council president Donald Tusk yesterday, although Downing Street insisted it was a routine call ahead of the summit.He said it would be a \"an important week for the fate of Brexit\".Tory MP Will Quince quit as a ministerial aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, while the Sundayreported that another parliamentary private secretary was on the verge of quitting, and Cabinet Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt was considering whether to back the deal or resign.She has not backed Mrs Mays deal yet, but has said she supports the Prime Minister.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood said he would back the deal - but indicated that unless it was passed quickly he might support a second referendum because the original decision to leave may \"no longer represent a reflection of current intent\".Other ministers - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd - have suggested that a Norway-plus deal keeping the UK in the single market and a customs union could be a \"plausible\" alternativeMrs Mays plan is rejected.Any defeat would lead to fresh questions about Mrs Mays political future.Former Work and Pensions secretary Esther McVey said she would give the prospect of standing as leader serious consideration, and suggested that Brexiteers should unite around a single candidate.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News Sophy Ridge On Sunday: \"Ive always said I wouldnt rule it out, but it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in all that speculation when weve got such a big issue up for decision on Tuesday.\"Meanwhile, a Brexit betrayal march led by right-wing activist Tommy Robinson was \"vastly\" outnumbered by counter-demonstrators, opposition organisers said. The English Defence League founder turned-Ukip adviser marched with supporters through London yesterday before addressing a rally beside Parliament Square.Scotland Yard placed restrictions on the march as well as on a counter-demonstration organised by Labour supporters and anti-fascists. Labour grassroots group Momentum said about , turned up to oppose the march, claiming opponents \"vastly\" outnumbered the Ukip-led demonstrators nearly five to one.Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party executive met in Belfast on Saturday, where it unanimously agreed that the withdrawal agreement should be rejected.Party leader Robin Swann MLA said: \"We want a deal, the country wants a deal, but not a deal where the ransom to pay is the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\"Its time to go back to the negotiating table.\""},{"url":null,"title":"university of ulster graduations monday december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"major to honour albert reynolds 25 years after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop. After his try-scoring cameo for the seconds last week, Ross Adair was added to the bench.The first half was a dour affair. Old Wesley scored an early converted try, but the lsquoHinchrsquos blanket defence was able to keep the home side at armrsquosfor the rest of the half andfour penalties from the booming left boot of Peter Nelson kept the visitors in touch.Two well struck penalties from the reliable Rory Stynes gave Old Wesley a narrow - lead at half-time.The arm wrestle continued early in the second half with another exchange of penalties making it - coming up to the hour mark.Ballynahinch were starting to dominate the physical exchanges and were rewarded with a try from replacement Adair as the game moved into the final quarter.He seems to have lost none of his electric pace following hip surgery and the coaching staff will hope to ease him back into the starting line-up as he gets more rugby under his belt.The travelling support were spared a nervy finish when front row replacement Campbell Classon went over following a sustained bout of lsquoHinch pressure on the Wesley line.Nelson completed a fine afternoonrsquos work with the boot with the conversion sealing a - victory.The rest of the results in B fell perfectly for the Co Down men and the top five teams are now separated by just two points, with Ballynahinch right in the mix for promotion once again.Old Wesley Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Daisy Lodge receives donation from Amazon Delivery Station  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE charity supporting children and young adults suffering from cancer has received a generous donation from an online delivery company giant.Daisy Lodge welcomed the pound, donation from Amazon Delivery Station and plans to use the donation to provide a child undergoing cancer treatment with short break to Daisy Lodge.Daisy Lodge provides a leline for every young person diagnosed with cancer or living with a parent with the disease during and after treatment so that no family has to face cancer alone.

At the touch of a switch the sun roof and windows open, the seats adjust and the radio aerial goes up and down. The steering is adjustable, the boot opens from a switch on the dash, the lights automatically dip when meeting a car and there is a special lsquoclimate controlrsquo knob. The car also boasts quahonic radio and tapes, a miniature dressing table with lights and a place for a TV.ldquoI was over in England and called in with a friend dealt in American cars. I saw the Cadillac, fancied it and told him I would come back the following week with a view to purchasing it, Jim said.Worth around pound,, Jim reckons it was a real snip and it leaves him in a position to sell his other American car, a  Buick. ldquoComing from the sunshine of state of Florida, there was no rust on it and it was rather frustrating when someone bumped into it after only three weeks on Northern Ireland roads, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick police have warned motorists to lock up their vehicles properly when they go Christmas shopping.The warning comes after recent incidents in the town involving the theft of cars, including one which was taken from a car park at Downtown Shopping Centre.A Ford Cortina car was stolen from Raholp last Wednesday and was later found in a field after crashing through a hedge, while a car was stolen in Market Street and later found in St Patrickrsquos Drive.ldquoA police spokesman said: ldquoThe Christmas period is a time when many cars are stolen.

Most actually attend throughout the course of the year, but quite often it is dferent faces cropping up each month. If only all could come every month, instead of some on occasional months, then we would be a good, strong .The spokesman added: ldquoThere are many issues which can be debated and decisions reached which affect traders and shoppers, so it is hoped that our next meeting will see a revival of interest.NEWCASTLE mdash A petition urging a halt to work on a house in Newcastle was presented to Down councillors at their meeting this week.Signed by  local residents, the petition added fire to Cllr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuersquos claim that the builder had overstepped the restrictions of the original planning permission.After one-and-a-half hours of heated argument the council agreed on a majority decision to ask the planning authority to reconsider the application.Cllr OrsquoDonoghue said the house in King Street was originally given the go-ahead as a two-storey duelling, but had now developed an additional storey. He said the house as being built much higher than it should be and that it was dwarfing the adjacent houses.Cllr Ethel Smyth disagreed strongly with Cllr OrsquoDonoghue and said she felt that the builder was being victimised.KILLOUGH mdash A new pound, housing development in Killough was officially opened last Friday mdash three months ahead of schedule. The development, which consists of  houses, is situated at Castle Street-Main Street on a site which was originally acquired by the old East Down Rural Council.It was eventually transferred to the Housing Executive, but dficulties regarding site boundaries were not resolved until . The existing trees had to be preserved and it was also necessary to preserve the strong street elevation character of the village.The contractor appointed was Polly Brothers, of Downpatrick,and the contractwas  months. However, the contractor has managed to complete the development three months ahead of schedule.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash An exciting new multi-body committee, pledged to crush threats of over-exploitation of Strangford Lough, is expected to be set up within the next three months.The ambitious move is the product of recommendations by a Government working group which was formed two years ago to probe increasing pressures on the lough and surrounding area.The group has concluded that the lough could have massive future potentialit can be preserved in its present unspoilt state. When formed, a management committee will co-ordinate the activities of bodies who have the power to make and implement decisions which influence the future development of the lough.ldquoStrangford Lough is a major resource for the people of Northern Ireland, a spokesman for the Department of Environmentrsquos Conservation Branch said. ldquoIt is indeed fortunate that an area so rich in potential for recreation, tourism and other amenity use, yet so close to a major urbanisation, has remained more or less unspoilt.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh church organist revealed yet another of his musical talents recently when he won the Burnside Cup for top Male Solo Voiceat the youth music festival in Glengormley.Ninegteen year-old Mark Spratt is the organist and choirmaster at First Killyleagh Presbyterian Church and is currently studying music at Stranmillis College in Belfast.This is by no means Markrsquos first success.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery.

Sadly, children are growing up in a society that is saturated with technology and it appears to be hindering their development in reading and understanding.Five Famous Dogs of Ireland brings to le the best loved of all the Irish hounds in history since Finn McCool and his favourite dog, Bran, strolled these parts.They include the much loved best friend of Manus OrsquoKane, an ancient chieftain from the Glens. His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories. This generation is seeing a lot more children who are hyper active but a book in hand can be a slowing down tool to enjoy in a park or curled up on the sofa.Five Famous Dogs of Ireland would make a great Christmas gt for any child or adult.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus.

I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this.

That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people. We have a great staff team and Knockevin has many, many family connections with the area which is so lovely..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Presentation night at Spa Golf Club  ","story":"FINAL closure on Sparsquos  playing season came on Saturday night when Marian Armstrong and Mark Smyth were named the clubrsquos golfers of the year.It was a remarkable achievement for Marian who claimed the title for a fourth time along with the addition of five other trophies she collected at Sparsquos presentation night.Meanwhile, the Spa team captains will soon be knocking on the door of Mark as they make their selections for the  inter-club matches.While this was his first golfer of the year award, he won three other trophies and over the course of the season has seen his handicap plummet from  to the present .Club captain John Robinson said it had been a great year for Spa for many reasons including the achievements of the ious teams.The Pierce Purcell squad reached the final of the competition while the Sam Rutherford and Rossmore teams also won through to the closing games.He thanked everyone for their tremendous support during his year in office including the council, club officers and staff including the green keepers who, he said, had protected and improved Sparsquos most precious asset.Congratulating all the winners, Mr Robinson said the consistent high quality of play meant it was never easy to win a trophy at Spa Golf Club, but to those who achieved their golfing ambitions in  it was a case of ldquovery well done.Lady captain Carol Shields also thanked the large number of club officers and staff who had made her term in office such an enjoyable experience.She said it had been ldquoan absolute pleasure to work with Mr Robinson, describing him as ldquoa perfect gentlemen who has been a great ambassador for Spa Golf Club.Menrsquos prizewinners: Golfer of the Year , Mark Smyth Winter League trophy, Greg Wilson, Tom Wilson and Julian Kelly Gordon Cup, Robert Gartley Sunbound Cup, Barry Stevens Shaw Cup Doubles, Larry Power and Tom Coburn Lowe Cup, John Munn Holmes Cup, Daniel Connolly Scotia Cup, David Corr John Smith Cup , Bobby Wallace and Mandy Murphy Vice-Presidentrsquos cup, Alan Stevens Mark Gibson Trophy, Gordon Martin Montalto Cup, Alan McNamara Boyd Cup, Mark Smyth Ferguson Cup, Larry Power Eric Dodd Cup, Brian McQueen Wallace Cup, Mark Smyth Joe Mulholland Cup, Chris Donaldson La Carte Trophy, David Kidd Sam Graham Cup, Daniel Connolly Action Press Cup, Daniel Connell H L Hegan Cup, Mark Smyth Plessey Cup, James Walker McIlveen Cup, Alan McNamara Caldwell Cup, Eamon Canavan D J Bell Cup, Brian Blythe Eden na Vadie Cup, Brendan McAlarney Summit Trophy, Sammy Gurr Brian Irvine Cup, Gary Simpson Walter Moore Cup, Alan Stevens Dominic Stratton Cup, Brian McGrillen Forthill Cup, Larry Power Spa Cup, Brian Rea Sunday Jug, Barry Stevens.Ladiesrsquo prizewinners: Golfer of the Year, Marian Armstrong Hugh Gordon Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Challenge Cup, Suzanne McLoughlin Caldwell Cup, Mandy Murphy Lindsay Cup, Lynsey Martin Josie Murray Cup, Gillian Earls Kinray Trophy, Beth Coburn Combat Cancer Trophy, Marian Armstrong  Challenge Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas Slieve Croob Cup, Vivienne Abernethy McRoberts Rose Bowl, Pam Trohear Harvest Cup, Catherine McEvoy Plessey Cup, Ellie Smyth Mr Presidentrsquos Cup , Lisa McCavery Victor and Rita Ginesi Cup, Mandy Murphy Sena Feneran Cup, Marian Armstrong Ladiesrsquo Foursomes Matchplay Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas and Carol Shields Howitt Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Montalto Cup, Alex Murphy Adams Aiken Trophy, Stephanie Rea McIlveen Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Hunter Cup, Marian Armstrong Lowe Cup, Gwyneth Cordner McEvoy Cup, Carol Shields Coburn Cup, Marian Armstrong Sarah Brennan Cup, Mandy Murphy Maureen Hanna Trophy, Gwyneth Cordner Lynne Robinson Trophy , Marian Armstrong..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Seaforde machine on target  ","story":"SO close for the Saints in this first round tie as they had the league leaders on the ropes for much of this match, with it only being decided on the final run of games.After last weekrsquos below par performance against the same opposition, the home side battled better in keeping the games tight as Francie McGreevy lost narrowly - to Derek McCann and Des McAuley lost - to David Boal.The next run of games saw another tight away win, this time Graham Christie beating Collie Brown -.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those.

Against the euro, the pound was .% down at ..Mrs May was engaged in a conference call by telephone with her Cabinet ministers as the story broke.There was no official confirmation from  Downing Street that the vote was being called off. But a senior source said: “It’s being pulled.”The dramatic developments occurred as the European Court of Justice ruled that Britain can unilaterally halt the Brexit process by revoking the Article  letter declaring its intention to leave the EU.Mrs May’s hastily-arranged statement is widely expected to confirm that she intends to seek further concessions from Brussels to try to win over rebellious backbenchers.Government minister Nadhim Zahawi said the Prime Minister “has listened to colleagues and will head to Brussels to push back on the backstop.”But a spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker poured cold water on hopes of a renegotiation.In a press briefing in Brussels, Mina Andreeva said: “As President Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible.“We will not renegotiate - our position has therefore not changed and as far as we are concerned the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on March  .”Irish premier Leo Varadkar ruled out reopening negotiations around the backstop, which is designed to keep the Irish border open following Brexit.FOLLOW BREXIT LIVE: SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon appeals to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to put forward motion of no confidence Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Taoiseach said it was not possible to reopen any aspect of the Withdrawal Agreement without reopening all aspects of it.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused Mrs May of “pathetic cowardice” and urged Labour to table a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, which she said the SNP would support.In a message directed at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Ms Sturgeon said: “If Labour, as official opposition, lodges a motion of no confidence in this incompetent Government tomorrow, the SNP will support and we can then work together to give people the chance to stop Brexit in another vote.“This shambles can’t go on - so how about it ”Mr Corbyn said the UK no longer had a “ing Government” and called on the PM to switch to his party’s plans for a “jobs-first deal”.“We have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst-of-all-worlds deal was going to be rejected by Parliament because it is damaging for Britain,” said Mr Corbyn.“Instead, she ploughed ahead when she should have gone back to Brussels to renegotiate or called an election so the public could elect a new government that could do so.”Labour MP David Lammy, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: “This is an unprecedented and historic humiliation for Theresa May. This is recognition of what has been clear for months: there is no majority for her miserable Brexit deal in Parliament.“It is impossible to deliver on the  referendum result because it was based on  promises and fantasy. No negotiations in Brussels will change this fact.“Our politics is now well and truly stuck. The way to unblock it is to go back to the public with a people’s vote, which will either offer a mandate for a specic form of Brexit, or to remain in the EU.”Senior Cabinet Brexiteer Michael Gove told BBC Radio ’s Today that there was “no-one better placed” than Mrs May to get additional concessions in order to provide MPs with “reassurance that this is the right deal”.But he said he was concerned that renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement could lead to other EU countries changing it “in a way that may not necessarily be to our advantage”, adding: “By reopening it, there is a risk that we may not necessarily get everything that we wish for.”As several senior members of the Cabinet were reported to be manoeuvring to replace Mrs May should the vote fail, Mr Gove said it was “extremely unlikely” that he would stand as a future Conservative Party leader.Mrs May’s address to MPs is due to be followed by a statement from Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom setting out the revised timetable for parliamentary business over the coming days.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will then deliver a statement responding to the ECJ ruling on Article .try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealed          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The way to unblock it is to go back to the public with a peoplersquos vote, which will either offer a mandate for a specic form of Brexit, or to remain in the EU.#ECJ: UK is free to unilaterally revoke the notication of its intention to withdraw from the EU ndash Case C-  Wightman #Brexit pic KUOIeQCmdash EU Court of JusticeDecember , Senior Cabinet Brexiteer Michael Gove told BBC Radio rsquos Today that there was ldquono-one better placed than Mrs May to get additional concessions in order to provide MPs with ldquoreassurance that this is the right deal.But he said he was concerned that renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement could lead to other EU countries changing it ldquoin a way that may not necessarily be to our advantage, adding: ldquoBy reopening it, there is a risk that we may not necessarily get everything that we wish for.As several senior members of the Cabinet were reported to be manoeuvring to replace Mrs May should the vote fail, Mr Gove said it was ldquoextremely unlikely that he would stand as a future Conservative Party leader.Mrs Mayrsquos address to MPs is due to be followed by a statement from Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom setting out the revised timetable for parliamentary business over the coming days.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will then deliver a statement responding to the ECJ ruling on Article ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May to address MPs as historic Brexit vote is called off article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Stations are in ying stages of completion and we need time to test the complex railway systems.ldquoThis means that I cannot at this stage commit to an autumn  opening date.ldquoMy team and I are working to establish a robust and deliverable schedule in order to give Londoners a credible plan to open the railway and provide a safe and reliable service.ldquoOnce that work is completed we will then be in a position to confirm a new opening date.Once opened, Crossrail will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, via  miles of new tunnels in central London.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ldquoI havenrsquot hidden my anger and frustration about the Crossrail project being delayed.ldquoThis has a knock-on consequence of signicant additional cost to the project.ldquoIt has been increasingly clear that the previous Crossrail Ltd leadership painted a far too optimistic picture of the projectrsquos status.Elizabeth line services through the central tunnels were due to begin this month, but this was pushed back to autumn.The increasing costs and delayed opening led to the resignation of Sir Terry Morgan from his positions as chairman at Crossrail Ltd and HS Ltd last week.Mr Khan has been summoned to appear at a hearing of the London Assembly Transport Committee next week to explain what he knew and when about the delay.The mayor says he only found out the opening would not take place this month on August , two days before the decision was made public.Sir Terry insists Mr Khan was aware of the problems at least a month beforehand.Mr Khan has ordered the release of minutes from Crossrail Ltd board meetings in the past five years to provide ldquotransparency to Londoners.His office claims they are a ldquoserious indictment of Crossrail Ltdrsquos failed governance and show Mr Khan and TfL were not informed the central section of the project would ldquodefinitely be delayed until August .Crossrailrsquos issues are also heaping further pressure on TfLrsquos finances.The transport authority already has a pound billion operating deficit for this year amid falling passenger numbers, Mr Khanrsquos freeze on single fares and the axing of a pound million annual government grant.It had expected to receive pound million of fare revenue from the Elizabeth line in - alone..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Crossrail steps back from autumn  opening article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
