The prime minister claims the Muslim world has produced “nothing like” the Sistine Chapel, a wonder “beyond the technical accomplishment of Islamic art”. Tell that to Diego Fernandez Castro. In the late 19th century, this Spanish artist created a loving model of the Alhambra palace in Granada that expresses the exact opposite: this glorious medieval Andalusian palace is indeed an Islamic equal of the Sistine Chapel.Castro’s model transfixes you in this exhibition. Delicate patterns of filigree stucco hang in space over slender columns in a theatrical layering of white arches. Brightly coloured tiles are laid out in intricate tessellations within the lighter-than-air galleries. Where the Sistine ceiling depicts creation as a story, the Alhambra expresses the glory of the cosmos in crystalline patterns and systems inspired by the Arab scientific revolution that started in the 8th century – and that also, Boris, provided European artists such as Michelangelo with the optics of perspective.The Alhambra was the last flowering of Islamic art in Spain before it finally fell to the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. Its beauty has seduced westerners ever since – as have the Koutoubia mosque in Marrakech, the Red Gate of Rabat and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, of which admiring depictions by Europeans are in this perspective-shifting exhibition. The image here of the Dome of the Rock was drawn in 1486 in a Renaissance map of the Holy Land. There’s a drawing nearby by Peter Paul Rubens of Ottoman costumes, probably copied from a Turkish album to supply exotic ideas for his sensational paintings of lion hunts and battles. And there’s a portrait sketch by Anthony van Dyck of Sir Robert Sherley in Persian dress with turban, silk cloak and ornate dagger. This isn’t patronising fancy dress. Sherley, an Elizabethan adventurer who went to Persia to make his fortune, was the envoy of Shah Abbas I to the Papal court when Van Dyck drew him in Rome in summer 1622. His costume is authentic.That is the kind of twist that makes Inspired by the East such an important exhibition. It takes one of the most contested and controversial topics around – how the west sees the Islamic world – and offers unexpected insights into a dialogue that’s more complex and affectionate than you may think. Far from being bitter enemies locked in a culture war, the Christian and Muslim worlds, until recent times, looked at each other with mutual fascination. A key document of that entanglement is a 16th-century Venetian portrait of Sultan Bayezid I, in which the Ottoman ruler looks over his shoulder at you, his pensive eye and golden coat caught with a smoky sensitivity influenced by Veronese. This evocative portrait of a historic figure was commissioned in 1578 by the Ottoman vizier through Venice’s ambassador in Istanbul. The Ottoman court got its appetite for Venetian art when Gentile Bellini introduced Renaissance portraiture there. Meanwhile, Venetian painters got their sense of colour partly from the eastern silks and spices on sale at the Rialto.Power attracts. Most Europeans 500 years ago thought it was just a matter of time until the Ottoman empire conquered them. That inspired fear, but also respect. Sultan Bayezid I is portrayed as a godfather figure, both potent and wise. A fantastically wrought Ottoman helmet captured at the second siege of Vienna in 1683 is a relic of the last time the Islamic empire seriously threatened the heart of Europe. The really contentious aspect of this show is what happens afterwards. How did European artists look at Islam in the age of European global domination that became unquestionable by 1800?Lavishly, it turns out. While the west lorded it over a declining Ottoman empire and built colonies in north Africa and Asia, artists including Delacroix, Ingres and a host of lesser known “Orientalist” painters feasted their imaginations on eastern scenes. They researched their subjects in fanatical detail. Was this western interest in the east just a way of claiming to “know” the east in order to rule it? That is the argument of Edward Said’s book Orientalism. My old paperback has an Orientalist painting, The Snake Charmer by Jean-Léon Gérôme, on its cover – a blue-tinged reptilian fantasy of the Other.But that’s a caricature of Gérôme, reveals this show. His 1859 painting The Grain Threshers shows an everyday scene of rural life in Egypt, and offers a new way of understanding why 19th-century European artists painted north Africa. As the industrial revolution sped up, they were drawn to places that seemed to preserve a better way of life. Alphons Leopold Mielich’s The Pottery Seller shows an infectiously busy market Rudolf Weisse’s The Dice Players takes you into the streets of Cairo. These painters are outsiders, looking in with envy.Of course, there’s plenty of sleazy fantasising in Orientalist art. In 1819, Antoine-Ignace Melling drew the grand harem in Istanbul as a vast place, part prison, part hotel. But how realistic is it? Melling made up this western male idea of an eastern harem – yet he also designed a real harem for an Ottoman palace in a case of Orientalism shaping the Orient. In a video that closes the show, Turkish artist İnci Eviner repopulates Melling’s sinister harem with women playing and performing.One thing is undeniable in this exhibition of dreams. However prejudiced we may assume them to have been, westerners from the 15th to 19th centuries sincerely admired the beauty of Islamic art, architecture, crafts and lifestyles. It is only in our own time that Islam’s heritage can be so casually dismissed by pseudo-intellectual politicians and other philistines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a935ec38fdf222a71453f0f66ce7aca81ef793/0_741_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24317936dd86160903da696f6016d591","title":"city of light brassai paris in pictures photography","story":"Called ‘the Eye of Paris’ by his friend the author Henry Miller, the legendary photographer created a striking body of work that documented high – and low – society in Paris between the first and second world wars.

Not so long ago, over dinner with a male colleague, the subject of our salaries came up. He and I work at different organisations, and our skills and responsibilities, though similar, are not precisely the same. Nevertheless, when this man, who is the same age as me and who went to the same university, revealed that he earns twice as much as I do, I was shocked by how I felt. Outwardly, I made a joke of my indignation, demanding that he pay the bill. But inwardly, something inside me faltered: my confidence. Was it possible that this journalist, a man I admire deeply, would now think less of me, knowing that, on paper, I’m worth only half what he is? More to the point, did I now think less of myself? I worried that the answer to both these questions was yes.We tell ourselves that money doesn’t matter. The nature of the work that I do is, and always has been, more important to me than the fatness of my pay slip (and, yes, I know I’m lucky to be able to make this choice). But equality matters too: it is, in fact, everything. In 2017, when the BBC was forced to reveal the salaries of employees who earned more than £150,000, Carrie Gracie, its China editor, discovered that, while her own name was not on this select list, Jon Sopel, the BBC’s North American editor, was paid between £230,000 and £239,000. How did this news make her feel? Naturally, she was angry. Not only had the BBC begged her to take up her job, insisting she was the only suitable candidate she had made pay equality a condition of her acceptance, which meant she had been lied to. But she experienced other feelings, too: a faltering. This was a degradation of her abilities, her experience and her dedication.Gracie’s book about her ultimately successful battle to win pay equality at the BBC isn’t always an entirely gripping read. As she acknowledges, long accounts of grievance hearings, all circumspection and tedious HR-speak are likely to make anyone’s eyes glaze over. Moreover, the fact that she still works for the BBC – having resigned her position as China editor, she is now once again a news presenter – means that she is careful when it comes to venting her feelings about those (mostly men) who so casually belittled her, in ways both big and small. But still, her book is important, and not only for the sound advice it offers to those who may be going through something similar (it is a manual as much as a memoir).Gracie understands all the various ways in which pay inequality can play havoc with a person’s self-belief and peace of mind, and in her book she staples them to the page. It isn’t only that, as a skirmish turns first into a prolonged battle and then into something approaching a war, she is frightened and frequently weary that she hardly knows who among her bosses, if any, she can trust. For me, the most resonant parts of her book have to do with her self worth. “Carrie, it’s always such a joy to see you,” says James Harding, the then director of news at the BBC, when she sees him for a meeting in 2015. “You deliver so much and ask so little.” At the time, she received these words almost gratefully, as women are apt to do. (If people cannot recognise our talent, at least let them salute our efficiency!) Cut to a couple of years later, however, and the BBC is talking of her “growth and development” as if she were some graduate at the beginning of her career, not a woman in her 50s who speaks fluent Mandarin and who knows China inside out.Having to assert the value of her work gets her down. It makes her feel boastful. I understand this and so will many women. But the lesson here is also depressingly obvious. Men are not necessarily going to acknowledge how hard we work themselves, or not in any concrete way, for all that our productivity may be exceedingly useful (“you ask so little”). Some of them, in fact, may be quite determined not to acknowledge it, or even to notice it at all. This is a wilful blindness, and though the law is on our side, there is still, alas, every chance it is reflected in our pay packets (there are ways round the law). My own advice, having read Gracie’s book and having fought some battles of my own, is this: be grateful, but not too grateful. Don’t measure yourself against others, but don’t stop looking around you either. Ask the men questions, and if they don’t – or won’t – answer, ask yourself why.This review is from the Observer• Equal: A Story of Women, Men and Money by Carrie Gracie is published by Virago (£18.99).

Almost half of HKEX’S board is appointed by the Hong Kong government, which has faced pro-democracy protests in recent months that have turned increasingly violent on both sides.HKEX had argued that a deal would bring together the largest financial centres in Asia and Europe and give the LSE’s investors greater access to Asian markets, as the renminbi emerges as a global reserve currency.HKEX already owns the London Metal Exchange, which it purchased in 2012 for £1.4bn, but has so far failed to turn it into a bridge between the west and China."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/002cd48464b5d25664a35af450ba279b6a9bdae5/0_0_2362_1575/master/2362.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a463d080ac5986b32b2478896cbf5ac0 700w","title":"brexit irish border technology","story":"Boris Johnson’s promise of a hi-tech solution is both risible and dismissive.

If Northern Ireland leaves the customs union, there will be border controls.And so May tried to do what Johnson is still proposing: throw money at nerds and hope that they can somehow transform a political problem into a technical issue. The old (superbly condescending) joke was that whenever the Irish question was about to be solved, the Irish would change the question. But the British government has been trying to solve the riddle of Brexit’s Irish question not just by changing the question, but by changing the entire conceptual framework. It has to be removed from a discourse of history and geography and memory and translated into the languages of technology and managerialism.That is how Johnson sought to define the problem in his speech to the Tory party conference last week: “Essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks.” Previously, of course, he suggested that crossing the Irish border was similar to going from one borough of London to another, and that any problem it creates could be solved with the same technology used to operate the city’s congestion charge.This is a way of minimising and dismissing an inconvenient truth. But it also goes to the heart of the complete failure of Johnson’s proposals for a replacement of the backstop designed to keep the border invisible. Everybody in Ireland, north and south, knows that there are many technical questions thrown up by Brexit. But nobody – not even Johnson’s DUP allies – really believes that what Brexit does to John Bull’s Other Island is a matter for a “technical discussion”. In Ireland, it’s about lives – and deaths.Writing about music is said to be like dancing about architecture. Using the language of technology to address the questions of history and belonging on the island of Ireland is geeking about memory – like trying to make an algorithm for grief. It’s a category error that shunts the problem not just into “alternative arrangements” but into a parallel universe.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gets this. When she visited Ireland last April and spent time talking to people who live and work on both sides of the border, she said simply that she understood what they were saying because: “For 34 years I lived behind the iron curtain so I know only too well what it means once borders vanish, once walls fall.” She grasps the truth that what is at stake is not “the exact nature of future customs checks” – it is that customs checks (which the British government pledged never to reinstitute but now proposes to make necessary) are the outward bureaucratic signs of an inner anguish: the rebuilding of spiritual and psychological walls that have been demolished since 1998.Two particular ironies attach to Johnson’s privileging of a technocratic discourse over real human experience. One is that the Brexit project is in every other respect famously contemptuous of “geeks”. The British people, in Michael Gove’s analysis, “have had enough of experts”. But the Irish, apparently, are expected to place all their trust in the experts, nerds and boffins who will come up with magical technologies to create what does not yet exist anywhere on Earth: a frontier between two different customs regimes across which goods move with no controls and no physical infrastructure.The other irony is that Brexit itself is predicated on the idea that a technocratic discourse is entirely inadequate to the task of understanding how people feel about who they are and where they belong. Its bogeymen are faceless bureaucrats in Brussels who can never appreciate the importance of identity and history to the English. Yet the Irish are invited by the very same people to forget history and identity, to just lie back and think of “maximum facilitation”.This creates a dialogue of the deaf. Brexiters’ technofreak obsessions cannot even begin to engage with the memories and anxieties and aspirations that are at the heart of Irish concerns about the collateral damage of the English nationalist project. The disjunction goes so deep that it even involves two different conceptions of time.While Irish people are painfully aware of the past – the deep history that led to the creation of the border and the living memory of the Troubles – the Brexiters act like dedicated futurists. When Johnson told his party, in relation to the border, that “technology is improving the whole time”, he was repeating the sci-fi utopianism that has been central to the Brexit faith: the technology to ensure a frictionless border does not yet exist, but in these days of miracles and wonder it is just over the horizon. The actual “solutions” may be less Silicon Valley, more the IT Crowd, but tomorrow’s world is almost upon us.Until they give up this technological illusion and engage with living history, there is no chance of Johnson and his allies coming up with serious proposals. But why should they do that? The great utility of their discourse lies in its distancing effects. The politicians and special advisers only have to spaff the cash – the geeks can find the answers. Technology – that abstract, shifting, supposedly value-free force – removes the burden of public duty. And the beauty of these machines and systems is that they have no memory, no fears, no hopes and, if it all goes wrong, no possibility of blood on their hands.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the  and author of Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a779e9b3a9078835dc10debb943ab39a7e08b8b8/0_275_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5624b77cbdf484ce60a87fae4da0a8cd","title":"narendra modi bjp india","story":"Modi’s vision for the country is one that stifles dissent and difference, in defiance of its people’s historyFour months have passed since Narendra Modi and the BJP came back to power in India, and more seems to have happened there than in the last 40 years. The sense of severance that many experience today, of being orced from the workings of the nation, exceeds even the helplessness felt during the suspension of civil liberties in the emergency of 1975 to 1977 and the political traumas that followed.This is because – without the matter being explicitly articulated – citizen has been set against citizen: not just Muslim against Hindu or, say, Kashmiris against the rest of India, but those who subscribe to the BJP’s new conception of the nation against those who do not, leaving one without trust in the other.How to judge these past four months? A series of disruptions has dwarfed the now distant seeming upset of Modi’s economically disastrous demonetisation programme of 2016. In August there was the abrogation of article 370 of the Indian constitution, which granted “special status” to Kashmir in acknowledgment of its contested history. This was followed immediately by the “house arrest” of elected Kashmiri leaders and the imprisonment of thousands of others.What we saw was the attempt to take a difficult and isive issue and simply place it to one side by act of will, so that it requires no further discussion. There is the impression that not just the Kashmiris’ but all our fates are now being decided for us. The home minister, Amit Shah, would have us believe that the “restrictions’” in Kashmir are all in the mind. I asked a Kashmiri how she interpreted this. She speculated that what was being implied was that the lack of protest in Kashmir was equal to normalcy. But a lack of protest in a democratic country is strange, and a sustained lack of protest alarming. Is this the normalcy that Indians wish to be bestowed on them by their government?Then there is spectacle of a different sort: of the government borrowing an unprecedented sum of money from the Reserve Bank of India of it failing to pay the Central Reserve Police Force of the economy tanking, of Modi pronouncing that India is in the ascendant. We live simultaneously in disparate realities: a “normal” Kashmir, an abnormal country a bankrupt economy a rising India – competing scripts, none of which acknowledge the existence of the other, as distant as countryman has grown to countryman.If asked what this government’s one great recent achievement is, some people might draw attention to the number of toilets built in a country with poor sanitation. Others, whose experience of the new India is different, would say that its greatest success has been in creating a climate of fear. As a consequence, dissent has a purer form now. It’s no longer, as it was once, preaching to the converted. It’s not even the pointing out of unpleasant facts. It’s simply a demonstration that dissent continues to be possible.India has not, outside of Indira Gandhi’s declaration of emergency, been in this place before, and certainly not with the degree of popular support we see now, which can only be characterised as a form of inebriation. The judiciary, the police and other law enforcement agencies are all seen, rightly or wrongly, to “belong” to the government, and many high-profile lawbreakers seem to be those who, coincidentally, disagree with the BJP. The number of cases of “sedition”, a charge left over from colonial India, has risen dramatically.Of course, the erosion of institutional independence didn’t happen overnight. Over the last 30 years all governments in India, state and central, have had limited respect for civil liberties and democracy: Indian parties are only fervent democrats when they’re in opposition. But no government has been as openly and robustly punitive towards dissent as this one.Could this ferocious and successful discouragement of dissent herald the achhe din (“good times”) Modi has advertised to Indian voters at his rallies? A dissent-free country is a “normal” country a dissent-free political environment constitutes a “good time” for its rulers.I myself have first-hand experience of this. I recently signed a letter of protest addressed to the prime minister, drawing attention to increased religious violence. My co-signatories were 48 of India’s most eminent film-makers, academics, activists, artists and writers. In response to a petition in Muzzafurpur, Bihar, a court has now asked the police to open a case against us.Then there’s the National Register of Citizens (NRC), a central government-backed project in the state of Assam aimed at uncovering and expelling “foreigners” (that is, Muslim refugees from Bangladesh who don’t have the relevant documents, though the reality has turned out to be far messier, though, messily, the majority of those now deemed “foreigners” have turned out to be Hindus). Many are threatened with being uprooted, and others in the region are being asked to help uproot their neighbours. These extraordinary developments got me thinking about ethnicity and citizenship. About the trajectory of Indians in the 20th century: of Gandhi’s relocation to England and then to South Africa, where, made conscious of his race and colour, he first moved towards politics of Sikhs settling en masse in Canada after murderous violence against them in 1984 of Bengalis departing a declining Kolkata in the 70s.Indians are a many-sided people: they are entrepreneurial, curious, cultured, open-minded, adventurous. They have great writers, scientists, businessmen they have Gandhi. They’re also great migrants: they’ve gone to and worked and settled in every part of the world. They know the pain of discrimination and upheaval intimately. In this context, the fraught rhetoric surrounding the NRC, where “illegal migrant” is time and again conflated with “Muslim”, and “Muslim” with “foreigner”, shows a disconnect between what Indians have historically known, felt and achieved as migrants, despite hostility and opposition, and how, at home, they perceive those they suddenly decide are the “other”.It’s odd that our past hasn’t given us a more immediate sense of the value and inevitability of plurality, of accommodating difference. Instead, many of us have refashioned ourselves as north Indian Brahmin manqués, wanting Hindi as the official national language, wanting to be what we’re not, wanting our nation to be what it can’t be. Only a determined abstention from self-inquiry could have got us here. Rather than accepting an India where lack of dissent is expected, it is time to look inward: to recollect the journeys we’ve made, and assess whether we’ve ended up where we wanted to be.• Amit Chaudhuri is professor of contemporary literature at the University of East Anglia and an author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of hypnotic","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘hypnotic’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘hypnotic’.Share your photos of what hypnotic means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 October at 10am.

Since his breakthrough role in the Stephen Frears-directed drama Dirty Pretty Things in 2002, Ejiofor has become a fixture in British cinema and Hollywood, with appearances in Love Actually, Kinky Boots, Children of Men, American Gangster and The Martian.Arguably his career high point (so far) was his Oscar-nominated performance as Solomon Northup in Steve McQueen’s drama 12 Years a Slave. Ejiofor has also dipped a toe in directorial waters with the Malawi-set The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, about a villager who invents a wind turbine. And that’s not even counting his stage work, which includes an acclaimed Othello at the Donmar Warehouse in 2007 and Everyman at the National Theatre in 2015.This year is a Disney one-two: we have already seen the release of The Lion King, for which Ejiofor voiced the rascally Scar in the CGI “live action” remake, and just about to arrive is Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in which he plays a wise clan chieftain who counsels Angelina Jolie’s Maleficent.He’ll be with us for a webchat on Thursday 10 October at 1.20pm BST so send us your questions now, and we’ll get as many answered as time allows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ce39b1db9f33141291aca5a6a828973d27e140/245_192_1502_901/master/1502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bce8356fea643c3e49d2150c4ef4813","title":"dario gradi retires crewe fa suspension","story":"Dario Gradi has officially ended his long and chequered career in football after nearly three years of being suspended from his role at Crewe Alexandra, amid continuing questions about his conduct as a work colleague of two of the sport’s worst paedophiles.Gradi, 78, was suspended by the Football Association in December 2016 after the ’s interview with a former Crewe player, Andy Woodward, enveloped the fourth-tier club in scandal and led to Barry Bennell, one of their former coaches, being jailed for 31 years.Gradi had always denied any wrongdoing but has faced calls from Bennell’s victims, all former junior players at Crewe and Manchester City, for his resignation, having raised serious questions about what he knew and what he did about it.In August, an independent inquiry into a separate abuse scandal concluded that Gradi had information that might have stopped another serial abuser who was feared to have preyed on more than 25 victims.According to the findings of a two-and-a-half-year investigation, Gradi failed to report one of Chelsea’s scouts, Eddie Heath, when they worked together in the early 1970s, despite receiving a complaint that his colleague had indecently assaulted one boy in the showers.Instead Gradi, then Chelsea’s assistant manager, visited the boy’s parents and admitted in his own evidence to the inquiry that he did not want the matter to go any further. “I’d got no intention of getting Eddie Heath into trouble,” he said.Gradi joined Crewe in 1983 and had 24 years and more than 1,000 first-team games as manager, as well as having a spell as managing director and, latterly, director of football. He was described by Crewe in a statement announcing his retirement as “the club’s most successful manager having won four promotions, most notably guiding the club into the second tier of English football in 1997 and again in 2003”.Gradi was awarded an OBE for services to football in 1998 and, making no mention of his suspension in their statement, the club added: “Crewe Alexandra would like to thank Dario for his outstanding 36 years of service to the football club and are pleased to know that he would be happy to continue to assist the club’s senior coaching staff with his invaluable experience in the future.”Officially, however, Gradi’s suspension means he is not allowed to take part in any football-related activities and his position has appeared untenable since Charles Geekie, the QC who was appointed to oversee the Chelsea inquiry, delivered his report.Geekie led a 17-strong legal team that dealt with eight police forces and conducted 139 interviews before reaching his findings. Gradi, Geekie wrote, had given “somewhat unlikely and unconvincing” evidence.“Mr Gradi is the single example of a clear account of an adult in a position of responsibility being informed about an allegation in relation to Mr Heath. The complaint … was not referred to more senior members of the club and an opportunity to prevent Mr Heath from going on to abuse others was lost.“The very purpose of this review is to shine a light on matters such as this. The events involving Mr Gradi are central to the purpose of this review. There is, I consider, a significant public interest in matters such as this being brought fully and openly into view. I consider it absolutely necessary … to name Mr Gradi.”Bennell, who was appointed by Gradi as Crewe’s youth-team coach, was described by the prosecution as an “industrial-scale child molester” and a “predatory and determined paedophile” during a trial in early 2018 that concluded with him being found guilty of 50 specimen charges of raping and molesting 12 junior footballers, aged eight to 14, from 1979 to 1990. It is his fourth prison sentence, three in England and one in the US, and he is now facing the possibility of more charges.Greg Clarke, the chairman of the Football Association, described the “tidal wave” of other reports of sexual abuse as the biggest crisis he could remember in the sport and another QC, Clive Sheldon, has been putting together a full report which is also likely to look at Gradi’s association with Bennell. That is expected to be released next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f6231a1f7d24d1460e47230dc67fc827149dcf/161_454_3989_2393/master/3989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=339790409cca25d5d19867b8de2f34fa","title":"spread word iraqis translating internet into arabic","story":"Ameen al-Jaleeli and a team of student translators are working to empower people with knowledgeWhen Islamic State overran the Iraqi city of Mosul, human life was not the only thing in peril. Knowledge was, too.Fortunately, Ameen al-Jaleeli understood this. He used a friend’s wifi to transfer a vast batch of Wikipedia files for offline usage. When the militants cut the cables in July 2016, he was ready.“Reading gives me the feeling that I’m still a human being, especially when living under Isis, because knowledge has no limits,” he said. “Even under the airstrikes, I used to put my earphones on, listen to music and read.”Jaleeli downloaded files in English because Arabic is severely underrepresented on the internet. Now that the city has been liberated from Isis, he and a team of student translators at the University of Mosul are setting about redressing that imbalance.Together, they are making Wikipedia pages, academic articles and seminal works covering science, literature and philosophy available to Arabic speakers in attempt to confront lies with logic and pit critical thinking against propaganda and fake news.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

It has also translated books, including Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker and Waking Up by Sam Harris.Requests are flooding in and IBB is doubling the team of 60 translators to work with six more universities across Iraq as well as branching into Kurdish and Farsi. Every week, the team posts about a different female scientist on social media.“It’s very important to raise the understanding of people here that women can do anything,” said Shahd Shahin, 25, who recently graduated after suspending her studies for several years when Isis shut down schools and universities in Mosul.At the time, Shahin was too terrified to leave the house, so she stayed inside, reading works about science and space downloaded on her phone. “I had my books. When I read I used to go to another world.”Momen Mohamad, a third-year student, spends two hours a day translating articles for the project. He will be paid a small stipend but money is not what motivates him.“I want to do something good as a person from Mosul and show the world that we can achieve things,” he said. “Going through a really tough time helped us understand the world better and look to improve our knowledge.”IBB makes material available via PDFs, which can be downloaded for free. But on the street readers are finding their own ways to spread the word.“People have started unofficially printing our books or distributing them via Telegram and other platforms to avoid censorship,” Mutar said.What started as a translation project is rapidly becoming a youth movement, he added. “These are people who have every reason to feel hopeless – all they have known is war and destruction – yet they wake up every morning and translate stories about culture and ersity because they want to be part of a solution that makes their country a better place.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Unthinkably, the seeds are meant to be changed “every two to three days, but can be kept on for a week”. I’m not convinced these seeds would stay in place for three minutes if I was dead.The instructions recommend cleaning one’s ear with alcohol before application: a faff, as I’m guessing they don’t mean a rum and coke. Eventually I find a suitable alcohol cleaner, which dries my skin of oils and means the discs stay put. Unfortunately, my head now smells of a KFC wipe.Should anyone interested in golden ear seeds manage to couple up – one would assume it was with an equal idiot, but let’s pretend not – how would they explain the purchase? “I’ve bought a handful of expensive, microscopic marbles”? At least when Jack traded the family cow for magic beans, he had a beanstalk the next day. There was actual produce involved. These aren’t even real seeds. So what is the point of these gaudy little pips, these golden nuggets of futility?Ear seeds are an ancient element of Chinese medicine, sourced from an actual plant, the vaccaria herb. Yet there is nothing bling about medicine made from the seeds of a weed. Vie Healing are based in West Hollywood, a clue as to the real aim here. (Ironically, weed is popular there, too.) “Enjoy the golden look, the nourishing feeling and this unique approach to easing your symptoms,” the box reads. Vanity, novelty and nonsense, together at last. I get the feeling this is mostly about looking special.My worry, though, is that I look too special. The seeds are nestled in a part of my body I can’t see, so enjoying “the golden look” is frankly a bust. A nourishing feeling? I am mostly experiencing profound anxiety that the missing seeds might find their way into my brain and tunnel through it. As for the unique approach to easing my symptoms, I could train a pigeon to answer my emails but nothing would get done. Press or stimulate the pellets throughout the day, the box says. I walk around, stimulating my pellet and feeling – this may shock you – nothing. Well, that’s not strictly true: it turns out it’s quite painful to push tiny ballbearings into one’s sensitive bits. The 24-carat-plated “ion seeds” apparently stimulate reflex centres of the brain “to help you achieve your Calm”, a claim so foggy I can see mist coming off it.Of course, many believe ear seeds placed on meridian lines clear up qi blockages, which may be true. Even if not, the placebo effect is powerful. But I would rather have a trained practitioner apply them, rather than this keyhole surgery with oven mitts.In fairness, the seeds remain in place for days, even after sleep and showers. They are non-invasive and harmless but also ineffective. I resemble a poundshop Lady Gaga who has lost his tiny marbles. You would be better off sticking 24 golden carrots up your arse.Vie Healing? Not v healing at all.Earful. I mean awful. 15 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

They were close friends for more than a decade before they became a coupleWhen Dee and Joe became neighbours in 1973, it wasn’t love at first sight. “He moved in to my block of flats with his wife and their two children,” says Dee, who was a single mother at the time. “I didn’t see him in a romantic way.” There were a lot of young families in this block in south-west London and it was a tightknit community. “We were neighbours first,” says Joe. “Then we became friends. It was a really nice place to live.” A year later Dee met a new partner and moved to a house nearby, but they never lost contact. “Joe and I stayed friends and we’d often take the children out for meals.”The relationship remained platonic, but Joe says it was clear they enjoyed doing the same things. “It wasn’t romance but we were always happy going out as a group with our families,” he says. “I worked shifts for London Underground, so I’d often take her boys out when I wasn’t working.” Dee went on to have two more children with her new partner, never imagining that there could be anything more than friendship between her and Joe.By the early 1980s, Dee’s mum had became unwell and moved in with her. To help the family, Joe came over to do the gardening.“At the time I’d gone back to college to take my A-levels and I think this really inspired Joe,” says Dee. “One day he answered one of my essay questions and when I showed it to my tutor, she said: ‘He should be doing a degree.’” Joe had never had the opportunity to complete his education, and believed that studying could open new doors. “Life was OK, but I felt like I could achieve more. Dee really encouraged me with that in a way others hadn’t.” After completing his exams, Joe went on to further education and eventually trained as a social worker.When they began studying together, it became apparent that something in their relationship had shifted. “I just looked at him one day and realised that I couldn’t imagine my life without him.” Both Dee and Joe had drifted apart from their partners, but were careful about exploring their new love. “It was a difficult situation and we kept getting together and breaking up for a while,” says Dee. The pair finally became an official couple in 1987, when they both realised they wouldn’t be happy unless they were together. Although it was a “strange transition” from being friends, they’ve never regretted it. “Joe makes me laugh until my sides split. I always tell people if you want a really amazing relationship, be with someone who is your best friend.”As a white woman and a mixed-race man, they had to deal with some bigoted comments. Although Joe has experienced racism all his life, this was a shock for Dee. “We had people saying a few rude things to us when we got together, which never happened when we were friends.”Despite some difficult times, the pair have only grown closer over the years. “I love that Dee is such a ‘doer’,” says Joe. “Any suggestion she makes I know it will be great. We’ve been on a brilliant journey together.”The couple got married in 1995 and adopted a daughter seven years later. “Between us we’ve got seven children, 13 grandchildren and two dogs, so we’re always busy,” says Dee. The pair are now in their 70s, but have no desire to slow down. They love travelling, spending time with their family and having new adventures. “I love how Joe is so easy-going and always goes along with whatever I suggest,” Dee says.Thirty-two years since they got together, the romance is as strong as ever. “It always feels new and exciting to me, and I feel happy when I know I’m going to see him,” says Dee.“And I always feel happy to see the dogs,” laughs Joe. “No, I’m just kidding. I always look forward to seeing Dee. We have amazing lives.”Want to share your story?

Today, I called for a third time. Judging by complaints on Trustpilot, I am not alone. PS, LondonJohn Lewis says that this was not a repeat of the IT problems its card holders suffered back in 2016. Instead, this was a planned security update that required some customers to log into their online accounts again, and reset their passwords.It seems that the locked-out customers all started calling HSBC, which could not cope. John Lewis has apologised to all those affected and PS has since had a call back and is up and running. Overall, there is nothing special about this card. Might it be time to switch provider?We have been contacted by several Thomas Cook customers asking where the firm’s collapse leaves them. MH had booked a £303 flight that obviously won’t be going ahead. We recommended that she file a claim with her bank card provider and hope that they will refund her. If she has travel insurance with scheduled airline failure then she could claim on that. Because it was a flight-only deal, she is not covered by the Atol scheme.Another reader was in the middle of a food poisoning claim with the company after becoming ill during a holiday in Turkey. As the firm no longer exists the legal action, in effect, dies. She could pursue the hotel in Turkey, although that’s probably not a realistic option.A bigger problem is for Thomas Cook airline customers who had EU delay claims waiting to be paid. Many, who will have been expecting hundreds of pounds each, are highly unlikely to get a penny as they join the long list of unsecured creditors.Specialist lawyers Bott and Co has 3,500 unpaid flight delay claims against Thomas Cook, as well as a further 162 holiday sickness or accident claims.

But when times got tough, she realised keeping up with appearances can only make you lose sight of life’s meaningI arrive at six in the morning, two hours before the store opens. Awaiting me is an aisle of boxes, stacked up. One last sip of my coffee, then I put on my gloves and take a big breath. Time to go in.I lug boxes, slash open tops with my cutter, put new packages of whole‑grain seeded bread, naan and seasonal sugar cookies on the shelves, and then haul the overstock to the back freezer. It takes me nearly an hour to stack all the boxes in the right places, label them and leave the freezer clean. Then I walk to the bakery department and make sure the doughnuts are glazed and set in the case, waiting.By eight o’clock, when the store opens, I have made an inviting space for the first customers. At 10, during my lunch break, I meet my husband at the sports bar down the street for a plate of hash browns, sausages and eggs over easy. I am hungry. I have worked hard.I am a James Beard award–winning gluten‑free cookbook author. And for nine months, I worked in our local grocery store for $15 an hour.It is the best job I have ever worked.Online, no one knows you are poor. No one is posting photos of the basket of bills overflowing, some of the envelopes with urgent stamped on them. Very few people write about the choices they make out of fear of going bankrupt, like selling expensive camera lenses that feel less important than rent. And few of us want to admit that we are struggling with money, even though we live in a culture where the rich have grown astronomically rich and the rest of us have grown anxious about health insurance. As my friend Ashley Ford wrote online one day: “I’m trying to choose an insurance plan, but I’m pretty sure the only good insurance is wealth.”I never shared online the time that my husband Danny and I looked at our bank account and saw $85 left for the last week of the month. We didn’t have a savings account. We didn’t have a 401(k) to drain for emergency funds. I had already done that eight years before. Our credit score was shot by the medical bills we couldn’t pay after my daughter Lucy’s terrifying time and the hospital stay for my ministroke.We had only $85 and no way to charge anything on a credit card. Luckily, we were expecting a $6,000 check from a freelance gig, but it had been delayed. Still, we were like most Americans – living paycheck to paycheck (almost eight out of 10 Americans, according to reputable studies) and unable to pay for an unexpected bill of more than $500 (nearly six out of 10 Americans). We were struggling. And we were terrified. I realized that the mindset of worrying that we might go broke was damaging us.I was no longer interested in following my bliss. I wanted to pay my bills.Several artist friends recommended I find a manual labor job, one that would require none of my mind. I had never worked a job that merely asked me to show up. I found out that working part‑time at the grocery store – three days a week – would give me health insurance for the entire family. And maybe putting premade pies on a display table would give me some time to think. So the next time I took a case of our gluten‑free flour mix into our grocery store, I delivered an invoice and a job application. They hired me that week.They put me in the bakery. Since I have celiac, I can’t eat even a bit of gluten. But the bakery section in the grocery store is almost all packages, and I’m not allergic to plastic. It was a bit of a shock, at first, not being able to stop what I was doing to work on an essay or take photographs. Or check Twitter. After years of being a freelancer, I couldn’t believe how wild my mind was when asked to do a task and then check back with my supervisor (a former student of mine) to ask what task she wanted me to complete next. I noticed that my mind balked. I kept working. And after a few weeks of shelving bags of croutons and cleaning out the cake case, I started to enjoy the wildness of my mind. At the store, I had to show up on time, do my work, then leave it all behind. I didn’t know work could be that easy.Friends came into the store and we would talk in three‑minute bursts as I stocked frozen pizzas. Customers asked me questions about where we kept that one brand of whole‑wheat bread, since it was the only one their kids would eat. I answered dozens of little questions a day. I realized that I liked feeling useful.And all day long, I saw people, in tiny bantering interactions and questions. I developed a daily routine with fellow employees: a check‑in at the cheese counter, a quick conversation about politics in produce. I would never have met any of these people I came to like, any other way. I started to feel like part of the community of my town.On my lunch hours, I sat at the front of the store, taking notes. On the backs of papers that read “Grain‑free flatbread, $6.49 each”, I started writing lists. I look back at them now and realize I was clearing my mind of how I had lived. I wrote lists of what I wanted to accomplish in our house, our medical appointments, our taxes. I jotted down ideas for how to let go of my blog, Gluten‑Free Girl. And I started taking notes on what I noticed about customers who had less money than most.I noticed that the people who lived on the day‑old breads around furtively to make sure no one saw when they reached into the discount bin. I led one woman to the back of the store to find the package of day‑old rolls I had put in there, the gravy packets on sale, and some croutons for stuffing. “Thank you!” she said before she put her arms around me. “I’m going to have Thanksgiving because of you.”Each day, at about two, I walked to the back freezer with a laminated list and a tall cart. I pulled boxes down from the top of the back freezer. Methodically, with plastic gloves on, I pulled the doughnuts – raspberry filled, Bavarian cream, chocolate glazed – and put them on black trays in a specified pattern. I was in the freezer by myself, pulling the doughnuts, humming a little. And then I wheeled the cart to the cooler, ready for the morning crew to bake them the next day.Years before, I would have disdained these doughnuts: full of sugar, premade months before in a factory.In the second year of my blog, I wrote a silly little piece about how Danny and I stood in line at the store and wondered at the crap in other people’s carts. I received emails telling me I was being a food snob. At first defensive – come on, America eats lousy food! – I came to understand how wrong I had been. A woman shared with me how little she makes on her teaching salary in Oklahoma, how she visits the food bank to make it, and how a trip to the grocery store for cheap cake is an experience only reserved for once in a while when she can’t stand the shame anymore. I was chastened and changed. And now I try to do better. How do I know that the woman buying the 99‑cent doughnuts at our store isn’t giving her two kids the only treat she can afford that week? And who am I to say that they shouldn’t eat those doughnuts?One day, I had a long conversation with the store’s owner. At 89 years old, he had owned the store for 53 years. His grandson had taken over managing the store, but the owner still clocked in twenty hours a week. Mostly, he spent that time in the city, at a store in a low‑income neighborhood. He consulted a list of the 20 top‑selling foods at our store. If the price in the city was lower, he called his grandson and told him to lower the price on ours. I stopped him one day to thank him for all that he did for our community. He told me: “It befuddles me that people put their focus on what is happening across the country and the world. There is enough to do here.”A few months after I started working there, I switched away from the bakery to bagging groceries. I loved the rhythm of fitting in food like a Jenga game. I have a lot of friends on the island. People who recognized me from my website came through my line. It took me a while to stop talking so much and focus on my work instead. (The assistant manager had to reprimand me in his office for that. I learned fast.) So I had the chance to do what I have always loved most: observe people when they’re not watching me.I learned that very few people make the highly styled dishes offered on Instagram. Oh sure, about every two weeks someone would come through with a bag full of vegetables, determined to juice for 30 days to lose weight. A few people bought jo‑jo potatoes from the deli and an energy drink. But both of these were the outliers. Instead, most people bought meats, cheeses, some fruits and vegetables, three to five packaged crunchy foods, cat litter, toilet paper, beverages, butter, pads and some kind of sweet thing or two. Maybe three people a day were buying ingredients for a specific recipe. Over and over, I saw that what my fellow recipe developers and I hashed out to make ourselves relevant – Vegan treats for the whole family! How to use hempseed! – was not being made in most homes. It humbled me.I started paying attention to the people who shopped for the entire week with a plan. I took note of their food as I bagged it and how much it cost. I compared it to the people – like my husband and me – who shopped at the last moment. We were spending too much money on food. I started buying our meat from the discount bin and giving ourselves a limit on how much money we could spend each day. Our grocery bill started to grow smaller. Shopping was no longer a decadent pleasure for us but a mindset for being able to cook and eat without stress.I left the job, eventually, because another opportunity worth more money walked into my path. And then, when that fell through, the next step arrived. Danny is the one working three days a week now, expediting in a restaurant, mostly for the connection with our community. I no longer earn any money online.When I go back to the store, every Sunday, my daughter skipping next to the cart, I hug my friends who work there. As I pass the front counter on my way out, I remember the urgency of those lunch‑hour breaks – writing notes on the backs of recycled sale signs, where I first imagined the idea, then created the structure, and jotted down some of the first sentences for this book."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51668215fd016c829056dd38e3a364defaeb026b/117_161_3220_1931/master/3220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=905099994d87e5b40803a6a67260e734","title":"lloyd cole and the commotions how we made rattlesnakes","story":"‘I was showing off with words – I’d read about Bob Dylan seducing women by writing songs for them’My idea was to be some sort of male Aretha Franklin, but then the five of us realised we could make this distinctive noise together. Between 1983 and 84, we went from being a wimpy band who sounded like the Style Council to more of a rock band. When I wrote Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken? it made us realise what we could do. I took a Portastudio to my room in Glasgow Golf Club, where my parents worked and lived, and wrote Perfect Skin and Forest Fire. Not one song on Rattlesnakes was more than a year old when it was recorded.Many of the songs are based on a year I spent in London studying law, when I was 18 or 19. The landscape for the album was my imagination. I’d been to Europe once, but my romantic imagery was from books or films. I stumbled on a way of creating an image with very few words. Everyone knows exactly what a “Grace Kelly car” looks like, and it’s probably in the south of France. I sang “Read Norman Mailer, get a new tailor” because he represented masculinity, the hard man. Similarly, Simone de Beauvoir represented modern feminist thinking.Perfect Skin’s Louise wasn’t real, though. I’d read about Bob Dylan seducing women by writing songs for them, so I was showing off with words: “She’s got cheekbones like geometry and eyes like sin and she’s sexually enlightened by Cosmopolitan.” When I sing that live now, I go: “Who isn’t?”The idea for the song Rattlesnakes came from a line in Joan Didion’s book, Play It As It Lays: “Life is a crap game, and there are rattlesnakes under every rock.” I sing that someone “looks like Eve Marie Saint” because she looked how I thought these characters in my songs should look: beautiful fragility.It was very exciting. We’d been playing gigs to 500 people in Glasgow, but empty rooms in England. Then Perfect Skin came out, Radio 1 played us, we did Top of the Pops, and we never played an empty room again.I was playing with Alan McGee when a friend told me that this English guy had borrowed his Portastudio and was writing fantastic songs. Lloyd was different then, awkward and gauche. He wore tweed, smoked Player’s Navy Cut and had that hair, so he probably felt a bit weird in Glasgow.He had an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music. We had black girl singers and were trying to be a soul band, when Bobby Bluebell interviewed us for a Glasgow magazine. He told Lloyd to listen to Dylan’s Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde albums and he was right, that was the turning point. I wrote the chords for Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken? and Lloyd wrote the lyrics.The arts weren’t just for posh people. Most of us were on the dole, which gave us time to create. I woke up one morning with the riff for Rattlesnakes in my head. I said to my girlfriend: “I’ve got to get this down on the Portastudio NOW!” She was like: “You’ve what?”Getting Paul Hardiman as producer was incredibly exciting. He’d just finished the The’s Soul Mining, and he was great at marshalling a young, naive bunch from Glasgow in our first major recording, working in John Foxx’s Garden Studio in London. One night, the rest of the band wanted to go for a curry, but I wanted to put more guitar on Forest Fire.I came up with this epic solo, and Paul and I stayed up all night recording it. At 2am, with everything turned up, it sounded incredible, but the next day I thought we’d gone over the top and wanted to take some of it off. Paul said: “No, play it to everyone as it is” and everyone agreed it was incredible, so we left it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d804f32cc7daed83ba332cae1912732c9ea7d6e6/573_124_4153_2492/master/4153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=224f07f763763ddcdd8a782b6cb683c2","title":"a life in pictures ginger baker","story":"From psychedelic rockers Cream in the 1960s to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, see images from across Ginger Baker’s varied career"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/0_0_6537_3922/master/6537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aee42e8ee5120c99caea0a71d4df2a8","title":"reality tv social media and living your life online with jia tolentino","story":"Jia Tolentino, described as one of the world’s greatest young essayists, discusses how the age of the internet has fundamentally changed who we are.

Our young people should be supported in adolescence, a time that should be as full of wonder and as free from trouble as possible. With each young person we have just one chance to get it all right.“The cuts to public services over the last decade have hit young people particularly hard. Life for young people in Britain today is far harder than it needs to be, and worse in many ways than it was for previous generations.”The Labour leader added: “We need local youth services across the whole country. We need services that can meet the complex challenges faced by young people today. We need services that will nurture and empower young people to improve their own lives.”The plan would involve a law being passed to put in place a “youth service guarantee”, with local authorities mandated to set up partnerships to deliver the services, and funded to do so.It would also see young people represented on the national body for youth work, and on local planning bodies, with a statutory right to consultation for young people and their organisations.Another element would involve recruiting and training “a cohort of young inspectors to empower young people to measure the quality and impact of the youth offer”.The party has not immediately said how much the policy would cost, or how it would be financed, saying both would be outlined in its “fully costed manifesto” before the next general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3ca72c3b12c84daa800f915ff801eadf199205/0_559_6519_3912/master/6519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262d205bc55da9d1718d89b4dfb92d6a","title":"ive been here 50 years the eu citizens struggling for the right to stay in britain","story":"If they don’t secure the correct status, EU nationals living in the UK post-Brexit will be classified as illegal immigrants. And after the Windrush scandal, we know what that looks like. By  Amelia GentlemanIn early May, Doris Ratnam sat at her kitchen table, trying to scan her German passport with her mobile phone. She was applying for “settled status” in the UK, the new immigration status the 3.4 million or so EU nationals living in Britain need to acquire if they want to stay in the country legally after Brexit. Ratnam, who is 72 and has lived in London since arriving as an au pair in 1968, was annoyed that she should be required to apply to remain in a country she considers her home.She was flustered by the process of attempting to get her phone to suck all her personal details out of her passport. Something was not working, and we sat for 20 minutes in near silence as she moved the phone slowly over the cover of the passport, as shown in a reassuring Home Office Youtube video, trying to get it to read the chip hidden inside the document. “Move the phone to read the chip,” Ratnam muttered, studying the guidance notes. “What am I supposed to do? Move the phone to find the chip. I feel stressed … it’s the technology.”After repeated failed attempts, the app informed her she had been locked out of the system for 24 hours. It would take two-and-a-half months, two visits to the local town hall (an hour on two buses each way), a £15 appointment fee and numerous calls to a Home Office helpline before her status was approved. The process was dispiriting. “I shouldn’t be made to feel like a foreigner again after such a long time here,” she said.Before the end of June 2021, if Britain leaves the EU with a deal, or by 31 December 2020 with no deal, all EU nationals resident in the UK must have applied for settled status if they want to continue living and working here. The EU settled status scheme is designed to fulfil the government’s promise that all EU citizens, their family members, and dependants living here before Brexit, will be entitled to remain, with no diminishment of their rights. Anyone who has lived here continuously for five years should, in theory, be able to get settled status easily people who have been here for less than five years will be granted “pre-settled” status, requiring them to reapply for permanent status once they have racked up enough years of continuous residence (which means not leaving the country for more than six months a year).For Europeans in the UK, the Home Office’s “EU Exit: ID Document Check” app is the gateway between belonging and exclusion. How well this piece of software works will be a crucial factor in the government’s attempts to present Brexit as a success. In the past year, almost 1.5 million Europeans living in the UK have grappled with the Home Office application process and managed to secure settled or pre-settled status. The Home Office would like us to celebrate this as a bureaucratic success story, and in a very optimistic frame of mind, perhaps we might.The government has allocated about £460m to the scheme, of which about £50m was spent on developing this unflashy app, its opening pages headed with the outline of a crown on a royal blue background. At the launch of the scheme in March, a Home Office radio advertising campaign reassured people: “It is free, and all you need is your passport or ID card and to complete an online form.”In May, I was taken on a tour of the Home Office’s Liverpool offices, where 1,500 workers were then handling about 6,000 “settled status” applications a day (it has since risen to 20,000). At the end of the tour, one of the senior civil servants in charge of the scheme said it would be good to see media coverage emphasising how well things are working. “In an ideal world, we want you to write an article saying you have come here, and there’s nothing to be afraid of.”After the deadline, those who have failed to apply will gradually be transformed from legal residents into undocumented migrants. In the hostile environment – the obstructive and unwelcoming bureaucratic culture promoted by Theresa May when she was home secretary – they will be unable to work, rent somewhere to live, access free healthcare, drive, open a bank account, get a mobile phone contract or travel without being asked to prove their status. They will gradually discover that normal life has become impossible.The Home Office has never attempted a digital exercise on this scale. All the unknowns – numbers, timing, terms of the deal – have presented developers with unexpected challenges. By the end of January, two months before it was due to launch nationally, IT specialists working for the Home Office had successfully designed a scheme that charged applicants £65. Days before the app was rolled out for public testing, they were told that the fees were too politically sensitive and needed to be scrapped – leaving them no time to rebuild the app without the fee pages. So, as an awkward last-minute fix, initial applicants were charged anyway and had to get their money refunded later. The decision to scrap the fee also meant the government instantly lost about £190m of revenue that the scheme was meant to bring in.“They were trying to deliver the biggest, most contentious new system that any of them had likely ever worked on, while the basic requirements were changing around them, even days before they went live,” said Joe Owen, the programme director of the Institute for Government, a thinktank working to make government more effective. Owen has been tracing the development of the scheme since the EU referendum.One major problem was that the scheme does not yet work on the iPhone. The Home Office has been struggling with Apple’s refusal to allow third-party developers to use its contactless system since the start of the app’s development. Given that iPhones account for almost half the smartphones in the UK, this creates a major headache for applicants. Many people have had to borrow phones, or take the longer route of sending off their passports for manual scanning. Officials say the app should begin to be available on iPhones later this month.Another complication is that it is not known how many EU nationals there are in the UK. The figure of 3.4 million that the government is basing all its plans on is thought by many to be an underestimate.“Nobody knows exactly how many are eligible,” said Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. The government’s estimate was “almost certain to be too low because it doesn’t include people living in non-private addresses like hostels or care homes, and the figures are thought to undercount several groups – new arrivals, EUnon-EU dual citizens, and people who spend part of the year outside the UK.”Nor does the estimate include close family members from non-EU countries, who are also eligible under this scheme. The total number of people who need to apply could perhaps be as high as 4 million.For the moment the political rhetoric remains warm, and officials say people who have a good reason for missing the deadline will be allowed a “reasonable” further period to apply, but the small print spells out the chilling consequences of failing to get status. Although politicians are not currently choosing to highlight this publicly, the Home Office has made it clear in planning documents that, from January 2021 (in a no-deal scenario), anyone without valid UK immigration status “will be liable to enforcement action, detention and removal as an immigration offender”.It is not surprising that so many of the 3 million-plus are feeling vulnerable and furious. They were demonised by the leave campaign as the problem to which Brexit was the solution they have faced years of hostile newspaper headlines they are angry that the scheme has been developed as an application process rather than a registration scheme (meaning that the status is only acquired by successfully applying for it under a registration scheme, EU citizens who had failed to apply successfully for the status would not immediately become illegal). They point out that this is not the automatic guarantee of rights the Vote Leave campaign and the government promised. Being forced to apply for the right to stay in their homes has been the final insult. For all its royal blue neutrality, many see the app as performing a distasteful political function – locating them, counting them and classifying them.Meanwhile, all over Europe, about 1.4 million expatriate Britons are anxiously monitoring the scheme, aware that their own treatment could depend largely on how generously the UK government treats EU citizens.In April 2018, it emerged that thousands of people who had been born in Commonwealth countries and moved to the UK as children in the 1960s and 70s, when there was free movement between Britain and its former colonies, had become the victims of changes to immigration legislation. In what became known as the Windrush scandal, those who had never applied for British passports found themselves wrongly classified as immigration offenders. Some were detained and removed from the UK, back to countries they had not visited in half a century. Others lost their jobs or homes or were denied NHS treatment.Their experiences have alarmed EU nationals. The scandal highlighted how poor the Home Office’s capacity is for accurately identifying who is living in the UK legally or illegally, and its reputation has crystallised as an institution that combines malice with incompetence. Many of those obliged to apply for the scheme find the prospect of giving all their personal details to the Home Office disturbing.For about a quarter of applicants, the process is more complicated than simply submitting passport details and completing an online form. The Advertising Standards Authority has recently ruled that the reassuring Home Office radio advertisement must not be broadcast again, after a complainant pointed out that in some cases applicants had to provide much more documentation than just a passport or ID card.Since the beginning of the year, Labour has been warning of looming problems with the system, even talking of “Windrush on steroids”. But such warnings are often firmly slapped down as just being part of “project fear”. (“I find your comparisons to Windrush inappropriate,” Priti Patel, the home secretary, told the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this month.)Even the Conservative and arch Brexiter MEP Daniel Hannan has voiced concern on Twitter, warning that he has had cases of EU nationals in his south-east England constituency being denied settled status despite living in the UK for years. “This is a breach of the assurances I and others gave during the referendum.” He called on Patel “to sort this out … before we end up with another Windrush scandal”.Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the3million, an organisation set up to support EU nationals, describes the decision to introduce an application system with a cut-off date as a timebomb, because so many will fail to apply on time. Switching metaphors, he warns this will be an “illegal immigrants factory … designed to create thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants”.At the Home Office building in Liverpool, where many of the 1,500 people employed to process the applications are based, there is a relentlessly positive atmosphere. Everyone here is aware of the damage done to the Home Office’s reputation by Windrush. In recent years, the Home Office has been condemned by politicians for being steeped in a “culture of disbelief”, where staff are expected to probe for tiny inconsistencies in the accounts of refugees, and where officials are instructed to “deport first, hear appeals later”.Many Windrush victims described how they had tried repeatedly to explain that they were not illegal immigrants, but had been ignored, or simply unable to find a Home Office caseworker ready to listen. Before she resigned, Amber Rudd apologised for the “appalling” actions of her own department, blaming a culture in the Home Office which had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”. In turn, her successor Sajid Javid promised to introduce a “fairer, more compassionate” immigration system. This hasn’t materialised in most of the department, according to immigration lawyers and caseworkers, but in these open-plan offices in Liverpool, up an escalator, above a Tesco and a florist, something does appear to have changed.If things are working, the full application should take about 15 minutes (there are a few more questions on residency and criminality once ID checks are completed). Under the new scheme, the Home Office doesn’t care if applicants are self-sufficient, studying or working – simply whether they are resident in the UK or not this is verified by making instant checks with HMRC. Applicants have to do three things: prove their identity, show that they live in the UK and declare any criminal convictions. Once data has been scanned from people’s passports via their phone, they have to take a selfie, so the app can identify if the correct person is applying. The app checks identity through facial matching in the same way travellers are checked in airports at e-passport gates.To reduce the possibility of fraud, there is no physical document at the end of the process, just a digital record, which can be shared with a landlord or an employer (after Brexit, they will have to check EU nationals’ eligibility) via a time-limited unique code, on a smartphone.On one floor in Liverpool, staff sit at computers flicking through screens. A passport photograph flashes up, and the employee checks to make sure it matches the selfie taken and submitted through the app. Although much of the system is automated, every case is checked by a human before a decision is made. These human checks can take just 10 minutes. Some people are getting an email back telling them they have settled status within a couple of hours.When I visited, there was a homely smell of microwaved stew helium balloons hovered over the desk of someone who had been given a baby shower. Special EU Settlement Resolution Centre teacups have been printed for staff, with inspirational slogans on them. Most of the staff are newly hired, many of them students. One of the few longer-serving members of staff, who has worked at the Home Office for five years, said it was a relief not to have to be so sceptical when dealing with people’s applications. “Before the onus was more on ‘prove it’. Now we are doing everything we can to help,” she said. “When I first joined, it was noticeable that not many cases would result in us issuing the applicant with what they needed.”The only people likely to be refused will be those with “persistent and serious” criminal records and, so far, only one person has been refused – although a number of people have been dismayed to get the lesser, more precarious pre-settled status, despite having been in the UK for more than five years. Campaigners suspect that the difficult cases may be going to the bottom of the pile, to keep the figures looking favourable.When the project began, one of the senior civil servants in charge ordered a number of copies of a book called In Limbo, compiled by an Italian translator Elena Remigi, so he and colleagues could read the 144 testimonies of EU nationals resident in Britain, people who were worried about their post-Brexit future here, people who are, the blurb says, “haunted by the poignant question: where is home?” They say the book helped them understand the worries faced by those being asked to apply. Videos have been made for people who struggle with literacy, there is helpline assistance for those who are not confident with technology. The guidance has been translated into all 26 languages (although the helpline advice is only available in English and Welsh). In addition, £9m has been allocated to funding charities (organisations such as Citizens Advice and the East European Resource Centre) to help an estimated 200,000 vulnerable or hard to reach people to apply. Downstairs there is a hotline this is the first time in 10 years that people have been able to call a Home Office number and speak to a caseworker, rather than an employee at an outsourced firm, reading from a script.In August, Patel announced an end to freedom of movement in a no-deal scenario at the end of next month. Officials quickly had to clarify on her behalf that free movement would not be ending on that date (since EU law continues to apply until its legal foundation is repealed). Unfortunately, the home secretary’s premature announcement led to a spike in calls leading to long waiting times.“We’re trying to change the perception of the Home Office,” the woman who heads the call centre said. Staff have dealt with a lot of people who were “upset, frightened and angry”, she said. “We understand why. This is something that has happened to those people. They weren’t consulted or even given a vote in it. They are now having to apply for something that they always had.”Windrush victims waited years for anyone to pay attention to their difficulties with the Home Office, as they lost jobs and homes and faced detention. By comparison, a mildly famous French baker or Polish chef struggling with the EU status app need only send an irritated Tweet for newspapers to print outraged articles. The reality TV celebrity Fred Sirieix, after tweeting his frustration, had calls from the Home Office within 24 hours to resolve things. Home Office staff seem at pains to act fast to resolve high-profile cases, to quell the noise but less clear is what happens to those who have less of a public profile.For some people, the experience is genuinely easy. Some people describe doing it while sitting on the sofa at home, and being pleasantly surprised at getting an email confirming that they have been granted settled status within hours. The difficulty is that while around three-quarters are getting through easily and a quarter need to submit further information, a small proportion will have more complicated experiences.We already know that too many people are wrongly being allocated pre-settled status instead of the more permanent settled status, a problem that came up during the testing phase, Home Office staff told me. “One of the things we were surprised about in early testing was that people thought they were clicking the button for full settled status, but they were actually accepting pre-settled status, and then being surprised. So we tried to make quite a lot of changes to the guidance to reinforce that,” an official said.But the problem persists, and campaigners say there are still oddities in the design of the application form, which does not ask people how long they have lived in the UK or which status they hope to get. Only the most well-informed applicants will know they can challenge an incorrect allocation of pre-settled status.The immigration lawyer Chris Desira has spoken to audiences of EU nationals at more than 200 information sessions arranged by embassies and community groups all over the UK in the past three years. He has identified many vulnerable groups who might find it hard to supply the evidence required to prove that they qualify for settled status – elderly people, people with disabilities, children in care, stay-at-home women who haven’t worked or paid bills, and victims of domestic abuse whose partners have all their papers. He is conscious that the awareness of the need to apply has not got through to everyone. “I am massively worried, massively,” said Desira. He has seen older people who have been here for decades crying in meetings, worried they are going to be put on a plane out of the country. “Even when you tell them, ‘I am confident that if you fill in this form, you will be fine, you will get settled status’, the anxiety and the stress and everything that is happening around them prevents them from hearing that message.”His concerns are echoed by Chai Patel of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Migrants, who warns that the scheme is set up to be easy for people who are “wealthy, well-educated people”. He is concerned at the absence of a physical document proving status. “The scheme is very easy if you know your rights, you’re online and you’re bolshie enough to be able to stand up for what you’re entitled to. It won’t work so well for the more vulnerable. We are expecting hundreds of thousands of people to be left without status if the scheme continues as it is,” he said.I met Chris Desira at an event organised in a central London YMCA hall by the German embassy earlier this year, where he and two German diplomats, attempted to answer the questions of people confused by what they needed to do in order to ensure they could continue to live in the UK. While the official line appeared to be “Don’t panic”, the cumulative effect of almost two hours of anxious questions left many feeling disturbed.One by one, German citizens stood up to voice their alarm. “It’s giving me stomach ache. I’ve been here since 1961,” one woman said, before being reassured that she simply needed to make the application, and she would be fine. (Stephanie Dawoud of the immigration charity Imix, who was translating into my ear, said most of the meetings she had attended had a similar feeling of distress, particularly among older people, who were particularly worried by the unfamiliar notion of apps and applying digitally.) A woman in her 30s was worried about whether she should transfer her business out of the country.The German diplomat presiding over the occasion (who asked not to be named) exhibited a mournful sense of humour at some of the questions.“What happens to German civil servants?” someone asked.“I would love to know that, too!” the diplomat replied.“Can I come into the country after Brexit?” one woman asked.“Yes, unless you scare the people are the border into thinking you are a threat to national security,” said the diplomat.“Should I stockpile food?” another wanted to know, to wry laughter from the room.“The exciting thing is that you’re jumping into a big black hole,” the diplomat replied.There were questions about eligibility to healthcare in a no-deal scenario, questions about how to apply for dual nationality and questions about how UK pensions would be uprated if they were paid in Germany. “I have no information whatsoever on how it will pan out. You don’t know what the British government will do,” the diplomat said sadly. Doris Ratnam was at the back of the room, wondering how she was going to organise herself to apply. She had left her small Black Forest village near Baden Baden in 1968, aged 20, hoping to learn English, a language that neither of her parents spoke. She married a Malaysian citizen in London he became naturalised decades ago, but she didn’t want to, because for a long time it was difficult to get British citizenship without losing your German passport. (That changed in the pre-Brexit period.)She felt disheartened at applying for a status she considered to be hers already, as well as alarmed by the digital application. She invited me to watch the process of using the app in May, at her neat north-west London home, reached through a garden of pink roses and trimmed hedges. “I’ve been paying taxes here for 50 years, it should be simple,” she said, offering me coffee and ginger snaps.But her passport could not be read by the app, even though she had travelled through a passport e-gate, which uses the same technology, only four days earlier.The process of applying had made her think about her attitudes to Britishness. “I find it difficult to know after all this time whether I feel at home here. I certainly don’t feel British, like a British person, but I have English friends … I feel in-between I feel both. There’s a saying: the British are too polite to be honest, the Germans are too honest to be polite. I think there is something in it.”On the helpline, after much time listening to jangly hold music, the Home Office helper was both polite and honest, but had no answer as to why the app was not reading the digital code. She was advised to seek out one of the 80 designated EU settlement scheme scanning offices (in council offices and town hall register offices) where the passport could be scanned manually.It took weeks for Ratnam to get an appointment at Ealing town hall, but she finally went on 4 July, consulting a photocopied map to find room 1.13, winding right, then left along echoing corridors, then right, then left again, up some marble steps, past a bust of Chopin through the beautiful, almost empty mock-gothic building, soon to be decommissioned and turned into a boutique hotel. Once we arrived at a small, pink-doored room, the official inside was unable to help, also attempting to swipe the passport on a phone until the system locked her out, too. So Ratnam then sat in the waiting room on the phone to the resolution centre in Liverpool for another 40 minutes , asking for help. “I can only advise that the application is locked for 24 hours. We can’t override that,” an official said. “For the time being there is nothing further we can do to help.”“I’m just fed up,” Ratnam said, a red flush of worry creeping up her neck. “I’m getting worked up I can’t even get my words out. I don’t want to keep trying.”She organised a second appointment at the town hall on 10 July. The passport was finally scanned, quite easily, that day, but two days later she received an email asking her to upload an image of her old passport showing a historic stamp giving her indefinite leave to remain. The same email told her that the Home Office could find no record of her indefinite leave to remain and wanted to “confirm that you are related to your EU family member as claimed”. The email was a mistake. She couldn’t work out how to upload the passport there was another long phone call to Liverpool on 15 July, after which she managed to send off the picture.“I can hear it in your voice, how anxious you are,” a call handler told her.“Why can’t you just check my HMRC records?” Ratnam asked. “I’ve been paying tax for long enough.”On 16 July, an email arrived telling her that her documents had been sent in an “unsupported format and we have been unable to attach the files to your application”. But puzzlingly, a minute later, a second email arrived, saying that her “application to the EU Settlement Scheme has been successful”.Ratnam has managed to secure her status. Nothing catastrophic went wrong with her application – just a series of irritations that sucked up her time and lowered her mood. Similar irritations will be felt by tens of thousands of others going through the process, reinforcing a sense of alienation. “I’m annoyed that I had to do it after 50 years here. There were mistakes and it was stressful. I don’t feel welcome having to go through a process like that.”Campaigners worry most about those who do not realise they need to apply, or those who have difficulties converting their pre-settled status into the permanent settled status in the years that follow Brexit. Nicolas Hatton of the 3million charity warns: “On 1 January 2021, if there is no deal, and you haven’t applied, you will be an illegal immigrant. The hostile environment is no joke. That’s when the timebomb will explode.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc96a16dfed7c8a44b3f89b2a4c5658400864642/0_130_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=224615a91da94e06192826b94a8a6235","title":"no deal brexit would push national debt to levels last seen in 60s","story":"IFS says public borrowing will more than double next year whatever the Brexit resultEmergency tax cuts and higher public spending to offset the impact of a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level in more than half a century, according to Britain’s leading experts on the public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the scale of the government response required to firefight a flatlining economy in the event of a disorderly departure from the EU would come with a hefty price tag for the public purse.In a warning to Boris Johnson as his Brexit plan risked unravelling in the face of stiff opposition at home and abroad, the thinktank said government borrowing was already set to more than double next year regardless of the outcome of negotiations with Brussels.Coming as the prime minister increases funding for healthcare, schools and police, the IFS said a mini-boom in public spending would be followed by another bust because the government would likely struggle to handle the impact of no-deal Brexit, which would shrink the size of the economy and cause debt levels to rise.In a warning that a new wave of austerity could be introduced in the future to limit further debt increases, Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said: “You could well be on an upward spiral of debt and deficit – and in a world in which we have to go through another period of austerity to undo it.”Against a backdrop of mounting speculation over possible tax giveaways ahead of an election, including potential for a cut in fuel duty for motorists, Paul Johnson warned the prime minister that such moves would be dangerous given the heightened level of uncertainty facing the economy and the future state of the public finances.“The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor. Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming budget,” he added.In analysis ahead of a government budget this autumn, the IFS said the deficit – the shortfall between government spending and income from taxes – was already on track to rise to more than £50bn next year from £29.3bn currently, as a result of changes in the treatment of student loans in the national accounts and as Boris Johnson ramps up public spending.However, it said no-deal Brexit could cause economic growth to flatline in 2020-21, even if the Bank of England cut interest rates and the government stepped in with emergency tax cuts and higher spending.The budget deficit peaked in 2009-10 after the banking crisis at almost £160bn, before gradually falling as David Cameron and George Osborne cut spending using a policy of austerity to reduce it.The government’s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecast this year that the deficit should fall to £21.2bn in 2020-21. However, it made its estimate in March on the basis of a smooth Brexit deal.After a decade of austerity the IFS said the government’s near-£14bn spending plans outlined by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, at last month’s spending round for 2020-21 would only return public funding for services as a percentage of national income to levels seen in 2006-07.It said the plans for day-to-day spending next year had taken Conservative policy close to offering the same level of funding for public services implied by Labour’s 2017 manifesto.The IFS said the government had in effect abandoned the former chancellor Philip Hammond’s borrowing rules, including a Conservative manifesto pledge to eliminate the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s.A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “September’s spending round supported the people’s priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be.“Beyond that, the chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity. In so doing we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f6e5732944a966ecdc27991abc6dbfb2d33a4f0/26_0_593_356/master/593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a4b08d62929ff38c775cfabffa95cbb","title":"it was pure method grayling but the tories were wishing for arcuri","story":"At Brexit questions, James Duddridge was excruciating as he stood in at the dispatch boxA star is born. For a couple of months now, the government has been sending emails to casting agents, begging them to find a replacement for Chris Grayling. A minister so useless, so hapless that every appearance in the Commons is guaranteed to be a box office disaster. Many have been called, yet no one has quite come up to scratch. Not even Priti Patel or Liz Truss. Or James Cleverly with his definitive decisiveness graph. AKA My Graph by J Cleverly (aged 11 ¾). Stupidly on the x-axis and Cleverly on the y-axis – with next to nothing registering on the y.But James Duddridge, a junior minister in the Brexit department, looks as if he might be the real deal. In this, his second audition standing in for Steve Barclay inside a week, he revealed his true potential. A man for whom practice makes progressively less perfect.The incompetence could be taken as a given – that’s standard government issue. But what Duddridge brought to his role this time was pure method Grayling. The sense of peevishness that only comes from someone too stupid to realise just how out of their depth they are. The sweaty shiftiness of a man who is dimly aware he is crashing and burning but can’t put his finger on why. It can’t be long before he goes full Grayling and develops a nervous tic. The wobbling cheek was one of the few signs of intelligent life in the former transport secretary.Quite what Duddridge has done to have been thrown under a bus twice in such quick succession is as yet unclear. The chief whip must have some devastating kompromat on him. But at least he’s providing some entertainment at a time of national crisis. He was in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Keir Starmer, requesting the government allow parliament to see the full 44-page legal text of the new withdrawal agreement the EU was in the process of rejecting, rather than just the seven-page summary it had so far been shown. The shadow Brexit secretary was understandably suspicious that there might be something of a mismatch between the two. Not least on provisions for a hard border and the erosion of workers’ rights.“Don’t tell him, Duddridge,” yelled a handful of Tory MPs, who had been briefed to spread the word that only a fool would show their hand by making public a document that had already been seen by the EU27. Just in case the EU leaders hadn’t actually got round to examining it that closely. Besides, only traitors and close family wouldn’t trust the prime minister. The patriotic thing to do was to back the deal without reading it.It quickly became clear that not even Duddridge – especially Duddridge – had been considered senior enough in government to be allowed to see the legal text. Which made him the ideal man to answer the question as he couldn’t inadvertently reveal anything incriminating. Except he was peculiarly inept in failing to give any even halfway credible reasons for not releasing the text. There would be no infrastructure at the border apart from the infrastructure at the border. Workers’ rights would actually be improved by deregulation. He was following in the footsteps of the Master. The One True Grayling.Halfway through this excruciating ordeal, the few remaining Tory MPs were beginning to see what Boris Johnson had seen in Jennifer Arcuri and were wishing it was her at the dispatch box and not Duddridge. At least in her interview with Piers Morgan and Susannah Reid on Good Morning Britain she had shown some style as she failed to answer any questions and could bullshit with the best of them. By the end she had failed to deny having sex with the prime minister nine times and had left most viewers wondering if it had been Morgan who had been having the affair with the prime minister and not her. After all, he’d already been kissing Donald Trump’s arse for years.How different it could have been with Arcuri in the chamber.“Will you publish the legal text?” said Starmer.“You’ve been saying that for 10 minutes,” Arcuri would have replied. “Are you in love with me? Do you want to have sex with me?”“Will you publish the legal text?” said Hilary Benn.“I like to talk about Shakespeare.

By comparing images taken over hours and days, the algorithms distinguished between stationary stars and galaxies and moons that hurtled around the planet.At the birth of the solar system, vast amounts of dust and gas circling the sun coalesced into the eight known planets. But Sheppard believes that shortly after Saturn formed, more than 4bn years ago, passing asteroids and comets were captured by the planet’s gravity and have circled it ever since.Depending on the angle of approach, comets and asteroids straying too close to Saturn in the early solar system would have become locked into radically different orbits around the planet. Only three of the new moons have so-called prograde orbits, meaning they circle Saturn in the same direction that it rotates. The other 17 are in retrograde orbits, meaning they orbit the planet backwards. One is the most distant moon ever spotted from the planet.The outer moons of Saturn fall into three broad families according to how they orbit the gas giant. Two of the new prograde moons appear to belong to a group that swings around Saturn at an angle of about 46 degrees. The moons, named after Inuit mythology, may once have belonged to one far larger moon that broke apart in the distant past.The new retrograde moons appear to belong to another group named after Norse mythology and are also thought to be fragments of a much bigger parent moon that was smashed to pieces in the solar system’s violent past.“This kind of grouping of outer moons is also seen around Jupiter, indicating violent collisions occurred between moons in the Saturnian system or with outside objects such as passing asteroids or comets,” Sheppard said.The discovery was announced on Monday by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ee784fcdd4027a5ef4fd8c71226c1032b8aeb04/0_52_1634_980/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=956a0dfa172a1c09e7f770c69bb77bda","title":"mindful music how listening to classical can help you be more present","story":"Classical music is known for its calming properties, but it’s more than pleasant background music. Jonathan Lennie chooses seven tracks that promote a feeling of mindfulness in the present momentLife can be chaotic – between work, family and social commitments many of us have difficulty switching off. And the thought of spending quality time on yourself is often forgotten. This is what mindfulness seeks to address. Non-judgmental moment-to-moment awareness is a form of meditation in which we engage with our thoughts and the world around us in the present moment. And being a spiritual art form of fixed duration, classical music is an ideal medium with which to practise it. Here are seven pieces of classical music that can transport us into a world of relaxation and wellbeing.Edward Elgar – Variations on an Original Theme, Op 36 (Enigma): 9 NimrodNimrod is one of a suite of short pieces from Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations. In popular culture it has become a British anthem, though it was actually a cryptic tribute to his friend Augustus Jaeger. The enigmatic element of the work is useful in mindful listening, in that the overarching musical theme is intended as a mystery that need not be solved – like the mystery of life, to be dipped into as it occurs. Concentrate on what is actually happening in the music as you breathe along with the work’s gentle pulse, rather than zoning out as you anticipate the orchestral climax. The conception of the work is an instance of mindfulness itself. The composer was noodling at the piano when his wife pointed out that he had written a marvellous melody. He had allowed it to emerge, he later said, “from nothing”.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Concert Orchestra’s Orchestra Unwrapped concert on 26 September.Pauline Oliveros – Deep Listening“Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears,” said American experimental composer Pauline Oliveros. She became obsessed with mindfulness through “deep listening”, a term she coined in 1988 after descending four metres into a disused water tank to make a recording of the same name. The underground room had an acoustic resonance lasting 45 seconds, allowing the musicians to create a smooth overlapping texture by listening carefully to each other. The album Deep Listening presents four pieces conceived as an aid to mindful focus. Choose one of them, concentrate on the constant drone of the didgeridoo, then become aware of the slowly evolving sounds of accordion and voice as they expand and contract around it. Purge your mind of clutter as you focus on this swirling soundscape, allowing the melodic trombone line to order your thinking.Gustav Mahler – Symphony No 2 (Resurrection), UrlichtGustav Mahler declared that: “A symphony must be like the world. It must contain everything.” To experience his immense symphonies is, therefore, to musically engage with the vastness of the human experience, and his second is a case in point. It starts with a funeral march and questions the randomness of life, before concluding that it is wondrous and meaningful. This positivity begins in the fourth movement, Urlicht (Primal Light), a slow, simple song arranged for solo singer and sparse orchestra. When the choir, with full orchestra, enters for the final Resurrection movement and sings: “Die shall I in order to live rise again, yes rise again”, feel the energy flow through your body, swelling and expansive like the music.Johannes Ockeghem – Alma Redemptoris MaterIf ever there was a form of music designed for mindful reflection, it is Renaissance polyphony, which shows the beauty and complexity that can be achieved by voices alone. Alma Redemptoris Mater by Johannes Ockeghem is such an example. Written during the 15th century, this sacred motet is presented by just four voices. Close your eyes, breathe and follow the inidual vocal lines as they flow together and apart, weaving a rich harmonic tapestry of sound. Focus on the beauty of the words: “Loving mother of the redeemer, who opens the gate to heaven, and star of the sea … You who gave birth, in the wonderment of nature, to your own creator ...” After its five minutes duration, you should feel both calm and focused.You can listen to this piece performed live by the BBC Singers on 7 December.Ralph Vaughan Williams – The Lark AscendingThis exquisite musical depiction of a singing lark taking to the air has been described by British violinist Tasmin Little as “floating above a cushion of sound”. Its composer, Ralph Vaughan Williams was inspired by George Meredith’s poem The Lark Ascending. Read the poem, then listen to the music, focusing on the violin depicting the bird as “He rises and begins to round”. Observe the lark’s efforts to take flight: “As up he wings the spiral stair”, swooping as it trills “A song of light”. Follow its ascent, until at last the full orchestra glides with the creature, saluting its “Serenity in ravishment”. Finally, become the lark, letting your spirit fly free – and, in your mind’s eye, look down upon the rural landscape rolling beneath you.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Symphony Orchestra concert on 1 November.Olivier Messiaen – Quartet for the End of TimeFrench composer Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time is an exceptional example of mindfulness. Incarcerated in a freezing prisoner of war camp, he created a piece about the end of time itself, when all earthly concerns will be swept away as foretold in the Revelation of St John. This extraordinary piece was premiered at the camp on old battered instruments in January 1941. By writing for the only instruments available (violin, cello, clarinet and piano), Messiaen was adapting to the moment, yet was focused on eternity. The mindful theme is also present in the musical structure itself, which is based on an unravelling mathematical sequence that, if played out, would be infinite.John Cage – 4’33’’Mindfulness is about time, specifically now. Consequently, the ultimate work of mindfulness might be John Cage’s 4’33’’. More of an experimental concept than piece of music, Cage’s 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence presents a set time framework in which a pianist (or any sologroup of musicians) sits at the piano and turns the pages of the empty score in silence. Meanwhile, the audience is invited to listen to the ambient sounds in the auditorium – breathing, air conditioning, the rumble of cars outside ... essentially, listening to the world around them as a unique aural event and appreciating its variety, rather than ignoring it as irrelevant noise. Of course, you don’t have to attend a concert to experience this – just set your timer, close your eyes and listen.Choose your own mindful listening from the BBC’s upcoming series of classical concerts from the BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra and BBC Singers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5599530cd500fb5d4b429fa90b42e2242b69b6cb/10_77_3193_1917/master/3193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81a14dc8498a0eb25c40d308c4a0e77c","title":"rugby world cup pool permutations","story":"Pool A has a winner-takes all finale, Pool B was finished before it started, Pool D can only have a late twist if Fiji surprise Wales and who actually wants to finish top of Pool C?Story so far Who would have thought it? The Pool of Death. Actually, there were clues this might be an interesting group. If a pool can be known by the strength of its third seed, Japan began as the highest ranked of these. Still, beating the No 1 team in the world was really not supposed to happen. All those beyond Ireland will rejoice that it did. Results such as this, like the one Japan achieved by beating South Africa in 2015, are the clearest indication that rugby’s status quo might be changing.What’s still at stake? So beating the No 9 team in the world ought to be easy. If Japan win the pool stage’s grand finale against Scotland on Sunday, they will top the group, earning them the juicy prospect of a Tokyo quarter-final against South Africa (see Brighton 2015). Assuming Scotland take maximum points against Russia on Wednesday, they must beat Japan to qualify and match Japan for any bonus points. If Japan lose with two bonus points the hosts will still top the group. Meanwhile, Ireland need to beat Samoa. The equally juicy prospect of the All Blacks would await if they qualify behind Japan but they could win the pool if Scotland beat Japan. All three could end level on 15 points, in which case points difference will decide top spot, and the head-to-head between second and third then deciding the runner-up.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterStory so far If there were such thing as a Pool of Burgeoning Life, this would be it. To have New Zealand and South Africa in the same pool is a novel twist of deadliness but thereafter the quality falls away horribly. Italy are still tier one’s poor relations, and Canada and Namibia are the only teams here outside the top 20. Sure enough, we were glued to the opener between the two big boys and then said goodbye to the pool. Let’s not expand the World Cup, eh?What’s still at stake? Oh dear. This bit is meant to be 120 words. How to drag out the explanation that qualification from Pool B was settled after one game, New Zealand first, South Africa second? The rest has beenwill be formalities. South Africa will finish with a bonus-point win over Canada on Tuesday, and New Zealand likewise against Italy on Saturday. On Sunday, Canada and Namibia play off to see if either can break into the top 20. It will be a good game but TV ratings are expected to be modest. Meanwhile, New Zealand and South Africa must gird themselves for big quarter‑finals after a few weeks of gentle preparation. Echoes of 2007 for the All Blacks. How many words is that now?Story so far This was meant to be the toughest pool but actually it has turned into a bit of a procession, too, albeit with each match bearing the possibility at least of an upset. England have not been above criticism in any of their matches, but either their opponents have flopped disappointingly each time or England are doing better than it seems. Certainly, France have struggled to put away the same opposition with any conviction, but both teams have qualified with a game to spare.What’s still at stake? England and France face off on Saturday for the right to qualify as pool winners. Will either consider that old chestnut of the “strategic” path to the final? In other words, avoiding the All Blacks. The winners will probably play Australia in the quarters, the runners-up Wales – so much the same sort of assignment. If successful, the pool winners would then likely face the All Blacks (or Ireland?), the runners-up South Africa. Ah, but if you want to win a World Cup, you have to beat everyone, runs the counterargument. This is self‑evidently untrue. England are far less likely to be entertaining any notion of throwing Saturday’s match. They have a whiff of defiance about them. It could be South Africa who are happiest about that.Story so far The only other upset of the pool stage saw Uruguay beat Fiji. Glorious though this was, it was not the upset a neutral might have chosen. Fiji are a side packed full of first‑class talent, who many fancied to make the quarter-finals. Alas, they are now reduced to trying to throw a ner in someone else’s works (Wales’s). Otherwise, the key game in this pool was Wales-Australia, won by the former in just the sort of bloody-minded fashion they have made their own lately.What’s still at stake? Fiji may yet throw that ner on Wednesday but it would be of limited use to them. Wales finish against Uruguay on Sunday and will surely take maximum points. In which case it would be Australia who likely benefit, the Wallabies finishing with a game against Georgia on Friday. An upset there is not quite out of the question, but it would be big – of Tonga‑France-in-2011 proportions, if not quite Brighton 2015. If Wales beat Fiji (and they are currently 17-point favourites to do so) they will top the group with a win over Uruguay, which would pitch Australia into the England‑New Zealand side of the draw. Fiji look safe for third place, which would mean Georgia back on the qualification beat for 2023."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95af8183c1df77df08252f9df4d817bc80fed1b9/0_41_2426_1455/master/2426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d284a6379fbf7dd9f72eb5954e669c22","title":"andy murray set to play in australian open says tournament director","story":"Andy Murray is expected to compete in the 2020 Australian Open, according to its tournament director, Craig Tiley.The former world No 1 had career-saving hip surgery earlier this year and continued his good progress by reaching the China Open quarter-finals last week.At the 2019 Australian Open, Murray, 32, tearfully announced he may have to retire due to the pain he felt every time he played.But after he underwent a procedure to resurface his hip joint in January, the two-time Wimbledon champion could be involved in the first grand slam of the new year.“For sure Andy will be here,” Tiley told the Australian radio station Triple M on Tuesday. “I was on the phone to his agent this morning.

The women behind a new shibari show speak outA young woman is strung up above the stage, a delicate lattice of red ropes criss-crossing the bare skin on her thighs and ribs, leaving an exposed patchwork of flesh. It’s the startling opening of Everything I See I Swallow, a show that won a Fringe First at the Edinburgh festival this summer, a two-hander devised by actors and aerialists Maisy Taylor (the suspended woman) and Tamsin Shasha with director Helen Tennison.What Taylor is demonstrating is the art of shibari, the centuries-old practice of Japanese rope bondage, which began as an elaborate way for samurai to restrain their captives and has evolved into an erotic art. Your first thoughts might be: this seems like a niche interest. But it’s the spark for a piece of theatre that speaks to something universal and pressing, about the rights of women over their own bodies, the ramifications of digital life, and that knotty old question: can it ever be empowering for a woman to take her clothes off in public?Shasha plays Miranda, a woman appalled to discover her artist daughter Olivia (Taylor) has been posting semi-naked pictures of herself online. Their ensuing standoff is a primer on contemporary feminism and navigating sexuality in the internet age. That the pair have done their homework is evident (thinkers from Andrea Dworkin to Beyoncé are namechecked) and the occasionally heavy-handed script can be self-consciously learned, but the fact is it’s fascinating territory, constantly evolving and full of complexity.The pair act out an unusually frank but believable mother-daughter bond, the calm self-possession of Taylor, 25, versus the fraught energy of Shasha, 53. The aerialism is contemplative and illustrative, the umbilical attachment of mother and daughter stretching as the girl grows up, or Miranda tying herself in literal as well as figurative knots with the argument at hand. Different modes of text layer up: conventional scenes, direct address to the audience, quotes from feminist theory and naturalistic voiceovers.Taylor’s monologues are some of the most authentic-feeling sections and her character is semi-autobiographical. “It’s something I’ve been exploring in my life anyway,” she says of the show’s subject matter when we speak after a sold-out performance at London’s Jacksons Lane arts centre. “I spent three years at circus school and when I left I started working as a cabaret performer in a strip club. I was performing rope shows, mostly naked, and I was trying to explore why people have such strong views on women in sex work and women posting nude photos online. And whether that behaviour can be empowered or whether it’s always part of the problem.”Some of the things Taylor speaks about in Swallow raise important questions about how we bring up girls. As a child she was always told how pretty she was, to the point where she began to resent the assessment of a quality that seemed nothing to do with who she was. It drove her to dissociate from her body, she tells us, and the unexpected way she reconnected was through shibari, finding complete peace in deliberately giving up control.It’s a fascinating personal history, but incorporated into the show’s narrative it raises plenty of questions: Who holds the power when you put an image into the public realm? How do you manage the gap between intention and reception? After all, one person’s art may be another’s porn you may feel empowered but you can still be objectified.Olivia’s fourth-wave feminism jars with her mother’s outlook, with Miranda struggling to protect her daughter and her generation’s hard-won gains in equality. Shasha feels similarly. “But we do need to talk about these things,” she says. “I want to have that conversation. I’ve become very woke making the show.”I ask Taylor about her own mum’s reaction to what she does. “My mum’s great, she’s very supportive,” she says. Taylor’s parents were part of the new age traveller movement and very open-minded. “My family trust that I have really good reasons for doing what I’m doing,” she says. There’s a condescension towards women who are “outwardly sexual”, she thinks. “It’s, ‘They can’t possibly know what they’re doing, they need to be helped.’ And no one who knows me would ever think that.”For Taylor, all her work, whether shibari or circus or strip-club shows, is a form of research, and Swallow is a vehicle for discussion, not a conclusion. “The fact that we don’t know where we sit is part of it,” she says. “I know there’s something wrong with the sexualised imagery we see of women every day, but I don’t think the answer is to totally strip sex out of life – it won’t work. We need to normalise sexual desire and expression rather than having it as this secret everyone carries around with them and is terrified of because it’s somehow anti-feminist.”Challenging, provocative and funny, too, Swallow is a brave dissection of the intergenerational ide where the personal is undeniably political.• Everything I See I Swallow is at Arena theatre, Wolverhampton, 9 October Cornerstone Arts Centre, Didcot, 10 October and Lakeside theatre, Colchester, 6-7 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06cd580dea24ce9b26eb9b8ca36ddf588b147ca1/155_322_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e2e6db1c3d8578fa5b5eb0ba99489c7","title":"send tip small european ski resort win 200 pund hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about a favourite quieter resort in Europe with a relaxed atmosphere and some local flavourIt could be a bijou ski area tucked away in an obscure valley, an accidental find while heading off cross-country, or a less developed area with an old chairlift away from the main resort starting in a hamlet.

Nowhere more so than in the Highlands, where wild camping is legal and bothies aboundIn the dog days of summer 2016 I rode my bike from Taynuilt on Loch Etive to Findhorn on the Moray Firth using the wildest and loneliest ways I could find. Logging and estate tracks, stalkers’ paths, drovers’ and 18th-century military roads and disused railways, as well as modern cycle paths and tarmac took me from one coast of Scotland to the other. At the time, the adventure was simply an act of care for myself after months in a job I had to drive to, following decades of cycling to work. I was sad and weak as a result of hours wasted on the motorway, and waking up on 24 June to learn the result of the Brexit referendum left me needing time alone with my own country.Riding a bike on wild paths turns what might be a slog on foot into a pleasurable amble. If you’re walking for several days in Scotland, the weight of food, fuel, camping kit and bad-weather clothing can be a real barrier to enjoyment. On a bike, I let the wheels take the load and put my effort into the pedals, revelling in the simple majesty of moving myself and my essentials through the landscape. It leaves time and energy for other pursuits. I’ve packed a wetsuit in the past, for dips in remote river pools.So many people have cottoned on to this that bicycles, electronics, bags and camping kit now come in space-age designs with astronomical prices. And while some of that stuff is lovely, none of it is essential to a satisfying and safe bikepacking trip into the wild. All you need is a solid bike with chunky tyres and a means of carting ordinary camping gear: panniers, or a single-wheel trailer for longer trips. One constant is a decent map, as it’s all too easy to get carried away down the wrong forest path.Any part of my coast-to-coast route would make a great overnight bikepacking trip, but one that stands out in its versatility is the first part – up Loch Etive and into Glen Kinglass. It’s easiest to start from the right bank of the River Awe, after the A85 bridge: from here I soon plunged off the tarmac on to a forest road, leaving the scant traces of civilisation behind. The track twists and turns, dips and rises along the eastern shore of the sea loch. It never rises to more than 50 metres but does so often and steeply, and the surface is loose. I found myself working harder and progressing more slowly than expected. But so what?As I looked around I saw things that are more obvious from the saddle than on foot. After the first climb, you can pretty much see the whole sea loch stretching to the north-west. Looking down, you notice that Loch Etive is a proper Nordic fjord, a steep-sided gouge in the edge of the Grampians. Low-lying grassland is fringed with scrubby oaks and sandy bays fringed with yellow flag iris.At Ardmaddy, I turned inland up the River Kinglass, a deep, dark channel with a magnificent conical mountain in the distance: Stob Dubh, summit of Buachaille Etive Beag, overlooking the pass of Glen Coe. Heading inland, I freewheeled down to the timber bridge and paused to look over the side, hypnotised by the peaty water, eyes scouring the bed for resting Atlantic salmon.In Scotland you can camp responsibly on most open ground. The lower stretches of the Kinglass abound with perfect spots, with lush grass and the last remnants of the Atlantic temperate rainforest clinging to the foothills of the Ben Starav. I like to stretch out and feel for stones and hollows before I pitch my tent, and orient it for the best morning view. The bike goes out to pasture and the stove goes on, the lid gently chiming as water boils for pasta.But there’s another possibility in Scotland: bothies. If you ride light and don’t mind who you share a roof with, these basic shelters are free for any passerby. When I got to the one in Glen Kinglass – a cruck-framed cottage – it was deserted, so I laid my sleeping mat on the bare earth floor, effectively camping indoors – and away from the midges. The bothy is set back from the track among broadleaved woods. The crag above is cut in two by the gorge of the Allt Narrachan and reminds me of a Chinese silk painting, the diagonal of the stream flicking side to side before leaping off into a waterfall with trees on crazy ledges either side. Next day you can ride back the way you came or head on to Bridge of Orchy and Tyndrum for the train back to Taynuilt. It’s a wild trail with unbridged rivers and sketchy tracks at best. But the thing with bikepacking is that you go where you fancy and take risks and perils on the chin. It’s your choice and there are no rules. You have options that don’t make sense on foot.

Finally, some adult company! True, there is no shortage of parenting sitcoms on TV, but there are relatively few that so ruthlessly dispense with sentiment in favour of stressed-out social satire. It’s oddly soothing.There’s also no shortage of Sharon Horgan on TV, and though the prolific writerproducerperformer is only a quarter of the creative team here (Holly Walsh, Helen Linehan and Barunka O’Shaughnessy round out the writer’s room), Motherland is unmistakably Horgan-esque in its depiction of comic self-absorption. If you thought Julia (Anna Maxwell Martin) stooped low to “lean in” last series, wait till you see the lengths she goes to as a working-from-home freelancer.Julia’s harried manner – rush to school drop-off, rush to the cafe, rush to the office, rush back for pickup – sets each episodes’ frantic pace and, judging by her appearance, series-two Julia seems to have finally had the nervous breakdown that series-one Julia was forever threatening. Actually, it kind of suits her. Combined with the right amount of “sod the patriarchy” swagger, dirty joggers, purple furry coat and unbrushed hair can be a certified look. Don’t expect everyone to get it, though. “You all right?” asks Liz (Diane Morgan) as Julia slumps down at their usual cafe table. “You look like a mental patient.”Ah, Liz. For all that Motherland innovates in the field of onscreen mum representation, Liz hails from that older sitcom tradition of take-no-crap heroes, stretching back to Roseanne via Lois from Malcolm in the Middle and the gone-too-soon Della in Raised By Wolves. Liz’s one-liners should be compiled into a how-to manual and handed out to all new parents. Wisdom such as: “Life’s too short to dick about with aubergines” and: “You wait till he gets on Tinder see how much of a co-parent he is then” cannot be allowed to pass us by in a flurry of farce.Yet it’s Julia, not Liz, who gets the most screen time and is presumably intended as the most relatable. In the American high-school cafeteria that is the mums’ favourite local cafe, Julia is huddled at a too-small, toilet-adjacent table with her fellow misfits, while Amanda (Lucy Punch) heads up the Mean Girls in a superior spot. Into that finely balanced hierarchy, series two introduces a new character, Meg (played by Tanya Moodie), a high-flying business exec with five kids who still finds time to party hearty (“That one has a fridge full of Yops and Red Bulls,” observes Liz sagely. “It’s a classic 90s comedown concoction.”)Meg is the manifestation of Julia’s “having it all” anxiety and therefore less a fully rounded character, more an awestruck Forbes magazine profile. Hopefully, we will get to know Meg better in the already-commissioned third series, just as this series has gifted soggy stay-at-home dad Kevin (Paul Ready) with a believable backbone. For now, though, her introduction could read like a panicked attempt to pre-empt criticism – the Motherland version of Donald Glover’s season-two Girls cameo. And to what end? This is still a sitcom by white middle-class mums, about white middle-class mums.Let other sitcoms skewer other postcodes. Motherland doesn’t realistically reflect the ersity of a typical London state primary, but it does do a terrific job at satirising one specific stratum of school-gate society. It’s a world in which allegiances are fast-shifting. The misfit mums’ camaraderie often tips far enough towards smug to make you side with their enemies, and Julia’s gobsmacking selfishness and capacity to exploit others can make Amanda’s villainy seem redundant. All of which is true to the general fallibility of humans who happen to have children, not to mention hilarious.It’s common sense, really, the observation that stress doesn’t typically transform people into selfless saints. But the show’s insight goes deeper and darker still. Are these people all really friends? Or are they, as Kevin worries, “just friendly”? Are the other mothers just life rafts Julia will cling to until she reaches the safe shore of her youngest child’s 18th birthday, when they will be hastily discarded?Motherland probably won’t still be on air then, but it could be. From Kevin’s Brexit picture book to the yummy-mummification of the high street and dick pic etiquette for single parents, there’s an abundance of storylines here, enough to fill 20 series. High school has given us great television as varied as The Inbetweeners and Buffy the Vampire Slayer why should this equally intense life stage be any less of an inspiration?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb0f0286d8e0fcb0beee9e282b86bd5b92f164a2/66_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85b6880f54d91c7ee4f5c647fa9ec8cc","title":"we good now china south park creators issue mock apology after show reportedly censored","story":"Facetious statement comes after reports that show was banned in China after episode critical of the countrySouth Park’s creators have responded with a mock apology to reports that China has censored the programme, ridiculing the country and comparing President Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh.The “apology” from Trey Parker and Matt Stone comes after reports on Monday that China had scrubbed all episodes, clips and content related to the long-running comedy cartoon from Chinese streaming and social media platforms in response to a recent episode that was critical of the country.The episode, called Band in China, took aim at what it portrayed as a tendency in US culture to adjust content to accommodate Chinese censorship laws. “It’s not worth living in a world where China controls my country’s art,” says one character in the episode.The episode also includes a plot line in which a character is caught selling drugs in China and as punishment is sent to a work camp, similar to the mass internment camps in Xinjiang where an estimated one million people, including Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are detained.South Park’s creators posted a statement on Twitter under the headline: “Official apology to China from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, which said: “Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts.”The NBA has been in damage control this week after Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, expressed support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in a now-deleted tweet. The NBA distanced itself from Morey’s position in response to complaints from NBA sponsors in China and Chinese media companies refusing to broadcast Rockets games.“We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn’t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all,” the statement continued, referring to China’s ban on the AA Milne character, after widespread circulation of memes comparing China’s president Xi Jinping to the honey-loving teddy bear.The statement continued: “Tune in to our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10!

It would also bring back a tradition that dates back to the late 19th century, when the East River was dotted with free public floating baths, until pollution led to their demise in the 1930s.The New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) has put out a call for people “interested in developing, installing, and operating a self-filtering swim facility to be located in the East River off lower Manhattan”.Among the organisations planning to submit a proposal is not-for-profit +Pool, which has created a design for what it believes is the world’s first water-filtering floating pool.The concept was first conceived nearly nine years ago by a group of artists and architects. The plus-sign shaped, 9,000 sq ft design has four separate sections for sports, relaxing, laps and children that can also be combined to form an Olympic length pool.Its chlorine-free filter system pushes river water through the walls of the pool, acting as a “giant strainer” that removes bacteria, odours and contaminants without removing the water’s salt content, and pushes clean water out. The organisation estimates the system can clean over 600,000 gallons of water per day.Kara Meyer, the managing director of +Pool, said: “Swimming in natural water is a totally different experience. To be able to do it in such an iconic city like New York city is life-changing.”+Pool has been working on this idea and advocating for it since 2010 – gaining widespread publicity in the process. Last month NYCEDC put out a “request for expressions of interest”, inviting interested parties to come forward with proposals by 1 November . Proposals have to demonstrate how the project would provide long-term access to the public to swim in the river, benefit the local community, how the filtration system would work and how they will finance construction, installation and running costs without funding from NYCEDC or the city.While the request marks a significant step in the project, there are still many hurdles to overcome. The party that is chosen for the project will then enter into a “predevelopment agreement” when they will need to present their design and get all the necessary federal, state and city approvals and permits before construction can start.Although the Clean Water Act has led to a vast improvement in the water quality of New York Harbour – “no one in our lifetime has seen it as clean and healthy”, according to the 2018 Harbour Water Quality Report, and there has been an increase in whale sightings – it still has an image problem.“There’s a huge negative public perception on the waters around New York. There have been for quite some time. So a lot of the work that we’ve been doing as an educational organisation is just to share that that’s not necessarily true,” added Meyer.According to early estimates, +Pool would cost $20m to create, funds which it plans to raise privately, and one year to build. Last week it launched a light installation in the river to indicate cleanliness that links to an online water quality “dashboard”.The project reflects New Yorkers’ changing relationship with its waterways in recent years. The city has moved to improve access including waterfront parks and launched a citywide ferry service.Allison Dees, the NYCEDC assistant vice-president, said: “We are excited to be examining the feasibility of a floating swimming facility in New York’s harbour, as it will promote a sustainable approach to enjoying our rivers and further activate our waterfront for the enjoyment of New Yorkers in a creative way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48478c209a7d81a3f58b3f212071df9cc80b5e84/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b147799f46e40587b8c5df594c35df5","title":"from emperors to inventors the unsung heroes to celebrate in black history month","story":"Black academics and cultural commentators pick eight watershed moments and fearless people we should be remembering this monthIn 1926, the US historian Carter G Woodson, the son of former slaves, launched Negro History Week to commemorate important people and events from the African diaspora. “If a race has no history,” he said, “it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated.” Renamed and expanded in the 1970s, what we now know as Black History Month has been celebrated in the UK since 1987.Founded by Akyaaba Addai-Sebo, the first Black History Month in the UK was\u0026nbspcelebrated in October 1987. He conceived it as an annual celebration of the contributions of Africa, Africans and people of African descent to world civilisation from antiquity to the present.It took its cue from the established Black History Month that had taken\u0026nbsp place in the US every February since it was first adopted by staff and students at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970, and which had built into a national movement.Its origins go back to 1926, when the second week in February was designated as a week to celebrate and discuss African-Americans\u0027 contribution to history.One of the key reasons for starting Black History Month in the UK was the under-representation of BAME people in the mainstream British history taught in schools, and to ensure that the history and heritage of the African diaspora was preserved and celebrated.This year, as every year, the focus will be on pivotal and well-documented figures such as Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman. But there are others whose often radical work is frequently forgotten. In an effort to honour at least some of them, we asked black historians and cultural figures to nominate their own heroes and watershed events.Wedderburn was a 19th-century political firebrand, who was so powerful that he was put on a secret British government list of potentially dangerous reformers. He pushed for the end of slavery and the redistribution of wealth in Britain, publishing a book, The Horrors of Slavery, in 1824 and being arrested multiple times for his activism, which was considered “blasphemous”. He was controversial, but he was also part of a posse of people of colour who were all radical not only defending themselves, but trying to uplift all marginalised people.He was a real revolutionary, and I have no idea why he has been forgotten. People can learn from him today because he stood up to the government of the day in a form of radical rhetoric that challenged his environment. He spoke truth to power. He wanted the government to be egalitarian, and he wasn’t just looking out for black people. In today’s terms, we would call him intersectional, but he was doing that back then and focusing on people’s dignity, advocating for it from the pulpit and in print.Kwame Kwei-Armah is the artistic director of the Young VicSeptimius Severus, born in what is now Libya in 145, was the first black Roman emperor. His reign came after Marcus Aurelius, and he began what is seen as the last dynasty of the empire: the Severan dynasty. He was known for being a ruthless military leader, but is not well remembered, perhaps because of his race and because he has been overshadowed by flamboyant emperors such as Caesar and Nero.There can be a dichotomy in black history – you are either the hero or the victim – yet here is someone who was immensely powerful and privileged, and an uncompromising man of his time.When you think of the Roman empire, you never think of someone who was born in northern Africa, yet the empire was so vast that it sprawled beyond what we now call the west. There wasn’t as much of a rigid boundary between the continents then that is a mere hierarchy we have since developed. Through Severus, we can see that those boundaries are artificial and that people of African descent held positions of great power throughout history.Olivette Otele is a professor of history at Bath Spa UniversityThere was a pivotal moment in my life, and in British life, in 1975 when a group of black mothers in Lewisham, south-east London, got together to campaign against the “sus” law that gave police the power to arrest anyone they suspected was loitering with intent to commit certain offences. This power was disproportionately used against young black men. One Tuesday night in February, these women came together and simply said “no”. They wanted to save their sons, and from that grew a whole movement.I was a trainee lawyer at the time, and they came to me to ask for help. The campaign grew to involve churches and all the political parties and trade unions, until in 1980 it went before a home affairs select committee and it was finally recommended that the law be repealed.It was a landmark for me in the history of black organisations in Britain. There is never any substitute for grassroots activism and organising. Power concedes nothing without a demand it never has and it never will.Paul Boateng is a Labour peer and former cabinet ministerThe Haitian revolution of 1791 to 1804 is the only successful slave rebellion in history. Part of the reason for its success is that it brought together all the enslaved people in the country. That was cemented through a Vodou ceremony on the night of 21 August 1791 at Bois Caïman, at which those present took an oath to take revenge on their French masters.One of the things slavery did was to get rid of the African-ness of the enslaved – they would take away their names, and slaves weren’t allowed to mix with each other, speak their original language or keep their original religion. Many of the slaves in Haiti were African-born, so taking part in this ceremony, led by the high priest Dutty Boukman and priestess Cécile Fatiman, gave them licence to retain their traditions.Vodou has its roots in the tribal religions of West Africa, and these slaves had brought them to Haiti to form the cultural practices of Vodou that we know today. It was empowering, and ultimately led them to revolt. Figures such as Toussaint L’Ouverture are remembered as the leaders, yet this grassroots African spirituality was equally important.We now have a misguided aversion to Vodou, a concept that it is witchcraft, but this is the spiritual belief of an entire people, and it shouldn’t be denigrated. Being aware of your traditions and heritage is really important. It’s not witchcraft – it’s about connecting with African roots and keeping that alive.Kehinde Andrews is a professor of black studies at Birmingham UniversityI grew up hearing a lot about Claudia Jones, who died in 1964 when I was 10. My parents would tell me how she had founded the Caribbean carnival, the precursor to Notting Hill carnival.But that was not the important thing for me. Instead, it was that, throughout her political activism, first as a black feminist leader in the Communist party in the US in the 1940s and then as a communist activist in Britain after being deported in 1955, she always spoke fearlessly about the women’s struggle.She really made the connections between race, gender and class – she was intersectional before that was really understood as a term. She was in a party dominated by men, and she was front and centre arguing about the need not only for working-class representation, but also for women’s inclusion and for people of colour.The other thing that resonates is that she was born in the Caribbean and then went to the US before coming to Britain, and so her life represents the African diaspora. She arrived in Britain at the height of Windrush racism in the mid-50s and fought to oppose the restrictions on Commonwealth citizens coming to Britain. The fact that Commonwealth people who have spent most of their lives in Britain are still being deported today, as in the Windrush scandal, is something that she would have been disgusted by. Hers is a legacy we must remember and continue to emulate.Valerie Amos is the director of Soas University of LondonGeorge Washington Carver was an inventor and agricultural scientist whose work in the early 20th century ultimately gave us peanut butter as well as 300 other products derived from peanuts, including soaps, flour and insulation. He gave it all away, dedicating his patents to the American people.He is no different to other achievers of African American descent who have not been given their due space and place in history. I was contacted in 2004 by English Heritage it had only 15 plaques to people of colour in England. That is why we started the blue plaque campaign to have people of black descent recognised. In the years since, we have put up more than 50, as well as two statues – one of which is a memorial in Windrush Square in Brixton to the African-Caribbean soldiers who fought in the first and second world wars.When you memorialise historic locations, and people such as Carver, you celebrate our common heritage. People should be more aware of who we live among and our shared histories.Jak Beula is the founder of the Nubian Jak Community TrustAlice Kinloch was a South African activist who came to Britain in the late 1890s and helped to found the African Association, although that is usually credited to a man, Henry Sylvester-Williams. The African Association convened the First Pan-African Conference, which was held in London in 1900. This was the first major event to use the term pan-African and to gather people from all over the diaspora to speak with one voice.Kinloch has been written out of history, and not much is known about her – I have never even seen a picture of her – but she played a leading role at a time when few African women were active in politics in Britain or elsewhere.Hakim Adi is a professor of the history of Africa and the African diaspora at the University of ChichesterGeorge William Gordon was hanged after the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865, when hundreds of Jamaicans protested against the abject poverty of colonial rule. A mixed-race Jamaican and a British subject, Gordon was accused of having planned the rebellion, although his only “crime” was to speak out against planter rule and colonial misgovernance.His swift hanging caused a huge controversy in Britain. He became a martyr around whom there emerged the first rumblings of solidarity across race lines. There were working-class meetings around the country to commemorate his death and to organise protests. People even held mock funerals for him and argued that although he was a different colour, he was still an Englishman, and that anyone could become a target of the empire.Priyamvada Gopal is a reader in Anglophone and related literature at the University of Cambridge"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da0c308acc9bbd1a7e9793d4c7ac04eaa70eaac/510_0_2946_1767/master/2946.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c3d8fe56a166e8139ed405b091ad594","title":"new zealand wrestles with 250th anniversary of james cooks arrival","story":"Replica of the Endeavour sails coastline as part of flotilla that has been met with a mix of celebration and griefA replica of Captain James Cook’s Endeavour has docked in Gisborne 250 years after the British navigator landed in New Zealand and named the cove he first sighted Poverty Bay.The replica is part of a flotilla, known as Tuia 250, that has been sailing around New Zealand on a taxpayer-funded voyage in memory of Cook’s arrival in New Zealand.Dame Jenny Shipley, who is co-chair of Tuia 250, acknowledged that for many indigenous New Zealanders the commemoration celebrations are tinged with grief, as nine Māori lost their lives in the first encounter with Cook and his men, and eventually the Māori people lost their sovereignty.“I’ve been very proud of both Māori and Pākehā, the way they’ve come to this and rather than arguing the facts of history, have tried to explore the emotions that it’s evoked and that’s been the experience here this week,” she said.“It’s quite right that 250 years on some people are really proud and want to move on, they see this as a huge contribution to society, others see it as a tragic intervention.“It is not a bad thing if people want to express their differences and New Zealanders are ready to grow up and do that,” Shipley said as she welcomed the Endeavour into port.“If there are protests, of course they’re entitled to express their view, but I can tell you there are many in both of the iwi who also want to move forward and there’s got to be space for everybody.”Some iwi – tribal Māori – have opposed the commemoration celebrations, and said that spending taxpayer money marking the colonisation of Māori land is wrong.At least one town banned the ship from docking after an outcry from the local Māori community.Ten thousand people gathered in Gisborne to welcome the ship but the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was noticeably absent. She was meeting with the visiting Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte.Ardern told RNZ that it was important New Zealanders faced up to uncomfortable realities around Cook’s arrival in New Zealand, and she had already spent two days in Gisborne over the weekend. Ardern said her decision not to attend today’s commemoration should not be read as political move. “There are things that need to be talked about when we talk about the 250th anniversary. Never before has the story fully been told of the loss of life when Cook arrived,” Ardern said.“This is the chance to talk about the reality of New Zealand’s history, to acknowledge it, to be open about it. That might attract some protests but that is all part of the conversation.”People in Gisborne expressed mixed emotions about the arrival of the replica Endeavour.“He killed some of our ancestors.

CTF staff members worked closely with Tory MPs – including some current ministers – to undermine Theresa May’s Brexit deal, while several senior employees took leave to run Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign. has exposed CTF’s work on campaigns for the Saudi Arabian government, major fossil fuel producers, anti-cycling campaigners, tobacco firms and sugary drinks producers. Now the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists has used, for only the fourth time, its powers to formally demand CTF Partners provide detailed evidence that the aims of such clients did not influence staff’s unpaid work with politicians including the PM. Crosby’s company has denied claims it could have broken the law, insisting senior employees’ decision to volunteer on Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign was unconnected with their day jobs. But the investigation could be an incentive for Downing Street to keep Johnson away from his longtime political adviser Crosby. There are reports the pair have fallen out, with Johnson turning instead to his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his own partner, Carrie Symonds.Trump isolated amid Syria chaos – The Turkish defence ministry has declared “all preparations for a possible military operation into north-eastern Syria are completed”, as Donald Trump faces a political backlash from close Republican allies after his decision to withdraw forces from the countries’ border. The president is accused of betraying Kurdish fighters who led the defeat of Isis and leaving them to face a potential Turkish invasion alone. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have said the fate of tens of thousands of suspected Islamic State fighters and their families in its custody is uncertain. It is unclear if Turkey would take custody of them. In Washington the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said: “A precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.” The Republican senator and Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham said: “This decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran and Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys.”Brexit debt warning – Emergency tax cuts and higher public spending needed to offset a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level in more than half a century and could end up forcing a new wave of austerity cuts even as the government moves to increases funding for healthcare, schools and police, according to Britain’s leading experts on the public finances.

They included Sarah Lasenby, an 81-year-old retired social worker from Oxford, and Phil Kingston, 83, who was arrested at the Treasury for spray-painting “Life, not death for my grandchildren” in red.Outside the MoD, activists attached themselves to cars before being removed by police using buzzsaws. Officers removed a man who had attached himself to a tipi frame on Westminster Bridge, while others who had glued themselves to scaffolding in Trafalgar Square were taken away. Boris Johnson derided the protesters as “uncooperative crusties” who should stop blocking the streets of the capital with their “heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs”. At the launch of a  editor’s book about Margaret Thatcher, the PM reportedly taunted protesters that his predecessor had cared about greenhouse gases before they did.Celebration and grief – A touring replica of Captain James Cook’s Endeavour has docked in Gisborne 250 years after the British navigator landed in New Zealand and named the cove he first sighted Poverty Bay.

It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Based on this advice, the department believes the issue is confined to the senders’ email”. It acknowledged that the committees had attempted to apply before the deadline and have informed them that arrangements are being made for the six locations to be visited.The six committees have welcomed the decision and the department said “the adjudicators, in formulating their reports, will be mindful of the fact that their assessments are taking place in October, rather than during the summer months”. If there are any prizewinners among the six they will be presented at the regional awards ceremonies later this year.“If, as a result of the adjudications which are now to be undertaken, a medal is awarded to any of the towns affected it will not displace any existing medal winners that have already been announced,” as there are multiple medal winners who reach the required standard."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Will new Mona Lisa queuing system in restored Louvre gallery bring a smile back to visitors\u0026#39 faces?Comment: Donald Trump has abandoned Syria for short-term political gain.

According to less timely official data, online sales have been growing strongly compared with 2018 until at least August, the last month covered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).“Ongoing Brexit uncertainty is clearly having a material impact on the consumer psyche,” said\u0026nbspPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, agreed, noting that many consumers held off from non-essential purchases or shopped\u0026nbsparound for bigger discounts.

However, year-on-year growth in retail sales has slowed sharply from a peak in March to stand at 2.7 per cent in August,\u0026nbspaccording to data.On the less volatile three-month measure, retail sales inched up only 0.6 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, the ONS said.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means.

Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHMystify: Michael Hutchence features previously unseen footage of the pair relaxing on a yacht and holidaying in Europe and Hong Kong in the early Nineties. at one point Minogue recalls\u0026nbspHutchence’s creative genius but also his extreme mood swings\u0026nbspduring their time together.The film is directed by long-time INXS artistic collaborator Richard Lowenstein, who Hutchence once described in an interview as his best friend, before adding: “I don’t think he knows it.”Mystify: Michael Hutchence is released in the UK on 18 October, with nationwide previews and a live Q\u0026ampA in cinemas on 16 October.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t.

She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.In 2018, pictures of Winne the Pooh were blocked in China after people began to compare him to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.\u0026nbsp“Some people say Pooh looks like the Chinese president, so we’re illegal in China now,” Piglet explains.\u0026nbsp“What kind of madhouse is this?” asks Randy.\u0026nbspSince the episode aired in the US, searches for\u0026nbspSouth Park\u0026nbspon the Chinese website Weibo shows “no relevant results have been found”.

Jed Foster, 20, has appeared at Reading Magristrates\u0027 Court where denied any involvement with the murderA fire that broke out at the site of Village Bakery on Coed Aben Road, Wrexham Industrial Estate in WalesIn recent weeks, the party has seen its ranks swollen by the arrival of ex-Tories Sarah Wollaston, Sam Gyimah and Phillip Lee as well as Chuka Umunna, Angela Smith and Luciana Berger, previously of Labour. Ms Allen’s arrival brings the Lib Dem tally in the Commons to 19.Ms Swinson said she was “in discussions” with potential switchers and “always hopeful of further defections”, but declined to say whether new recruits were in the pipeline.And Ms Allen, who has been sitting as an independent since quitting Change UK in June,\u0026nbspsaid she was “absolutely” in touch with serving Tory MPs who shared her concerns over the direction the party was taking under Mr Johnson.“I’m not saying everybody should casually resign the whip, but for me it was the right thing and I know that in other MPs’ hearts they know it’s the right thing to do,” she said. “There has got to be at least 20.”Asked if she expected any to follow her, she replied: “I couldn’t say for sure that any will. I’d like to say yes, but one of the things that’s disappointed me most since I became an MP is the lack of bravery that there is.”Liberal Democrats to stand aside in seat of ex-Tory Dominic GrieveLib Dems will halt Brexit ‘on day one’ if they win election – SwinsonCan the Liberal Democrats turn momentum into votes?New Liberal Democrat MP says she expects other MPs to defectMs Swinson said she had been working with her new MP for “a long time” on issues like the campaign for a Final Say referendum, and the pair have been “in close contact” over a possible defection since\u0026nbspMs Allen left Change.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His approach is to attack the Labour heartlands instead. But you win elections on the centre ground.”AFPGetty)Ms Allen was marked out as an independent voice on the Tories’ centrist wing from her maiden speech in the Commons, when she was critical of the party’s approach to welfare – something she admits “probably limited my opportunities for promotion”.A former entrepreneur, who put her business on hold to enter politics, said she was attracted by the compassionate and pro-business agenda pursued by the coalition government under David Cameron.“The Conservative Party since then has changed beyond recognition,” she said.“I don’t see that I have changed at all, it is the party that has changed irreparably. The party that I joined doesn’t exist any more. It is self-imploding, it is turning into the new Brexit Party.”And she said it was a “very, very risky” question whether the Conservative Party would even survive its current traumas.“The loud, bullying voices of the European Research Group have been allowed to capture the party and push it to the precipice of a no-deal Brexit, which would be unbelievably damaging for our economy, our society and our Union.\u0026nbspAnybody who shares ‘One Nation’\u0026nbspvalues does not have a home there any more.”By contrast, she said the Lib Dems under Ms Swinson offer “an incredibly positive beacon for what our future could be”, not only on Brexit, but also social justice, compassionate welfare and honesty over spending on the NHS and social care.Ms Allen’s defection was announced hours after the latest talks between opposition leaders seeking a means to prevent no-deal Brexit broke-up without progress on the key issue of the leadership of a possible caretaker government to extend Article 50 talks.Ms Swinson said there were still “constructive” discussions happening, but said that if Labour stuck to its position that only Jeremy Corbyn could head a temporary caretaker administration, then “it won’t happen because we know what the numbers are of people unwilling to back him – not just Liberal Democrats but also rebel Conservatives and the increasingly large number of MPs who have left Labour or are still in the Labour Party but cannot contemplate Corbyn in No 10”.This is not Jennifer Arcuri\u0027s scandal, it is Boris Johnson\u0027sThe Lib\u0026nbspDem\u0026nbspleader said she could name “a dozen”\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho could fill the role of caretaker PM, but said this was only one of a number of routes open to those opposing no deal.Progress on issues like the\u0026nbspBenn\u0026nbspAct, to prevent Mr Johnson opting for no deal without parliamentary approval, had been made not in meetings of opposition leaders but in a wider group including rebel Tories and Labour backbenchers, she pointed out.Stressing that the Lib\u0026nbspDem\u0026nbspdoor remains open to future defectors, Ms\u0026nbspSwinson\u0026nbspsaid: “It remains the case that there are lots of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho are unhappy with the current direction of both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and who share our values of internationals and a fairer and more inclusive society and want to stop Brexit and create a more positive future for our country.“Obviously, I hope more of them will be joining us, but these things happen in their own time.”Asked if she was actively talking with potential defectors, she replied: “I’m always in discussions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

According to less timely official data, online sales have been growing strongly compared with 2018 until at least August, the last month covered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).“Ongoing Brexit uncertainty is clearly having a material impact on the consumer psyche,” said\u0026nbspPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, agreed, noting that many consumers held off from non-essential purchases or shopped\u0026nbsparound for bigger discounts. Out of 13 product categories in the BRC figures, only sales of food and household appliances showed growth on either measure.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesDemand for new ranges of autumn clothing was also dented by warm weather in September, Ms Dickinson said.“With four months of negative sales growth since March, the ongoing political gridlock surrounding Brexit is harming both consumers and retailers,” she added.“Clarity is needed over our future trading relationship with our closest neighbours, and it is vitally important that Britain does not leave the EU without a deal.”Retail sales and broader consumer spending have been a bright spot in an otherwise fragile UK economy this year. However, year-on-year growth in retail sales has slowed sharply from a peak in March to stand at 2.7 per cent in August,\u0026nbspaccording to data.On the less volatile three-month measure, retail sales inched up only 0.6 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, the ONS said. That was only a slight improvement on July’s 0.5 per cent rise, which was the weakest increase since December.The BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor covered five weeks between 25 August and 28 September.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As we are all too aware, their triumph has been overshadowed by a decision to take legal action against The Mail on Sunday over a story that everyone but them had forgotten about and with every chance they might lose.Whoever happens to be right or wrong, I find the situation desperately sad.Meghan and her dad could end up having to face each other in court. It would be the sort of ghastly media circus Harry wants to protect her from. It should never have been allowed to get so out of hand.I believe that they need to think long and hard about what they want for their future happiness and that of their baby son. It would be a huge decision to walk away from public le and become plain Mr and Mrs Windsor, but it may be for the best.I am well aware it’s a dficult one. As new parents, they want to make the world a better place for their baby. They are in a uniquely privileged position to do an incredible amount of good.But we have Harry confessing he finds it tough to get out of bed in the morning and revealing that Meghan has been left bruised and battered by criticism in newspapers and magazines, and presumably by online trolls.So I reckon they need to do some serious soul-searching and ask themselves whether the wounding criticism outweighs the potential for making a dference.I think even Harry would agree that it would be unrealistic of them to expect the kind of North Korean fawning press enjoyed by Kim Jong-un.If they make mistakes they will be called out, and they have made some howlers.Flying on private jets while scolding the rest of us about our carbon footprint is not a good look.“Do as I say and not as I do” muddies the waters and dilutes their good intentions.I do sympathise with Meghan. It must have been upsetting to see a private letter she sent to her father appear in print.But we are told that a desperate Thomas Markle gave itto the newspaper concerned, presumably as some sort of misguided attempt to make contact with his estranged daughter.There’s no denying Thomas has been an idiot, with set-up paparazzi photos, plus interviews bemoaning he has lost touch with Meghan. Every time he opens his mouth, the gulf between them grows wider. Harry hasn’t even met his father-in-law. Even the birth of Archie didn’t heal the rt.If Harry’s mum was alive it would all have been very dferent. Canny Diana would have dazzled Thomas and welcomed him to the family. She would have protected her son and burnished the Meghan and Harry fairytale.Harry mentions his mum in the statement he made justying the decision to take legal action, and he is absolutely spot on about how she was pursued and hounded.It should be pointed out, however, that it was foreign paparazzi out to make a fast buck who pursued her on the night she died. The accident was fatal because she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and the driver of her car was drunk.Harry must realise that his wonderful Invictus Games and important work highlighting mental health would not be as le-changing or effectivethe media wasn’t there to cover the events.I understand why he is angry. He is protective of his we and finds it unbearable to see her upset.Like most people in the public eye, I have been subjected to deeply distressing and inaccurate media coverage, although nothing remotely on the scale suffered by members of the Royal Family.It’s tempting to hit back, but I’ve always thought it comes with the territory, andyou and those you care about know the truth that’s all that matters.Harry and Meghan are rich enough in their own right to live extremely comfortablythey gave up being royals.They could freely live anywhere in the world and Archie could grow up without any media scrutiny.If they don’t care about the fame and being “celebrities” then surely it’s a no-brainer.It would be a real shame as they have such a lot to offer but no one wants them to be miserable or even resentful.They’ve a whole lot of thinking to do.Since I turned  my mantra has been “a little bit of what you fancy does you good”.In the past decade I haven’t denied myself anythingand as a result have never felt healthier.All things in moderation hasn’t let me down yet and there really is nothing like a bacon roll slathered in butter with a fried egg on top. Unless it is a juicy steak washed down with a very large glass of red.As long as you aren’t ­having deep-fried lard three times a day then I say go for it – and ignore the faddy-food police.AMID the posturing, the bickering, the juvenile name-calling and the sheer ineptitude of our Parliament, there was one shining moment of clarity and authenticity this week.It came in the shape of Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who bravely stood up in the House of Commons and spoke about her own experience during a debate on the domestic abuse bill.It was honest, deeply moving and extremely important.Rosie is an admirable, decent person who articulated not only her own experiences, but also those who have no voice and who might not have bruises but are bleeding inside.She spoke about how abusers seek power and how they control their victims.It left fellow MPs in tears and reminded all of them that there is a hell of a lot more to do than just resolving bloody Brexit.Rosie is the sort of MP we deserve, andthis bill doesn’t go through it will be a national disgrace.I only wish there were more politicians like her.I HAVE been banging on about how deliciously seductive Sky Atlantic’s Succession is since it first burst on to our screens last year, and it looks like everyone  is now catching up.Our own Brian Cox is superb as Logan Roy, the ruthless billionaire who refuses to name the heir to his multinational business.Everyone is hideous, devious, ghastly and selfish, and the whole thing is compulsively addictive, right from the jarring theme tune to the end-of-episode clfhanger.It’s a bit like a really twisted King Lear, and Cox has never been better.This week the whole episode was dedicated to my adopted city of Dundee and the clan descended there from their NY base to “honour” Logan Roy.I was beyond excited to see Dundee University, the Discovery ship and the newly opened VA featured in this glossy, snarky American drama.Only one bum note.Logan’s hideous son Roman tries to wriggle into his father’s good books by buying him a Scottish football team.He merely incurs his wrath by purchasing deadly rivals Hearts instead of Hibs. It would have been far more effectivethe little weasel had bought my beloved Dundee United instead of Hearts.In real le, Cox is a massive Dundee fan and that would have been a wonderful nod to art imitating real le.BIG congrats to Westle’s Mark Feehily and his fiancé Cailean O’Neill, who welcomed their baby girl into the world this week.Mark was always the quiet one in the band, partly because he wasn’t able to talk about being gay when Westle were packaged as heart-throbs for teenage girls.Mark and Cailean have described themselves as “the happiest dads in the world”.I’m delighted Mark found his soulmate and that they’ve started a family together. I wish them all the very best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only six balls remain to be played with Britain’s star batsman standing at the crease — Boris Johnson.England’s World Cup triumph was achieved against the odds and so the passage of our nation towards Brexit has been a slog.However, the PM, unflappable and unflinching in the face of sledging from all sides, has been transformative in reshaping our fortunes.Now he stands before us with something the doubters, despoilers and delayers thought he could never achieve — a workable proposal that both delivers on the referendum and takes into account the legitimate concerns on the Irish border.Under Boris’s deal the UK would leave the EU’s customs union and the single market.It would restore the supremacy of British law over EU law and free the country from the intrusion of the meddling European Court of Justice.It would allow free trade deals to be agreed with friends and partners across the world, reinvigorating global relationships with allies old and new.It would end the payment of vast sums of hard-earned taxpayers’ money and deliver the Brexit that the British people were promised.MPs across Parliament are already starting to show that they are prepared to put partisan dferences to one side to unite behind the deal.Now it is time for the rest of the EU to do the same, to put an end to the toing and froing, the talks and the emergency summits, the snail filled — and snail-paced — diplomatic dinners and take the path out of this cul-de-sac which has now been cleared for them by Boris Johnson.We stand on the brink of an historic month, where all sides have the chance to prove they can put statecraft above squabbling, consensus above conflict, and diplomacy above ision.

Many families in inquests say they feel like the odds are stacked against them - in this case you could not have a starker example.As well as dealing with grief the family have been dealing with a lack of funding, they have no legal aid.  It’s an extremely regrettable situation. When the inquest opened - and was adjourned - in May, it was told that empty morphine tablets were discovered near Mr Dymonds body.He had told his landlady that the Jeremy Kyle episode, which has never been broadcast, didnt go well.Det. Sgt Marcus Mills told the Coroner that Mr Dymonds death was a suspected suicide.There were no signs of foul play.A further inquest review is due to take place on November , while the full inquest is scheduled to begin on April  , and last four days.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on  , or visit Mind’s website. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: “I’d seen a few seals, even some dolphins but never a whale in the Thames.”Tim Piles, , of Greenhithe, said: “I’ve been on a boat to see whales — you don’t expect it here.”Experts said there was hope that it is healthy, as it is ing and surfacing in the ­normal way, every five minutes.Julia Cable, from British Divers Marine Le Rescue, said: “We hope it will not be staying in the river for long although there is ample food.“It’s come from the Channel or North Sea and could have had navigational problems.”: A bottlenose whale, nicknamed Whaley caused hysteria in London when she swam upstream for three days.

Not that any of the judges did him the favour of spelling out the truth. They don’t seem to do that on BGT: The Champions. What they get instead is OTT praise and  hope.Absolutely the oddest thing they did, though, during Saturday’s final, just before Cowell teed up daredevil Bello Nock as “certiably insane”, was getting Ant  Dec to introduce Britain Get Talking, an ITV mental wellness campaign sparked, apparently, by a “ per cent rise in anxiety and depression”.To counter that trend, proceedings were halted and replaced by an awkward silence inside Wembley Arena, so that viewers could communicate with their nearest and dearest, as they probably would’ve done during the following ad break anyway.Opinions on this stunt will, I realise, y wildly. Given there’s no shortage of shows dealing with mental health issues, though, it just looked to me like BGT had jumped on board the virtue-signalling bandwagon.It also flew in the face of light entertainment’s real purpose, to lt the human spirit and remove you from le’s harsh realities for a minute or two.The audience understands thisonly too well, and that’s why Saturday’s top two places were filled by acts who offered no sob stories, just entertainment.Twist And Pulse deservedly won and got the BGT trophy.

The Feast of WeeksShavuot is celebrated seven days after the second Passover seder and is one of the three pilgrimage festivals.It is an ancient grain harvest festival but also identied with Biblical times with the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai.Traditionally, dairy foods are eaten at this time.The Book of Ruth is read.Shabbat means seventh, and comes at the end of the Jewish week every Saturday.The weekly festival is so central to Jewish le that the term shomer Shabbatis synonymous with religious Jews.The day of rest begins on Friday at sunset and ends on the following evening.Its foundations lie in the Book of Genesis, when God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh.The Torah instructs that no work should be done and no fires kindled on the holy day.Greenery and flowers are often used to decorate homes during Shavuot because Mount Sinai was thought to have burst into bloom in anticipation of God’s words.This is the Jewish New Year, when Jews believe God will decide what happens in the year ahead.Rosh Hashanah is the first of the High Holidays or Yamim Noraim, celebrated ten days before Yom Kippur.It is observed on the first two days of Tishrei, the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar.The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah , literally day [of] shouting blasting.The festival is celebrated with praying in the synagogue, personal reflection, and sounding the shofar - an ancient musical horn typically made of a rams horn.This is the most sacred day of the Jewish calendar.It comes after ten Days of Repentance or Days of Awe, the period between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.Meaning Day of Atonement, the festival is designed to reflect on the past year and for observers to ask for Gods forgiveness.Jewish people tend to fast for  hours, and abstain from sex, bathing and the wearing of any make-up or perfume.Many will wear white as a symbol of purity, and are forbidden from wearing leather shoes.Yom Kippur is the only day of the Jewish calendar when synagogues run five services a day - and the day is spent in continuous prayer.The sound of the shofar marks the end of the holy day.The book of Exodus tells the story of the Israelites journey to the promised land.Sukkot commemorates these years spent wandering the desert, living in makesht dwellings.Some Jewish families observe the festivals by living in temporary huts called sukkot they have built themselves out of branches and leaves.Each day they hold celebrations with four types of plant: branches of palm, myrtle and willow and a citrus fruit called an etrog.Sukkot is intended to be a joyful festival that lets Jews live close to nature and know that God is taking care of them.Shemini Atzeret is an extra day after the end of Sukkot. Jews spend some time in their sukkot, but not as much, and without some of the rituals.Simchat Torah means Rejoicing in the Torah.Synagogues read from the Torah - the law of God as revealed to Moses - every week, completing one read-through each year.They reach the end on Simchat Torah and this holiday marks the completion of the cycle, to begin again the next week with Genesis.Hanukkah or Chanukah is sometimes known as the Festival of Lights, and celebrates the miracle of the oil.The celebration refers to  BC, when a group of Jews called the Maccabees recaptured Jerusalem from the occupying Syrian Greeks.When they came to rededicate the temple, they had only enough sacred oil to light the menorah - a seven-branched candlestick - for one day.Despite this, the candles remained lit for eight days.Jews celebrate this by lighting one extra candle on a special nine-branched menorah, called a chanukkiya, each night of the eight-day festival.They say prayers and eat fried foods to remind them of the oil.Some gts are exchanged, including chocolate money and special spinning tops called dreidels.Known as the Jewish Mardi-Gras, Purim is celebrated all over the world with an all-day party.The holiday celebrates the saving of the Jews from ancient royal adviser Haman, who planned to massacre the Jewish people in the Achaemenid Empire in the Middle East.His plans were foiled by Mordecai and his cousin and adopted daughter Esther, who had risen to become Queen of Persia.According to the book of Esther in the Jewish bible the Torah, the day of deliverance should be celebrated as a day of feasting.Purim is normally celebrated with an exchange of gts between friends and families, and by giving donations to the poor.People gather for a huge feast known as a Seudat Purim and there are public readings of the Scroll of Esther.The festival celebrates God liberating Jewish people from slavery in ancient Egypt and their freedom as a nation under Moses.In the Book of Exodus, the Bible tells that God helped the Children of Israel to escape from slavery by inflicting ten plagues upon the ancient Egyptians before the Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves.The tenth and worst of the plagues was the death of the Egyptian first-born.The Israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb.This was so that the spirit of the Lord knew to pass over the first-born in these homes, hence the English name of the holiday.It is said the Israelites left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise, or leaven.Flat unleavened breadis therefore traditionally eaten during the holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MP Frank Field said the man was denied the crucial aposmobility elementapos of Personal Independence Paymentin the last few months despite having bones coming through the flesh. The Independent MP unfurled photos of the anonymous manaposs gnarled hands and feet in a bid to shock Tory ministers into action. He did not reveal the identity of the -year-old former church minister from Birkenhead, Wirral, or share photos of his face. But speaking to the Mirror after the exchange, the former Labour MP said the man now faces losing his mobility car following the assessment. Mr Field said when the man came into his constituency surgery, he struggled to walk into the room where he was meeting his MP. These are feet the Tories thought were made for walking, the MP said.  Work and Pensions Committee chief Mr Field - who has left the Labour Party - said the man had an underlying condition for  years which then caused rheumatoid arthritis to affect his hands and feet. The MPaposs office said he was diagnosed with an aggressive auto-immune disease in  followed by bronchial asthma. Mr Field told us after the exchange: My constituent has suffered with a long-term degenerative condition. There is no cure. The joints on his hands and feet are locked into one position. He walks with two crutches and requires regular breaks to recover after walking short distances. He falls regularly and is unable to brace himself during his falls. He was recently awarded Personal Independence Payment after a reassessment. He was awarded full care but has lost all his mobility component. This means he will lose his mobility car.    PIP - paid to help with daily costs of being disabled - comes in two parts worth around £ a week. One part is paid for mobility and the other part for aposdaily livingapos. Mr Fieldaposs office said the man was granted the aposdaily livingapos element of PIP but not the separate aposmobilityapos element when he was transferred from older benefit DLA in the last few months. He is now mounting an internal appeal with the DWP. In the Commons, Mr Field added: Might I meet with the minister immediately to give him a file of photographs of constituents who failed to get any mobility component, even when they have feet with the bones coming through the flesh like this one  So that we can have an urgent meeting to show the procedure we all wish to see applying doesnapost actually operate currently. Mr Field obtained permission from the man to publish these photos.  It comes after as almost three-quarters of people who take their PIP claims to an appeal tribunal win their case. DWP minister Justin Tomlinson said: I would be very happy to meet [Mr Field], who I know has a huge amount of expertise in this area. But we do know that those who transfer from [old benefit] DLA to PIP - there are now , claimants who werenapost on enhanced mobility under DLA who now are under PIP. A DWP spokeswoman said the department was urgently investigating Mr Fieldaposs claims. The case was one of a string of distressing benefit cases raised today during Work and Pensions Questions - most of them about Universal Credit . Labour MP Rachel Maskell said: A young constituent couldnapost afford to go to his Universal Credit appointment, was sanction, then lost his home in Yorkaposs resettlement project and ended up on the streets.  When we were told the government would fix the problems with Universal Credit as it was being rolled out, why hasnapost the government stuck to this commitment  Meanwhile, Tory ministers were blasted over the level of back payments to around , severely disabled people who moved to Universal Credit. Emergency rules were approved in July for people who used to receive Severe Disability Premiums. But campaigners say they are not enough, as the maximum £-a-month rates only go to a small fraction of claimants. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: Will the government explain why those payments still do not fully reflect the financial loss those disabled people have suffered  "},{"url":null,"title":"former conservative mp heidi allen","story":"NewsFormer Conservative MP Heidi Allen joins the Liberal DemocratsThe committed Remainers move takes the Lib Dem tally in the Commons to  and has been warmly welcomed by leader Jo SwinsonShareCommentsByGavin Cordon:,  OCT NewsHeidi Allen has joined the Lib Dems \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

It warns that even a benign no-deal Brexit would likely lead to the Treasury borrowing an estimated £ billion, sending debt as a percentage of national income to almost % for the first time since the mid-s.It warns that public spending, which Chancellor Sajid Javid increased this year after almost a decade of austerity, could need to be cut again as the government struggled to deal with the consequences of a smaller economy and higher debt for funding public services in the wake of Britain crashing out fo the EU without a deal. The groupaposs green budget also warned Tory ministers to shelve plans for permanent tax cuts, as it could reduce the cash available to the government to weather any no-deal Brexit storm.An analysis of Britainaposs economic performance by investment bank Citi, as part of the report, said growth in the UK has been weaker than in other G economies since the Brexit referendum un  and national income is already between .% and %lower than it would have been without the EU referendum result.    Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said the governmentaposs commitments would put spending far closer to Labouraposs pledge in their  manesto than anything from the Conservativeaposs last set of election pledges. He added: The government is now adrt without any effective fiscal anchor. Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming Budget. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy. It will be crucial that these programmes are temporary: an economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more. Christian Schulz, Chief UK Economist at Citi, said:The UK economy is already around £ billion smaller than it would have been without a vote to leave the European Union, with the UK missing out on a bout of global growth. Business investment is up to % lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth. Brexit no longer “just” determines future relations with the UK’s biggest trading partner and the transition towards them it is also intertwined with the political outlook and thus broader economic policies.

She was supposed to marry -year-old supermarket worker Stewart Peters there in July next year. I was utterly devastated. I broke down in tears when I saw the letter. I wasnapost expecting it at all, there was no prior warning, no phonecall, nothing, the receptionist, of Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire, said.    Itaposs soul destroying and a cold-hearted decision by the owners to close it. It has been awfully handled. We had everything sorted for the wedding but now weaposve got to look around again to find a place we want to get married. After reading the letter I called the hotel to find out more but they told me nothing. There was no sympathy for our situation and no help at all. We were told the owner no longer wants to do weddings, thataposs all we were told. Culcreuchaposs general manager Robert Reynolds wrote in the letter: It is therefore with great sadness that we have to inform you that we will be unable to hold your wedding here.    We realise that this [the closure] will come as a traumatic shock to you and your family as it is to all members of our staff. Deposits will be refunded but Mhairi-Claire remains crushed. She added: I remember when I first saw the castle. I wanted to get married there, itaposs perfect - so for it to be cancelled has just ruined it. Culcreuch was ideal for us as it was dog friendly. Having my two wee boy dogs at the wedding was a big thing for me, soI canapost have them there then it will be devastating. We booked the venue about a year ago so we now have to look for another one. I have everything booked so I am now worried about suppliers becausewe canapost get the same date then they might be booked up already. We have people coming from all over so we want something close. I have started to look again. Other brides took to social media to express their disappointment at having their wedding cancelled.

At first girlfriends, then boyfriends came and went, and his audiences, though adoring, always disappeared home at the end of the night, leaving the singer from Pinner alone with a cavernous emotional void inside. None of them brought the genuine love he craved. So instead, he became a self-confessed shopping addict, hooked on buying possessions by the truckload. This was a man who would take a ­shopping trolley around Cartier. Yet despite his bottomless wallet, he was never able to buy enough to fill the emptiness inside, no matter how many bouquets he ordered to fill his homes. Of course, none of his other ­addictions had managed to satisfy him either. I described yesterday how he told me candidly about his demons – alcohol, cocaine and toxic comfort eating when we met. Thankfully, a stint in rehab helped him conquer them.So what was this elusive love Elton was searching for Feeling let down by his own, I believe for many decades he was looking for the love of surrogate parents. And that, of course, is the greatest irony of all. For ultimately, it turns out it has not been finding stand-in parents, people to pamper, indulge, to infantilise him, which has made Elton truly happy for the first time in his le. It has instead been finding a husband in partner of more than  years and “soul mate”, film producer David Furnish, who is an equal, not a carer or manager.And most surprising of all, it has been becoming a parent himself, to his two young sons Zachary, eight and ­six-year-old Elijah.And I imagine this comes as no bigger surprise to anyone than  year-old Elton, who never saw himself as a dad.    “I always said no to having kids,” he once conceded. “Because I’m too old, too set in my ways, too selfish, and the lestyle doesn’t suit me.” All that began to sht the day he met David in October . “I wanted to meet new people so I rang up a friend in London and said, ‘Could you please rattle some new people together for dinner here Saturday ’” Among those new faces was Canadian advertising executive Furnish, who’d not been particularly keen on coming along. He soon changed his tune - the mutual attraction between the pair was immediate. Elton said: “He had a real job, his own apartment, a car. He was independent. I didn’t need to take care of him.” The next day Elton called David, who is  years his junior, to invite him round for a Chinese takeaway. Right from the start theirs was an equal relationship there was nothing parental or manager superstar about it. That David has refused to be a parent figure to him, has actually been the key to their success. David wasn’t frightened to tell him what was what. We see that very clearly in Tantrums and Tiaras, the candid documentary they made together about Elton in . Elton once said: “I knew he was the one because he is not afraid of me. He always tells me exactly what he thinks.” Yet David and Elton still clearly have a deeply affectionate, romantic relationship. The pair still write each other a letter every Saturday, the weekday they met, no matter where in the world they are. They entered into a civil partnership in , and in  after the law change, got married. “For David and I, being able to openly love and commit to one another, and for that to be recognized and celebrated, is what makes le truly worth living,” Elton wrote afterwards. The stability of their relationship enabled Elton to think the previously unthinkable: becoming a dad. In  he and David attempted unsuccessfully to adopt a little boy called Lev and his brother, who he’d met on a visit to a Ukrainian orphanage. That was a tipping point. Elton said: “This boy was trying to tell me something. He was trying to say, through God or someone , you can be a dad, look at how much pleasure I gave you in an hour and a half.” It finally seemed a natural progression to have their own sons, via the same surrogate they say they “love as a sister” in Calornia, followed shortly. Elton has now made the decision to retire from touring, to be home with his lads in Windsor, to do the school run, making sure they do chores, tidy their rooms, teaching them values of kindness, and watching them play football. Elton the doing father is not the Elton I met. For the first time his le is about other people, not him, and he admits he has never felt so content within an environment which previously would have felt mundane. He explained recently: “It’s fantastic being a dad. But ten years agoyou’d have told me that, I’d have said you’re crazy. I have learned that a parent’s capacity for love is endless.” So in giving so much love, it seems to have finally sated his own need to be loved - something which always struck me as a psychosis, firmly rooted in what he believes was in large part an unhappy childhood.    As I’ve already mentioned, Elton has repeatedly talked about how he feels let down by his parents. The pictures he paints of his mother and father, Sheila and Stanley Dwight are always fraught with emotion. Stanley, he maintains, was cold. He said: “He was a tough and unemotional man. Hard. In the RAF. He was dismissive, disappointed and finally absent. I just wanted him to acknowledge what I’d done. But he never did.” Others have disagreed, and certainly I have been told Stanley would take his son to football matches, and even bought the child prodigy his first piano. But whether completely true, partly true, or not true at all, Elton has held on to the negative. He was much closer to his mother Sheila, but again the relationship seems to have carried its own share of resentment. He now says: “she always seemed to be looking for a reason not to be happy, always seemed to be in search of a fight”. The pair were estranged for years. She infamously invited an Elton lookalike to her th birthday. Sheila maintained she never actually got to meet her grandchildren. Elton on the other hand now says it was her choice not to meet Zachary and Elijah. Elton once explained: “I don’t hate her, but I don’t want her in my le.” She in turn told him: “I love you but I don’t like you at all.” They only reconciled around a year before Sheila’s death in . But a friend of hers who remained in contact until the end confided to me relations were never as good before her death as Elton has painted publicly. One comment Sheila made to the same friend was that ‘Himself’, as she unflatteringly called Elton, only stopped shouting at people when he was performing... With all this personal baggage, perhaps it makes sense that the best remedy for an unhappy childhood, is to give a happy one to others. Just as he’s doing with his two boys. Responsibility for two little people has transformed him from the man-child he’s been most of his le. Until Elton became a father, he could never truly grow up himself. He was stuck. Superstars don’t grow up – they are allowed to have tantrums, they have everything done for them. Even David allowed Elton his outbursts. But his kids won’t. His decision to be there for his boys by retiring from touring says it all.

Dai Crofts, , was tragically found dead in January days after he had pleaded to be hospitalised following psychotic episodes. Mr Crofts had long struggled with his mental health and had been diagnosed with depression in  and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act five years later, Pontypridd Coroneraposs Court heard. He attended hospital on both January  and  this year and asked to be admitted, but was given oral medication and sent home. The following day, January , Mr Crofts took his own le.  Despite family concerns, coroner Graeme Hughes found that trawlerman Mr Crofts, of Wick, South Wales, received appropriate care from the Cardf and Vale University Health Board and recorded a narrative conclusion, reports Wales Online.    His family said said they wanted to see better support for men with mental health issues and for better mental health care across Wales. Mr Crofts mental health issues started in his late teens with depression and anxiety, and gradually deteriorated to include paranoid and delusional thoughts. The symptoms intensied following the birth of his son Harrison in April , and the following month he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He spent time under observation at Llandough Hospital before being released. The inquest heard that Mr Crofts, who was born in Wrexham, started a relationship with Jessica Beard in  and the pair got engaged in June . In a statement read to the court, Ms Beard, who was pregnant with their second child at the time of her fianceaposs death, said: He desperately wanted to be sectioned due to voices telling him to kill himself. His family said that shortly after discovering Ms Beard was expecting their second child he asked to be sectioned again. On January ,  the couple went to Barry Hospital, where Mr Crofts was seen by an occupational therapist. Mr Crofts asked to be prescribed medication but as no doctor was available to see him, that was not possible.    An appointment was scheduled for January , where Mr Crofts spent around an hour with qualied GP and psychiatrist Dr Alison McLain. During the appointment he was prescribed three medications to help deal with depression, anxiety and psychotic symptoms. The next day Mr Crofts told his partner he was going for a drive “to clear his head” at around pm. Ms Beard later became concerned after he was not responding to her text messages. She tracked his location via his mobile phone to a car park in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ms Beard found his vehicle but there was no sign of her fiance. She later called South Wales Police and officers found Mr Croft’s body nearby. Mr Crofts was pronounced dead at around .am on January . A post-mortem report found no contributing levels of drugs or alcohol in Mr Crofts system, and his medical cause of death was recorded as hanging. The inquest heard evidence from occupational therapist Sarah Ames who saw Mr Crofts on January . Ms Ames said: “He was a bit confused. He was insightful to know he was unwell. He wanted to start some anti-psychotic medication.”    Following his request, Ms Ames spoke with Dr McLain who said as she was unable to see Mr Crofts in person and could not prescribe medication. The appointment was however made. When asked how Mr Crofts reacted to the decision, Ms Ames said: “I think he was pleased. I would imagine he would have liked to have had something sooner - but he was accepting of that plan. Ms Ames added that Mr Crofts did not appear to be “upset or distressed”, and did not warrant the involvement of the Crisis Team which deal with patients deemed to be at a greater risk. During his appointment with Dr McLain on January , the inquest heard he described himself as “worried and possessed”. Dr McLain told the inquest: I do not recall anything remarkable about his presentation. He was quite able and ready to tell his story, and he was well supported by his partner.” She added: I absolutely thought he did not want to harm himself and I still believe that. He said he wanted to get better, he had a lot to live for. He recognised he was ill. He knew he needed treatment.” When askedhe appeared to be a danger to himself, Dr McLain replied no. Dr McLain said she did not directly recall Mr Crofts asking to be admitted to hospital.

Emma Moffatt and partner Jordan Burns reserved a new-build home in Huyton, near Liverpool, but asked for several things to be changed before they took the keys. The couple said there had been several issues with builders, Bellway, including that the new plot had a coal shaft close to the property, a misspelled name and claims they were overcharged for flooring. They wrote to chief executive Jason Honeyman asking for a gesture of goodwill infor the errors, the Liverpool Echo reports.  But Ms Moffatt, from Lydiate, near Liverpool, said she was shocked days later when she read the response from the regionaposs managing director, telling her nothing in her complaint warranted a goodwill gesture. The email added that because of the complaintaposs nature and how unhappy she seemed to be Bellway was not the builder for her. The company cancelled the coupleaposs reservation - meaning the house at the Willow Grange development was back on the market.  Ms Moffatt said the couple are now extremely upset and angry, telling the ECHO she had a panic attack when she heard the news. Describing the situation as the worst customer experience, Emma said: I was driving and Jordan rang me to inform me of the news. I had a panic attack on the side of the motorway and my parents had to come and get me, I literally cried the whole night as my dream house had just crumbled in front of my eyes. Ms Moffatt said despite the setback, she rang Bellway in an attempt to salvage the deal and spoke to several officials but said she was spoken to rudely.  I hope nobody  has to go through the stress an upset we have been through, she added. In a statement, Bellway - one of the UKaposs largest house builders - said it would be inappropriate and unprofessional to comment - and that it was incredibly proud of our customer service. Ms Moffatt said the couple were devastated, adding: Mine and my partneraposs dream house, which we have worked so hard for, is gone. We are extremely upset but angry more than anything with how we have been treated. It seems that they thought we are a young couple so let’s bully them out of the house - and this is not ok. Ms Moffatt said the couple had been searching for a property for a year and had visited the Willow Grange development on ious occasions looking for the perfect home. She added: We were looking for a home to start a family in, so after a few months of back and forth, we finally decided on a four-bedroom detached house, so reserved the house. Ms Moffatt said after being shown the plans, they were told there was a mine shaft close to the house - prompting the couple to ask about the risks involved - but said the issue was brushed under the carpet and we still have not received the information.

Itaposs allegedly left roads broken and muddied in Waterside Village in St Helens, Merseyside.But Liverpool Echo shows advertising brochures depict pristine roads fully tarmaced.One angry resident, David Lyons, said people are expected to pay Morris Homes between £ and £ a year as a service charge which goes towards the “upkeep” of the development. The -year-old father said: “They finished building on the site earlier this year and numerous times we have been told that they will be completing the roads but they haven’t done it yet.”  Mr Lyons explained that Morris Homes began building Waterside Village in  before his we bought a home there in . After they married and had two children together, the couple moved to another home on the development. He said: “We were told that the roads would be completed when all the houses were built, but they kept adding to them. “Because of the work vehicles, the roads are full of pot holes and the kerbs are extremely high. “People around here have suffered damage to their cars and one neighbour even fell down a manhole that wasn’t properly covered.  “We are paying hundreds of pounds for them to ‘cut the grass’ and look after the estate but they refuse to do the one thing we have asked for.” But hospital worker David said his neighbours became infuriated when Morris Homes purchased land next to their estate to develop a second phase of Waterside Village. He said: “Our estate was clearly so popular that they decided to build another just like it.  “So far they have built about  homes so we knew they weren’t going to be bothered about sorting out roads. “The most ridiculous thing they have done though, was use a picture of our estate for their new brochure. “It shows a row of houses from one of the streets, but they have photoshopped tidy, clean, tarmac roads onto the picture. “That just proves that they are aware of the issue and have decided to cover it up with some clever computer work rather than just fixing the problem.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how stay cold free winter","story":"NewsSurprising ways to stay healthy and cold-free this winterWhen the snfles strike, you just have to sit it out with plenty of fluids and painkillers - so here are some tactics to keep the infections at bayShareCommentsByKim Jones:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsUnfortunately, theres simply no quick fix for the common cold \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

And when the snfles strike, you just have to sit it out with plenty of fluids and painkillers - so here are some tactics to keep the rhinovirus infections at bay. Sing while you soap You can catch a cold by inhaling infected ­droplets coughed, sneezed or breathed out by a carrier. But you can also pick up a rhinovirus infection on your hands from ­doorknobs or handrails and trolleys. Some of these viruses can survive on your hands for up to an hour, so try to wash your hands regularly. And do a thorough job. Don’t just run your hands under water. The World Health Organisation recommends  seconds using soap – roughly the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. So go for itas you clean palms, backs of hands, in between fingers and thumbs and under the nails. Dry with a paper towel, then use it to turn off the tap.    Don’t touch your face Can’t get to a basin to wash your hands  Then avoid touching your face until you can. Cold viruses enter your body through your mouth, eyes or nose. If you’re prone to nail-biting, use a special bitter-tasting polish to help discourage you from the habit. Wash it hot As well as surviving on hard surfaces, cold and flu viruses linger on fabrics, too. If someone in your house has the snfles, microbiologists suggest skipping the eco-friendly option on your washing machine when doing their clothes, bedding and towels, as the wash temperature won’t be high enough. Instead, go for  degrees. Use a hot cycle in your dryeryou can, to kill off microbes.    Take echinacea The herb has been shown to prevent cold symptoms erupting, says immunologist Dr Ross Walton. In ,  participants took part in the longest and largest trial by the Common Cold Centre in Cardf on the preventative use of echinacea over a four-month period. Dr Walton says: “The development of recurrent colds reduced by %, as well as symptom severity.”He adds that herbal ­medicines that contain all parts of the plant – such as A.Vogel Echinaforce avogel , work best.Go incognitoCover your face and nose with a scarf in cold weather .A Yale University study found the virus flourishes better in the naturally cooler environment of your nasal passages than at a warmer core body ­temperature because the immune response doesn’t work as well in the cold. So keeping nasal passages warm could mean the virus won’t replicate as easily.    Gargle with sea salt water People with the first symptoms of a cold who washed out mucus from the nose and gargled with cooled, boiled salt water reduced their cold virus ­symptoms by two days, Edinburgh researchers found. They were less likely to need medicines. It’s thought sea salt may boost the body’s ­antiviral defences. Keep your feet warm too Research has foundour feet become chilly, blood vessels in our noses constrict. Less blood flow to the nose means fewer cold-fighting white cells will reach it, so any dormant infection is more likely to take hold. Wear socks with at least % wool to keep toes toasty.    Exercise A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found people who exercised regularly cut cold risks by half. Try to achieve at least  minutes of moderate aerobic activityevery week. Be an office clean freak Almost half of desks, computer mice and office phones harbour the cold virus, according to research. Desk sharing can expose you to five times more germs thanyou have your own. Pack eco-friendly tissues in your work bag to wipe down your workstation. Stop stressing An experiment that saw people given the cold virus nasally revealed the most stressed were more likely to succumb than those who were relaxed. Researchers concluded that under stress immune system cells produce levels of inflammation that lead to disease. If you are stressed, try yoga or meditation.

Ben Lacomba contacted Kent Police more than  hours after mum-of-five Sarah Wellgreen had disappeared from the home they shared in New Ash Green, Kent, in October last year. In two emergency calls on October  and lasting  minutes, the -year-old spoke calmly as he described how he had woken at the four-bedroom property the previous morning and realised the -year-old beautician was missing. Her phones and purse were still at the house and her Hyundai car was parked outside. A jury at Woolwich Crown Court, London, listened to the initial  call and then subsequent aposhigh priorityapos call in which Lacomba detailed Sarahaposs aposcomplicated and messyapos lestyle.  He said she had up to seven phones, and claimed she had been stalked and assaulted at work. He also told the operator that her on off partner at the time Neil James was aposparanoidapos and on one occasion had put a tracker on Sarahaposs phone. The court also heard of the fruitless attempts made by Mr James and several members of Sarahaposs family, including her mother Ann Reid and her -year-old son Lewis Burdett, to contact her throughout October . Her phone was going to voicemail and there was no activity on WhatsApp or her Facebook account, the court heard. At one stage Mr James sent a message to his girlfriend asking aposAre you alive apos He and Lewis also contacted Lacomba in their desperate bid to track Sarah down and said they would be contacting police to search for her. At the start of his call on the morning of October  Lacomba, who denies murder, told the operator: She hasnapost gone missing before but her, erm, sheaposs got a bit of a weird le letaposs put it that way.  He described how they shared the house for the sake of their children but that Sarah was apossort of like seeing a few blokesapos other than Mr James, adding aposand so it looks like sheaposs cheating on himapos. Lacomba described how Sarah split her time between living in the family home, at Mr Jamesaposs home in Farnham, Surrey, and in Portsmouth where she worked for Puresun beauty salon. He said she had told him that Mr James, who himself had children from previous relationships, aposput a tracker on her phoneapos. Heaposs really paranoid about her, like where she, like he doesnapost trust her and that...heaposs always like well just like accusing her of stuff like, added Lacomba. She said both his relationships with the kidsapos mums is poor, erm, like they both cheated on him. Lacomba also claimed one of Mr Jamesaposs former partners was also stalking Sarah, sending her photos of her car when she was staying at his house. In a series of questions from the operator, he said Sarah had not left any sign that she was likely to harm herself or any mental health problems. When asked whether he had any idea of her whereabouts, he replied No I donapost, before adding after a pause of several seconds Thataposs why Iaposm phoning you. The operator also asked: Is there a reason that she may have gone missing  Anything going on that might be upsetting or any reason that you know of that she might go missing at all  Lacomba replied: Like I said like, I, I, nothing, well obviously I, I, I find out about like her sort of seeing quite a few blokes sort of thing, erm...

Jason spent four days in hospital and his mum now wants to raise awareness to stop this craze.    A reckless and dangerous viral crazeHospital bosses have warned that more and more teenagers are seriously injuring themselves by taking part in online challenges that encourage them to set themselves on fire. The craze is popular among young people hoping to become social media stars, but unsurprisingly has led to an increase in cases of serious burns. Specialist staff at Morriston Hospital, in Swansea, have acknowledged it is becoming a big problem. Many patients have been left with lelong scars, a plastic surgeon confirmed.  More cases are being seen by medical experts because of the craze, which originally began in  and has been picked up again. While the hospital did not wish to provide details of the dferent challenges, a quick search online reveals the scale of the problem. One challenge, known online as the Fire Challenge, is literally as crazy as it sounds. Youngsters are challenged to pour liquid on themselves and set themselves on fire. This has resulted in people requiring surgery and le-support treatment. previously reported that in August, a -year-old girl from Detroit burned  per cent of her body in the dangerous trend.Timiyah Landers was with two friends at her home in Michigan, and her mother Brandi had just made them pancakes. However minutes after she left the girls alone, there was a aposloud bangapos and Timiyah was engulfed in flames. Her stepfather immediately put her in a bath and splashed water on her body as her mother tore off her burning clothes. Timiyah was taken to hospital and put on a ventilator in intensive care, with her body bandaged from head to her knees.  Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is issuing a warning and some advice to anyone who has taken part in any of these challenges online. “I can understand there is pressure on young people to gain acceptance or boost their online profiles by doing such risky things as these challenges,” said Jeremy Yarrow, a plastic surgeon at Morriston Hospital. “But from the patients I see, the results can be very dferent, with some requiring le support treatment and many left with lelong scars.” Mr Yarrow added that while most teenagers presenting with burns are treated as outpatients, some are hospitalised for a considerableof time. “In some severe and sometimes le-threatening cases, they are admitted to hospital for long periods of time for complex surgery resulting in long term mental and physical issues,” he said. While the health board would not release specic details of the challenges doing the rounds online, they did confirm that there are “ious” ones being attempted by teenagers.  Ana Biney, a staff nurse at Morriston Hospitalaposs Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery, said: “They copy them from social media and YouTube and call them YouTube Challenges. “They film each other doing the challenges and then upload them in the hope they will become social media stars. “We have definitely seen an increase in the number of teenagers who have suffered quite serious burns because of this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bridesmaids trolled being given bin","story":"NewsBridesmaids trolled for being given bin bag dresses and trainers for big dayOne bride made sure there was no confusion between her dress and her bridesmaids outfitsShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  OCT NewsThe dresses received very mixed reviews\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Luckily on this occasion the home side were able to clear.What the game needed was something special, something to get the fans on their feet and eventually McDaid would deliver exactly that.A -yard strike would fly past Derek Gaston, crash off the post and find the back of the net in what proved to be the perfect settler for both players and fans.It was at this point Dundee played some of their best stuff and Dorrans was involved when the Dee almost grabbed their second on the stroke of half time. He took a smart free-kick, finding McGhee in the middle of the box before he laid off to McDaid, his strike crashing off Ricky Little when it looked certain to go in.That’s the thing about this team, the philosophy manager McPake wants to use can cause impatience in the stands but when they get going, it can be easy on the eye.Especially with strong midfield players like Dorrans, Shaun Byrne and Paul McGowan pulling the strings.It was another well-worked set-piece which brought a second for Dundee and for McDaid.He found Sean Mackie on the byline who ed it to his fellow-winger before McDaid cut inside and rled a spectacular strike into the top corner to double his tally and better his previous long-range strike in the first half.Despite an attempted comeback from the visitors following the second goal, it was always comfortable for Dundee after they doubled their tally – and they could have had even morenot for some poor decision making.The real test lies ahead, though, as they look to follow this result up with another victory.Each league win so far has been followed up by two poor results – an average that simply cannot continueDundee are to have any hope this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9b168c2b2db3.50880008.jpg ","title":"ewan gurr decisions on future must put people before profit","story":"Exactly  years ago, I visited India for the first time.I was there on best man duty for a friend but, while there, I decided to take the opportunity to travel and see some of the country.I arranged to spend a few days volunteering for the organisation led by Mother Teresa, pictured, in Kolkata, formerly Calcutta.She died in  but her legacy was clearly alive and volunteering in the House for the Destitute and Dying was a moving experience, as I cared for terminally ill men who died even in my short time there.At the end of day one, I walked around Kolkata and observed a lorry carrying along a kind of old rusty freight with “Dundee” emblazoned on the side in faded white letters.I spoke to some of the locals and discovered that it had been exported from the dying embers of our city’s jute industry in the s.At its peak the jute industry in Dundee employed % of the city’s population – about , people – and brought industrial resilience to the city as well as financial stability to many families.When I ed from India, I wanted something made from jute and ordered a rug for my we via a fairtrade catalogue, which highlighted the origin in Kolkata.It was then, for the first time, I realised that the jute barons’ decision to export the industry from Dundee, motivated by a stated desire to cut costs, had enslaved a whole race of foreign people to poor pay.Fairtrade organisations intervene on unethical working practices in places such as Kolkata to ensure workers are fairly remunerated.Our history highlights how powerful people deindustrialised our city and deprived our people because they saw greater value in exporting and extorting and perceived profit-making as more attractive than poverty-proofing.In doing so, they not only enslaved a race of foreigners but sold off , of our own citizens to competing for jobs that did not exist.It is not hard to understand decades of record unemployment as prosperity vacated the city and poverty moved in like an unwelcome lodger.In his book Disposable People, Kevin Bales, a professor in contemporary slavery, estimates that  million people still experience modern day slavery, who will now include those in Kolkata.Slavery is simply the application of property law to people, and financially-motivated decisions were made in Dundee that sold off the prospect of prosperity for our citizens in a manner closely related to slavery.They did not sell the iniduals personally, but they sold any hope of securing a sustainable future.Dundee has, for too long, been enslaved by some deeply dubious decisions made behind closed doors.I only hope and pray the decisions made going forward prioritise our people rather than profit."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7a5f7c5fd369.71507880-e1568301442579-940x564.jpg ","title":"mcpake pleased dundee lived up to pressure and turned on style against arbroath","story":"Dundee boss James McPake was delighted to see fan frustration turn to elation as his team eased to a - victory over Arbroath.A shaky opening  minutes led to murmurs of discontent in the home support but the Dark Blues turned on the style to secure a victory over the Red Lichties in what proved to be one of their most complete displays this season.Declan McDaid’s double ensured McPake’s men finished the weekend in the play-off position and closed the gap on rivals Dundee United at the top of the table to six points.The Dundee gaffer said: “The players will manage to get over frustration from the stands because that’s how we’re going to play.“The same football which has maybe caused frustration was getting applause with  minutes to go.“I understand why the fans are frustrated, I really do, I’ve played here and the frustration is because they’re desperate for us to do well.“They aren’t just coming here to have a go and shout at players, I completely get that. It’s great that the fans get the chance with  minutes to go without pressure on them.“Let’s not be kidded, there’s pressure on the fans because they want to win games, too, so I’m delighted for them.“We’re creating more chances and getting up the pitch – but this is only three points.”McDaid bagged two crackers to ensure all three points were staying in Dundee and McPake was happy for his winger – who he insists has shown his worth to the team since his arrival from Ayr United in the summer.He added: “I’m delighted for Declan McDaid getting the goals. The work he does defensively probably goes unnoticed.“If you ask the boys in our team about what he does going back the pitch, that’s why they trust him so much and why I trust him so much.“We have challenged him to be better up the pitch like everyone  and on Saturday he was.“I think he needed that wee boost because of his play over the course of the season, particularly going back the game in games when we’ve needed him.“In the Alloa game, Jack Hamilton made the penalty save in that game butMcDaid hadn’t ran  yards to clear the ball at the back post we draw that game and there’s further frustration at the football club.“That’s what he does going that way and we have seen what he can do going the other way on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"st johnstone keeper enjoyed a chinese meal before each match","story":"St Johnstone fan Murray Blair, from Newport, sent in a tale about a former St Johnstone goalkeeper.“Jim Donaldson was a goalkeeper with St Johnstone in the late s,” said Murray.“Reading through some old football articles, I came across an amusing story which might tickle BwB readers.

With keeper Chris Maxwell stranded at his neer post all it needed was a tap in for a goal.However no Aberdeen player was in a situation to capitalize in front of goal.In the th minute Lewis Ferguson fired in a powerful  yard drive but it was straight at keeper Maxwell who comfortably saved,Moments later Hedges shot over from the edge of the penalty area as Aberdeen began to press.Hibs went ahead in the th minute when a corner kick fell to defender Ryan PORTEOUS who took a touch then fired beyond keeper Lewis from  yards out.Aberdeen were deservedly leading. A bad day for the Dons got even worse when Main received a straight red card for a challenge on Stevie Mallan where he jumped into the challenge and appeared to catch his foot with his studs.Red was harsh on Main.Yet again captain Lewis came to the rescue when Doidge was one on one but the keeper raced off his line and brilliantly blocked his  yard shot.McGinn#s cross from the left finds Hedges who lays the ball back to Gallagher. He finds himself some space in the box but he shoots over the bar.In the th minute Hedges slid the eball to substitute Jon Gallagher who turned quickly in the box to open up space but blasted over from  yards.Hibs should have doubled their advantage in the th minute when Doidge, who had looked offsside when collecting the ball, was played one on one with Lewis.Instead of squaring to the onrushing Scott Allan for what would surely have been a goal he opted to shoot and Lewis raced off his line to make another vital save.Moments later Hedges fired in a vicious  yard drive that cracked off the near post.A man down Aberdeen equalized in the th minute when COSGROVE raced onto a corner from Niall McGinn to bullet in a header from  yards.Deep into injury time Aberdeen were reduced to  men when Ferguson was red carded for a challenge on Mallan.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Leigh, Considine, McKenna, Ferguson, Campbell, E.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10508500.jpg?type=article-full","title":"euro-2020-trophy-tour-details-revealed-nationwide-tour","story":"Hampden will host a series of competitive fixtures on the , ,  and  June .

Glasgow, like many other cities, is increasingly aware of the need to promote bioersity. And that means it needs space for pollinators, small mammals and birds, invertebrates and a wide range of plant species.On top of the designated meadows, seeds will be sown on a range of plots that includes parks, road verges and steep slopes that are dficult to maintain.The city in a statement said: ldquoIt is anticipated that the extent of meadow land in the city will grow by one hectare per year, which will mean a further five large-scale meadows to be created over the next four years and eight other sites to be enhanced with additional wildflower planting.The move will mark signicant changes in how open space is managed.Councillor Anna Richardson said: ldquoEven though we live in a highly urban environment, our most recent audit of the cityrsquos bioersity identied , dferent species alive in Glasgow. We have a clear responsibility to nurture bioersity in Glasgow and we can help to do that by creating spaces where a wide range of species can thrive and flourish.ldquoWildflower meadows act as habitats for pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, which are a crucial component in the sustainability of our wider environment. These meadows are also an increasingly attractive addition to our parks and can add colour to otherwise unwelcoming spaces such as central reservations along roads.ldquoBut leaving land to grow more naturally has an additional benefit that allows us to redirect resources to our wider parks operation and help ensure our parks remain one of most loved features of the city.The initiative to extend the coverage of wildflower meadows is part of the cityrsquos Local Bioersity Action Plan, which includes a specic plan to support pollinator species within Glasgow. Taken together, the plans are delivering or working on over  actions to enhance bioersity, assist and develop ecosystems and encourage volunteering across the city.The contribution of voluntary groups such as The Conservation Volunteers and the RSPB has been crucial to the effort to create wildflower meadows.Volunteers have been active in areas such as Robroyston Park, Linn Park, the Cart and Kittoch Site of Special Scientic Interest, Cleddans Burn and Cardowan Moss.Springburn Park is one area that has been earmarked for the development of a new wildflower meadow.The work involves stripping back scrub or cutting grass and removing all the vegetation so that ground suitable for wildflower planting is created.The plan will also see the nursery at Pollok Country Park be used as sowing and growing areas for wildflowers with a focus on nurturing wildflowers that are native to Scotland.Local authorities across the UK are gradually changing how they manage open spaces, such as the verges of roads.Many councils, including Edinburgh, are cutting back on traditional mowing, allowing grass to seed and flowers and other plants to grow.Britainrsquos big roads management regulators, like Highways England and Transport Scotland, last week were given new guidelines under which main road verges will only be cut twice a year, down from the previous four.Glasgow is in a race to be Britainrsquos first city to get to zero net carbon. That includes dramatic plans to re-green what was once the dear, green place.Last month the Herald revealed the city was so keen to plant more trees that it is considering proposals to re-forest its golf courses.Now an influential group of councillors has called for the courses - including the -hole Littlehill, Lethamhill and Linn Park - to be turned into forests, wetlands or even allotmentsthey shut.The councilrsquos climate emergency working group ndash in a major document still under consideration ndash said: ldquoDepending on the outcome of the current public consultation into the future of Glasgowrsquos public golf courses, it may be that some of these under-utilised sites are also repurposed for food growing, tree planting or as a carbon sink."},{"url":null,"title":"Last night s TV - Disclosure  The Seduction Game","story":"BBC, Scotland****WHAT a time to be alive.

That, and icy fury at the behaviour of so-called ldquopick-up artists who hang about the streets, preying on young women in a bid to get their phone numbers and eventually have sex with them.ldquoOnly the brave get laid, said one practitioner of the sleazy process known as ldquogaming. His nickname was Addy A-game, real name Adnan Ahmed. You may recall the Glaswegian from a video earlier this year on The Social, a podcast from BBC Scotland.Read more:YouTube pulls pick-up videos after BBC investigationThe Social commissions short videos aimed at the - audience, covering everything from panic attacks to leaving the house with a toddler in tow. Most, it is fair to say, do not rack up huge viewing figures.Then along came the film about Ahmed by Myles Bonnar, a reporter and producer who has worked with the BBC before. Two million hits and one intervention by a First Minister laterand police acted.Police Scotland had been contacted by a whistleblower several months beforehand, but it took the film going viral, and being raised at Holyrood, to get the investigation moving.The story also came to the attention of BBC Scotlandrsquos Disclosure unit, the channelrsquos equivalent to Panorama. In what was a first for BBC Scotland, the short film for The Social was developed into a half hour investigation that was broadened to include London and the pick-up business in general.Panorama became interested, and after investing some money it received a version to show in the rest of the UK. The two programmes, with some dferences, mainly to do with dfering legal systems, aired at the same time last night. ldquoTwo for one no longer applies to just supermarkets: it is the modern, multi-ing way in the media too.Read Alison Rowats TV week:Catherine the Great, World on Fire, The Apprentice, The Capture, reviewsBonnar spoke to two young women who had been approached by Ahmed in Glasgow. Chillingly, he had secretly filmed the encounters stupidly, he had uploaded them on to the web. We saw one woman being polite but clearly trying to distance herself from him. She had, she explained later, been trying to spare his feelings.Digging deeper, Bonnar discovered a ldquoseduction industry worth, he said, pound million. It was not clear how he arrived at such a precise figure, but there were training courses advertised on the web ranging from pound for a weekend up to pound for a week abroad.Bonnar enrolled on a course and went to London to learn from a couple of self-styled Lotharios. He went undercover, which consisted of shaving his beard, changing his name, and wearing a hidden camera. Not quite Serpico, but then he was hardly dealing with the sharpest pencils in the case.After rattling along for the first half, there was a drop in pace when Bonnar ed to Glasgow to show a crosssection of young people some clips from filming. They were duly horried and angry. Who knows why, other than filling time, we needed to have such reactions set out when the viewer was doubtless feeling the same way.Otherwise, the interviews, one with an academic who had researched the industry, added context and an explanation of the law in this area. But where was the chasedown, the scene without which no piece of popular reportage is complete Bonnar supplied it at the end, confronting his ldquotutors with a confidence that hinted he will go far in this investigative journalism game. ldquoItrsquos disgusting what you guys do, said one of the exposed without a trace of irony.As for Ahmed, he was convicted last month of threatening and abusive behaviour and is awaiting sentence.

But as parents are about to find out, the reality is that todayrsquos elite represent a modern version of Chester Campbell, using the stick of law and order to force us to accept their ways.The modern elite appear more caring than the old lot, often using children and ldquovictims to carry their message for them. Butanything they are more authoritarian than the like of Major Campbell.The brutality of the smacking act, passed last Thursday, will mean that a light smack on the hand or bottom of a child will be a criminal offence. Hard smacking is already illegal but to the middle class anti-smacking zealots, that was not enough. Children, they argue, need ldquoequal protection from assault.The very language they use is alien to the millions of parents who occasionally smack, rather than ldquoassault, their children. Parents know that smacking a child is a form of discipline done out of love and concern rather than something that is abusive and criminal.The zealots talk about children and adults asthey are the same, needing ldquoequal protection under the law. But ordinary people, indeed society knows that children are not the same as adults. We cannot ground adults, confiscate their phones or send them to their room. If we did we would be breaking the law.It is debatable whether smacking is the best form of discipline for children. But rather than debate or discuss this with the public, as politicians could and should,they so wish, they treat parents like dogs that need to be shown the stick. They pass a law and threaten us with the brute force of the state and the police.No longer treated like citizens, as adults who have an opinion and a basic level of autonomy to raise our children, we have a ldquoculture change imposed from on high, we are made ldquoaware by the new authoritarians holding the stick above us.The smacking act is a disgrace.

situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled outwe want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,\" she told a news conference.The protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial but have since morphed into a larger anti-government movement.Protesters say the bill is an example of

invoked a colonial-era emergency law to criminalise the wearing of masks at rallies but it fuelled more anger, with continuous daily violence over the long holiday weekend.Police officers last week fired gunshots while under attack from protesters, wounding two teenagers who were the first victims of police gunfire since the protests started.Enforcement of the mask ban began Saturday, and Ms Lam said it was too early to call it a failure.Two people have been charged with violating the mask ban so far, which is punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine upon conviction.Critics fear the emergency law, which gives Ms Lam broad powers to implement any measures she deems necessary, could pave the way for more draconian moves.Ms Lam said the government would make \"careful assessment\" before imposing other measures under the law, such as internet controls.She also pledged to continue dialogue and take steps to address livelihood and economic problems in a policy address due on October  when the Legislative Council resumes.Protesters stormed and damaged the legislative building on July , requiring repairs.Ms Lam appealed for peace when the legislative session reopens,

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While Be Reasonable Scotland is concerned this new law will turn ‘good’ parents into criminals.This is a concern I share. I have vivid memories of my mum walloping me as a mouthy teenager – but should she have been prosecuted  Absolutely not, she was a great mum, and will be mortiedshe reads this article.: Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smacking of children: Smacking laws in Scotland: current regulations, proposed changes and how the rest of the UK matches upBack in the s, hitting your kids was standard practice. Things have changed since then, as has language we use. We now talk about ‘smacking’ children, as opposed to hitting them just as we call those things we put our expensive cross-breed puppies in, crates instead of cages. It softens the blow, so to speak.Smacking our own kidsThe fact is, many of us have been driven to give our kids a smack at some point. According to a report by four leading Scottish children’s charities around % of parents in the UK have used physical punishment, with children aged three to seven the most likely to be on the receiving end.The numbers don’t surprise me. Nor do the ages of the children, as this is the time when parenting can be the most challenging. My son was three when I smacked him. Six years on, it still makes me shudder with regret.We were at the start of our holiday and had been travelling for around eight hours. I needed to change his nappy, but he wouldn’t let me. He wouldn’t stop shouting, he wouldn’t listen, he wouldn’t do a single thing I asked. So, in desperation, I smacked his very well padded bottom .And you know what  He stopped. Everything went quiet. And for a split second I felt relief. And victory. But then he turned to me and said ‘don’t you hit me’. Well, he did have a point… And then we both sobbed.A flash of furyThe essential problem with smacking or hitting your child is that it’s done in a moment of madness. It’s a flash of fury and frustration, when all other options have failed.This is what ‘time out’ was created for. It’s not just about punishing the child, it’s about giving the parent time to take a breath and calm their thoughts. There are countless times I have shut myself in the kitchen cupboard, so I can silently scream into the fridge, or bang my head against the cornflakes.I will do everything I can to avoid hitting my children because I know, in my gut, that violence is wrong. I tell me children on a daily basis not to hit each other, so how can I justy doing the same to them  We shouldn’t hit our children just because society or the law say it’s ok, or because they aren’t big enough to hit us back.In fact that is the very reason we shouldn’t hit them. Even when pushed to the limits by a tyrannical toddler, we don’t have the right to use physical violence. Just as those teachers back in the s had no right to hit our children.Many parents today look back on those times with disbelief and horror, and I wonder years from now our children will feel the same about those dark days when parents hit their children.Maybe this change in law marks the beginning of a new era of positive parenting.

It comes after a major backlash from other Northern Ireland parties, as well as the Irish Government, to proposals that would see Stormont vote every four years on whether to stay aligned with the EUs single market rules. The current set-up of the Assembly, which hasnt sat in over two years, would allow the DUP to control the decision. But Mr Barclay said: \"The key issue is the principle of consent, thats why the backstop was rejected three times, that was the concern in terms of both sides in Northern Ireland not approving of the backstop.\"So the key is the principle of consent, now of course in the mechanism, as part of the intensive negotiations we could look at that and discuss that.\"The comments open up a potential line of discussion for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who could meet later this week. Mr Varadkar is expected to hold talks with the PM amid reports that other EU leaders including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are refusing to meet him. The French President did speak with Mr Johnson by telephone last night but Downing Street suggested afterwards that they made little progress. Mr Johnson told his counterpart that the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that Brexit will be delayed beyond October . Downing Street warned Brussels it would be an \"historic misunderstanding\" to believe the so-called Benn Act could prevent a no-deal Brexit, despite being designed to do so.If a deal is not reached by October  then Mr Johnson is legally required to seek an extension. A Cabinet minister said yesterday that the Government has \"no plan\" for what might happenParliament blocks the UK leaving the EU at the end of the month.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said delivering Brexit on October  was the \"sole focus\" of ministers, who he said would do \"absolutely everything in our power\" to meet the deadline. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to meet the leaders of other Opposition parties early this week to decide on their next steps towards avoiding a no-deal Brexit. \"Its already clear that Johnsons proposal would slash food safety and standards, exposing us to, among other things, chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, currently banned under EU standards. Thats what a Trump Deal Brexit would mean in practice,\" said Mr Corbyn.\"And on environmental protections, Johnsons proposals would mean the UK ditching the highest standards on things like air pollution or chemical safety,\" he added. Meanwhile, suggestions that the UK could try to disrupt the workings of the EUthey were forced into an extension have been rejected by MEPs. Conservative MP Steve Baker even suggested that the Brexit Partys Nigel Farage could be nominated as the UKs Commissioner. \"I think we should appoint somebody with about  years experience... we should appoint somebody whos incredibly well-known throughout the institutions, somebody who can be absolutely relied upon at all times to support our exit from the European Union,\" he said.Fine Gael MEP Frances Fitzgerald said there was no chance Mr Farage would survive the necessary appointment process. Like nominees from all other  member states, he would be subject to an assessment hearing in the European Parliament. \"We havent seen anything yetwe see Farage before a parliament hearing. It would certainly be a circus, which is not what we need,\" Ms Fitzgerald said.

A retest costs £.. It means that motorists spent almost £, on tests they didnt attend.The no-shows increased from , in July.Former Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said the number of people not turning up for MoTs was \"absolutely crazy\". He called for a thorough analysis of the \"deeply worrying\" figures.\"Its fair to say that the number of people who arent bringing their vehicles for appointments is shocking,\" he said. \"It does have an impact on waiting times for MoT tests.\"I would love to see a deeper analysis of the figures because we need to know why these people arent turning up. Over , people in two months is astonishing.

Later, as an MEP, I was pleased to host the PSNI GAC in Brussels.\"A lot of hard work and effort went into setting up this fantastic club by some great people, including Ulster GAA, and it would be a shame to see it discontinued.\"The very existence of this club is of signicant political importance.

I hope this rallying cry will focus enough attention and support to ensure its survival and prosperity.\" data-dfpadtargetingPeadar Heffron joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland in A serving officer who has been a long-standing member of the PSNI GAC told the Irish News the club provided a \"safe haven and home to many gaels unable to continue playing with their own clubs for ious reasons, not least security\".\"Like any GAA club, it has given its members lelong friendships and memories,\" he said.The officer, who cannot be identied for security reasons, said at its peak the football team had  players - \"most of whom had previously played at a reasonable club level\".He said the attempted murder of Catholic officer Peadar Heffron in January , who was the then-captain of the team, and the murder of Ronan Kerr, who was from a GAA family, the next year, hit the team hard.It led them to consider closing PSNI GAC, which fields both football and hurling teams, due to fears for players lives.\"At that time, each member of the club had to decide whether they wished to continue their association, identying themselves as Irish Catholic police officers,\" he said.\"Defiantly, when the time came for the next football training a few months later we had a massive turn out, not matched before or since.\"We have played twice on the hallowed turf of Croke Park and competed against our colleagues An Garda Síochána, London politan and NYPD every two years in an international police tournament whilst also playing local club teams in counties Antrim and Down.\"Devastatingly, there has been a slow decline in the clubs fortunes in recent years.\"Since the end of   recruitment the football team has had little to no new blood. Our most recent signings have been open minded colleagues from non-GAA backgrounds willing to give the sport a go.\"They have been brilliant for us and it must be said, very talented footballers.\"With no police officers coming from a GAA background or willing to try the sport, our team has grown old. The average age of the team is now mid to late thirties with a core of players that have been together for the last decade.\"We struggle to get games at the best of times as clubs have reservations about playing us and also have their own season fixtures to contend with.\"This is the first year in memory that we have had to cancel organised games because we cannot field a team, let alone a squad.\"The officer also criticised what he described as \"aggressive and rude\" treatment by civilian staff when attending training.\"I have literally watched a number of them approach my car smiling and friendly, only to become rude and obnoxious, treating me with suspicion as they set eyes on my GAA gear [PSNI GAA gear] as I attend for training.\"However ... you will see a number of civilian soccer teams using the facilities whilst wearing their Glasgow Rangers soccer jerseys without issue.\"Around % of PSNI officers are currently from the Catholic community, while Catholics make up around % of the population of Northern Ireland.In August, Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI was \"not yet back at the point\" where - recruitment of Protestant and Catholics was needed.The Chief Constable said he wanted to \"convince the people that hold me to account that we have tried every means possible to encourage people from both the Catholic community and also the working-class loyalist community, who I think need a stronger voice in policing\".The PSNI officer who did not wish to be named said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that at least  per cent of all new recruits placed in my district since the end of   are from a Protestant and or unionist background.\"With the lack of Catholic recruits presently, the number of gaels joining the PSNI is non-existent\".He said despite requests and other sports receiving financial support, players due to travel to New York this year for the Police Games have funded the trip themselves to the tune of £, each, which is subsidised by a small amount of sponsorship from GAA supporting businesses.\"All of these ongoing issues will bring an end to the PSNI GAA club,\" the officer said.A police spokesman said: \"PSNI officers are encouraged to join the GAA club, as well as other sports clubs, within the service.

Teachers have also remained within schools that primarily cater to the same background as their own, the report found.The findings, based on research by Ulster University, have been published in the British Journal of Educational Studies.Historically, Protestant and Catholic children have attended dferent schools - with most of the former attending controlled schools and the latter choosing Catholic maintained schools.Department of Education figures for the  academic year show that .% of those attending controlled schools last year were Protestant, % were Catholic and .% were either of other faiths or had no recorded religious background.The authors of the paper, \"Education policies and teacher deployment in Northern Ireland: ethnic separation, cultural encapsulation and community cross-over,\" found that just as there is separation of pupils, ided schools are staffed, on the whole, by a community consistent workforce of teachers. Northern Ireland has an exemption from fair employment legislation for teacher recruitment, allowing schools to preferentially employ teachers from just one of the communities.Matthew Milliken and his colleagues in Ulster Universitys UNESCO Centre wanted to determine whether more teachers in Northern Ireland were now teaching across the sectarian ide since the last study on this question was conducted back in .They designed an online survey and then contacted all the schools in Northern Ireland to request that teachers in both part-time and full-time roles complete it.To achieve as high a response rate as possible, the survey didnt ask respondents which community they identied with, but what type of schools they went to during their education, whether controlled, maintained or integrated. The type of primary school they attended was then used as a proxy for community identity.Just over , teachers completed the survey, representing around % of Northern Irelands teaching population. Their responses revealed that teachers in Catholic primary schoolswere most likely to have stayed within their community, with % of teachers having only attended and taught at Catholic schools. For teachers in Protestant primary schools, the figures were similar with % having only attended and taught at Protestant schools. In post-primary schools the figures were much lower - % of teachers at Catholic post-primary schools and nine per cent at Protestant post-primary.The study revealed that one in five teachers had no education experience outside their community of origin but around % were currently working in schools outside of their community of origin. Mr Milliken said further research is required to investigate whether this cultural encapsulation is hampering efforts to foster reconciliation between the two communities.\"This research has shown that the chill factor that was understood to have maintained the sectoral separation of teachers by religion community background would appear to have thawed to some extent,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland hotel defends staff for not stopping f the pope and the ira chants at wedding reception","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It wasnt until a suicide bid on the Foyle Bridge in his s that he discovered he was bipolar and started to receive help.As far away from the relentless pace of football as possible, his stunning wildle shots are the result of spending endless hours in wait for the perfect moment. From befriending a fox for months to waiting hours to see birds of prey, many thought the patience needed was beyond him.He said: \"You get a rush out of it which is hard to explain. I would get into a hide Ive made at am and still be there at pm and nothing turns up.\"If you told that to people they would think you were crazy. But its my way of clearing my mind as Im usually a  miles an hour with the bipolar.\"His first success came after waiting eight hours to see a kingfisher.\"I got just four frames and he flew off. The excitement of getting those photographs was unreal, it was nearly the same as scoring a goal for Ballymena,\" Dessie added.Still regularly working as a sports photographer covering football and GAA, he said his \"ultimate dream\" would be to travel to Canada to capture a brown bear fishing. He said an unhappy time at St Marys High School in Limavady created a hunger to prove himself early on.He added: \"I dont blame the school, but in those daysyou were disruptive you were kept in the corner and not allowed to do anything. That made me more determined and shaped the person I am today.\"Recalling his near suicide, he said it gave him a greater understanding of the struggles faced by others.\"If I ever heard of people committing suicide in the past I thought they were selfish,\" he said.\"But I was standing on the Foyle Bridge and didnt even know it. If I had stepped over the edge I wouldnt even have realised. I was driving to Derry and the only thing I could do was stop the van and walk over to the rails.\"The only reason it didnt happen was because somebody beeped the horn at me asto say: Get out of that state.\"He managed to drive back to the far side and call his we Anne-Marie for help.\"Im married  years now and I have the best we, shes unreal. \"She never says a bad word to me, I have the longest leash on the planet. She always says I work by the Moon - when its full Im not wise.\"After attending weekly cognitive behaviour therapy sessions for over two years, he now feels able to deal with his bad days.\"I always knew there was something wrong. I had all this energy and the energy had nowhere to go,\" he said. \"I still get days when Im down, but now I just grab the camera and just sit down and relax. I always tell the we where I am because I dont want her worrying. Butyou meet me theres always a smile on my face. Ive no exams but I can talk the leg off a donkey.

Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":null,"title":"foyleside student night set biggest best yet","story":" Magician Joel Mawhinney who will be performing mindblowing tricks to students on Foylesides Student NightThere will also be music from Q Radio, giveaways from Red Bull and VIP passes provided by Derry’s top student bars on the night to get students ready for some post-shopping drinks.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTo keep the students refreshed throughout their shopping spree there will be popcorn, slush drinks, a pick ‘n’ mix cart and doughnut walls – there really is something for everyone!Fergal Rafferty, Centre Manager of Foyleside, said: “For this year’s student night, we wanted to introduce entertaining and collaborative activities to get the students excited and encouraged to make great memories with their new peers – as well as grab a few bargains!

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable. This team has never put back-to-back championships and then all you have from everyone is that they are one-hit wonders, theyrsquoll get a championship this year, but sure next year itrsquoll not happen, he said.ldquoThey havenrsquot the heart for it, but they showed the heart they have. They are a serious team and there are some serious players in it. I think last year was a nervy final.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC. To date  UDR recruits have completed a four-week course at the camp.HORSE RACING mdash More than  entries have been received for the Ulster Cesarewich meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse on Saturday.The card produces another bumper programme, following on the heels of the successful August Bank meeting, and the entries have been split over six dferent races.The meeting again has had to depend on sponsorship, as the Downpatrick course continues to do what isnrsquot done anywhere  in the racing world mdash carry on racing without government support.Major William Brownlow, in his annual report recently, said that he was confident that racing would continue at Downpatrick mdash the second oldest course in Ireland mdash for at least another few years. It was dependent, of course on generous sponsorship, as the pound, grant from the government has been ended.He said the local tote would be continued, so that the profit could go back into the course.

With the leadership in the team it leaves me in no doubt they will give %, as always.Club PRO and coaching officer Gerard Lenaghan is also looking forward to Sundayrsquos showdown.ldquoI would like thank our management team and the players, especially for their dedication over the past nine months as we look forward to the final on Sunday with great anticipation, he said.ldquoThe squad has a good balance of experience and youth with an abundance of talent at their disposal. It would be remiss of me not to mention also our vibrant and hard-working executive committee who have taken a lot of the pressure off some of our footballers involved at committee level in the week to week running of the club.ldquoThe league success and now a first ever championship final is fitting reward for all our combined efforts both on and off the field. Tada gan iarracht is our club motto mdash nothing without effort, he aded.Bright chairman Marty Ranaghan, who played in several previous finals for the club, is convinced this is their year.ldquoFor many people number seven is a lucky number and hopefully this is our lucky seventh final. We are always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Not this time. We are walking up the aisle married to the cup, he enthused.ldquoFrom the start of the year the team have worked hard to get to where they are. I think the two best teams in the league are in the final and truly deserve to be there for their performances throughout the year.Team skipper OrsquoConnor canrsquot wait for the action to start.ldquoAs a local man born and reared in Killough, I know how important a win on Sunday will be for the Parish of Bright and canrsquot wait to get going, he beamed.ldquoUnfortunately, we narrowly lost out on winning the league and being promoted by only one point, but we can make amends for all that on Sunday.ldquoI am looking forward to seeing all the yellow and green flags on Sunday.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station. The extent and nature of this work will largely dictate the timeframe going forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd October 2019 Speeders.jpg","title":"Speeders ‘to face pupils in school trial’  ","story":"DRIVERS caught speeding past local primary schools could soon find themselves in front of pupils who will decide their punishment at a kidsrsquo court.As part of a radical new initiative being proposed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, drivers caught speeding outside a school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special court where the judges are children.Motorists who do not want to participate in the initiative will have to pay a speeding fine and accept penalty points on their driving licences.The idea of kidsrsquo courts started in England and now is being trialled in Northern Ireland. After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9411974.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

After he died I never went to a Manchester United game for a few years. I couldn’t face going over without him.“The last time I actually spoke to him was from Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid.“Faceman was a legend. Everyone liked him. He got on well with the fans, the players past and present. He was so friendly and down the middle.“I was talked into going back and bringing Big Lily in his memory.“All endeavours are dedicated to his memory.”The flag has many famous friends – from footballers including Gary Neville, Raul Gonzalez and Cristiano Ronaldo – to dignitaries such as Dieter Reiter, Lord Mayor of Munich, Mark Magowan, President of Western Australia and former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, all of whom contribute to an upcoming film about Big Lily.Speaking at Hotel Football at Malta Supporters Club Keith said: “Supporters from across the world love Big Lily for the passion she evokes and what she represents. “Manchester United’s -year-old Malta Supporters Club invited Big Lily to lead their anniversary celebrations in June and the club was first recipient of a ‘Wee Lily’ commemorative flag.“Big Lily was one of the main guests at the anniversary dinner along with Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, Wilf McGuinness and his son Paul. It was awesome.”Perth Manchester United Supporters Club – who in July hosted Manchester United’s pre season tour – had Big Lily lead a fans’ parade to the Optus Stadium.The club was also presented with a tribute flag with the words ‘Pride of Down Under’ emblazoned on it.

It was invited to a cremation in January.”The flag now features in the peace section of Belfast’s International Wall Mural where it will be viewed by many of the city’s . million annual visitors.The flags on the mural are from the dferent countries that the Big Lily flag has visited - Catalonia, Japan, Australia, America, Italy, Germany, Poland, Russia, Brazil, Spain.The mural will be part of an ongoing year-long documentary about the influence Big Lily has around the world.Keith said: “We have filmed amazing characters and events which portray the global passion for Manchester United in a unique manner. “This mural will be an integral part of the film and Big Lily’s journey. Further filming is scheduled for USA and Scandinavia. “We are seeking to attach influential movers and shakers in the film industry including global broadcaster and distribution partners”.“We started filming in Munich last year at the memorial service. Last year was the first year we took the flag.“Ronaldo is going to be in the film too as is Raul and Hierro.”Of the peace wall mural and documentary he said: “Big Lily represents Manchester United Supporters, irrespective of creed, colour or ethnic background. “Faceman would have been so proud, as I am, of this amazing tribute to Big Lily and the fact that we, in some small way, contributed to meaningful friendship across the ide in Northern Ireland and across the world. “To think of United’s Big Lily on a wall dedicated to peace and a tourist attraction is truly amazing. “The documentary will tell the story of Big Lily’s origins and many global footballing friendships through a shared love of everything Manchester United.”He said: “The flag is representative of the friendship between Martin and I. There’s a plethora of people involved who think the same way as we do. It’s not just hands across the ide, it’s hand across the sea.

Eight Manchester United ‘Busby Babes’ were among the fatalities.Real Madrid played five friendly games from  to  and the funds went to United to support the club after Munich.There are now a series of smaller tribute flags dedicated to Manchester United legends including George Best, Harry Gregg and Eric Cantona.Clubs who have an association with Manchester United have also been presented with ‘Wee Lily’ flags.They include Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Kyoto Sanga.Smaller versions of Big Lily have also been made for club stalwarts such as Jimmy Murphy, who carried the flag for Manchester United after the Munich air crash. There is also a tribute flag to the Busby Babes, which leads a procession each February at the site of the  crash in Trudering Riem, Munich.Keith, pictured above with Cristiano Ronaldo, said: “We now have  smaller flags all dedicated to our heroes. For example Harry Gregg, Gary Neville, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy.“I’m enjoying meeting so many people to present the flags. “Harry Gregg has been described a reluctant hero. He’s now a very good friend.“It’s moving when you see people like Harry Gregg getting emotional because we’ve made a flag with his name on it saying ‘Legend’.“We were at Liam Whelan’s grave in Dublin. His brother and sister took my hand and thanked me for keeping the memory of their brother alive.“It’s so deep, there’s so many layers to it. It’s those things that spur you on.”Christopher McCollumn was never more happy than when he was in Manchester watching his beloved Red Devils.The Bangor teen who became friends with many of the club’s players including David Beckham and Roy Keane died at the age of  from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.On the th anniversary of his death last month Keith Norris visited Christopher’s mum and dad Geraldine and Gerry to present them with one of the ‘Wee Lily’ flags to honour their son’s memory.Gerry said: “Christopher loved seeing Big Lily at the matches and looking out for it on TV.”“When I met Keith at unveiling of George Best statueI told him Christopher’s story and he asked could he feature it in the documentary that was being made.“When he came to our house to film he presented us with a Wee Lily flag and a letter from Ole Gunnar Solksjaer.”Christopher’s dad said: “His whole le was United. He wasn’t diagnosed until he was five but you could see he had problems. By age eight he was in a wheelchair. Even though he had this passion for football he never played. He was quite lucky because he started supporting United in the nineties whenever they were winning everything.”The first United player Christopher met was Lee Sharpe at ain the Europa Hotel and he fixed it for Christopher to come to a game at Old Trafford and meet the rest of the team at the club’s training ground. Further trips to meet the players were facilitated by coach Jimmy Curran.Such was Christopher’s relationship with the players that when he needed help to get a new wheelchair the family got a £, cheque from Gary Neville and Roy Keane.Gerry said: “Christopher said to me many times that he thought the players were his friends. So many of them knew him by name and made time to come and speak to him.“We always knew he had a le limiting disability though when he diedit did come out of the blue.“After Christopher died we were at a retirementfor Jimmy . Roy Keane came over and asked how we were coping with Christopher’s loss. There’s people in your street don’t say that to you. He’s somebody who Christopher admired for his determination.“He met David Beckham four times. On one of the occasions he was outside a hotel, he saw Christopher and came over. He didn’t have to come over. He remembered his name and asked him how he was.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

uprising continues","story":"Ms Lam urged foreign critics to accept that the four months of protests marked by escalating violence were no longer ldquoa peaceful movement for democracy.She said seeking Chinese intervention was provided for under Hong Kongrsquos constitution but that she cannot reveal under what circumstances she will do so. ldquoI still strongly feel that we should find the solutions ourselves.ldquoThat is also the position of the central government that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own butthe situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled outwe want Hong Kong to at least have another chance, she told a news conference.The protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial but have since morphed into a larger anti-government movement.Protesters say the bill is an example of Beijingrsquos increasing influence over the former British colony, which was promised a high level of autonomy when it ed to Chinese rule in .The unrest had pummelled tourism and hurt businesses in the global financial hub, further bruising the cityrsquos economy as it grapples with effects of the US-China trade war.President Donald Trump on Monday urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to ensure a ldquohumane solution in Hong Kong. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam  --He warned that any ldquobad outcome could hurt trade talks ahead of negotiations in Washington on Thursday.Hardening her governmentrsquos stance on the protests last week, Ms Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law to criminalise the wearing of masks at rallies but it fuelled more anger, with continuous daily violence over the long holiday weekend.Police officers last week fired gunshots while under attack from protesters, wounding two teenagers who were the first victims of police gunfire since the protests started.Enforcement of the mask ban began Saturday, and Ms Lam said it was too early to call it a failure.Two people have been charged with violating the mask ban so far, which is punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine upon conviction. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Riot police chase protesters  --Critics fear the emergency law, which gives Ms Lam broad powers to implement any measures she deems necessary, could pave the way for more draconian moves.Ms Lam said the government would make ldquocareful assessment before imposing other measures under the law, such as internet controls.She also pledged to continue dialogue and take steps to address livelihood and economic problems in a policy address due on October  when the Legislative Council resumes.Protesters stormed and damaged the legislative building on July , requiring repairs. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A man is helped by volunteers after getting caught by police pepper spray  --Ms Lam appealed for peace when the legislative session reopens, warning that further disruptions would set back the approval of bills and impede the cityrsquos development.The cityrsquos underground and trains, that carry some five million passengers daily, mostly reopened on Tuesday but will shut early amid fear of more protests.The entire MTR network was shut down on Saturday, with limited services the last two days.Video footages on local media showed masked protesters smashing windows of a train heading to mainland China late Monday as passengers screamed, the first time a train carriage was attacked.Protesters also threw objects on the rail track as the train pulled away. -- vw,vw,px,

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\". To achieve this, it is expected that the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid will need to double by .

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
