They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027Barbie Kitchen is among the 12 toys named as this year\u0027s...Iceland\u0027s banned Christmas TV ad could become UK\u0027s most...The one Christmas TV advert everyone ought to watch: SIMON...Sainsbury’s unveils its sweet Christmas campaign featuring a...The Aldi Christmas ad that will steal your heart: Santa...Share this articleHis husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said:  \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027.Shoppers might be disappointed to learn that there will be no plush toys available in Sir Elton\u0027s likeness this year, with the retailer instead selling four pianos - two uprights for around £800 and two keyboards starting at £150 - and a range of vintage tour t-shirts. The Boy \u0026amp The Piano will be released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight. The advert coincides with the start of ticket sales Sir Elton worldwide farewell tour and next year Taron Egerton will play him in Rocketman, the biopic film being made about the star, with his blessing, due for release next year.John Lewis says the movie and tour is unrelated to their choice of star and advert, which was filmed over the summer.          Sir Elton sings his first big hit Your Song in a present day gig but the advert goes all the way back to his 1950s childhood          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaireIt begins with Sir Elton, 71, gently tapping out the opening notes to Your Song before viewers are taken back through his life with scenes of him on stadium tours, travelling on a private jet, performing on Top of the Pops and recording the track - his first major hit - in 1970.Two adult actors, Oliver Marshall and Simon Burbage were chosen because they are the same height and build as Sir Elton.They were then transformed using prosthetics, his flamboyant outfits, glasses and even a mohican haircut.The advert, which was produced with the help of his husband David Furnish, then moves to a young Elton playing the piano in a local pub and performing in a school recital. And in a moving finale four-year-old Elton, played by young actor Freddie Henderson, is shown running downstairs to see his mother and grandmother where he unwraps a piano as a Christmas gift.It then cuts back to Sir Elton, who lost his mother Sheila at the age of 92 last December, looking tearful as he plays the same instrument.             Sir Elton, again using an actor, is shown performing Your Song on TV and then recording it for an album in 1970  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up  Elton, played by Hudson Trindall, is shown performing in a school recital watched by his family in an advert inspired by events in his life (pictured, right, Elton as a child)           The heart of the advert is revealed at the end as Elton as a young boy tears the paper from the piano in front of his grandmother and mother, played by Deborah Baxter and Katie Bonna (left to right)          The child actor looks in wonder at the musical instrument with the message that gifts can inspire and change lives      John Lewis has moved away from cuddly toys this year and fans of the advert can enter a reproduction of Sir Elton\u0027s lounge now built in its Oxford Street store          The music studio where Your Song was recorded has also been lovingly rebuilt in the Oxford Street where shoppers can touch the mixing desk and play the grand piano          As part of the experience Elton\u0027s 1970s dressing room is open to the public where they can try wigs, glasses and his clothes  Classic tour T-shirts will be sold in John Lewis store but there will be no cuddly toys or other similar gifts for the 2018 advert  Remember these? Moz the monster, Bouncing Buster, the Man on the Moon, Montie the penguin and a lovestruck snowman - EVERY John Lewis ad from the past ten years2017 John Lewis\u0027 2017 Christmas advert has left viewers in tears over a mischievous and flatulent monster called Moz and  his relationship with a seven-year-old soulmate - with fans comparing it to Disney\u0027s much-loved Monsters Inc.The giant furry monster with a bulbous nose, wonky teeth and a love of snoring, jumps out from under the bed every night to play with companion Joe in a festive tale making many  laugh and cry.The little boy, aged 7, who is played by young twin brothers from London named Ethan and Tobias, is initially frightened after seeing a pair of enormous eyes peering from the dark under his bed.But the two unlikely friends are shown sharing games, playing piggyback and Scalextric in his bedroom – all without mum, dad, or older sister finding out.Moz then leaves his friend as he realises the little boy needs to grow up without him and wraps a farewell gift for him under the Christmas tree - a nightlight to help him sleep.Elbow performed The Beatles\u0027 Abbey Road masterpiece Golden Slumbers as the soundtrack.2016 Last year\u0027s star was Buster the Boxer and his trampoline antics.John Lewis said the advert where the dog, played by five-year-old Biff, beats a young girl to her new toy is their attempt to cheer up Britain after a \u0027tough year\u0027.The advert told the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to jump.Set to a cover version of \u0027One Day I\u0027ll Fly Away\u0027, her mother and father buy her a trampoline, toiling while she sleeps to build it before hiding it in the garden to surprise her with on Christmas Day. As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room. The finished product ends up creating a shadow that looks like a woman walking her dog through the snow, accompanied by the tagline: \u0027Whoever you\u0027re looking for this Christmas.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Charles marks 70th birthday milestone family photograph","story":"Pick polka dots like the Duchess of Cambridge in Alessandra RichSold out!

Estimates vary on how many members it has. It secured 62 signatures on a letter to the PM in February while Mr Baker has claimed the group has a bloc of 80 Tory MPs willing to vote against May\u0027s plans.The group\u0027s deputy leader Mark Francois said today there were at least 40 hard liners who would vote against the deal in all circumstances. What do they want?  The ERG has said Mrs May should abandon her plans for a unique trade deal and instead negotiate a \u0027Canada plus plus plus\u0027 deal.This is based on a trade deal signed between the EU and Canada in August 2014 that eliminated 98 per cent of tariffs and taxes charged on goods shipped across the Atlantic.The EU has long said it would be happy to do a deal based on Canada - but warn it would only work for Great Britain and not Northern Ireland.The ERG say the model can be adapted to work for the whole UK. They say Northern Ireland can be included by using technology on the Irish border to track goods and make sure products which don\u0027t meet EU rules do not enter the single market.They also say it would give complete freedom for Britain to sign new trade deals around the world to replace any losses in trade with the EU.  The group is content to leave the EU without a deal if Brussels will not give in.  How will they vote:  Against the Prime Minister.          Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG counts Boris Johnson, David Davis and other former ministers including Steve Baker and Iain Duncan SmithModerates in the Brexit Delivery Group (BDG) and other LoyalistsWho are they? A newer group, the BDG counts members from across the Brexit ide inside the Tory Party. It includes former minister Nick Boles and MPs including Remainer Simon Hart and Brexiteer Andrew Percy. There are also many unaligned Tory MPs who are desperate to talk about anything else. How many of them are there? There are thought to be around 50 members in the BDG, with a few dozen other MPs loyal to the Prime Minister   What do they want? The BDG prioritises delivering on Brexit and getting to exit day on March 29, 2019, without destroying the Tory Party or the Government. If the PM gets a deal the group will probably vote for it.It is less interested in the exact form of the deal but many in it have said Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan will not work.Mr Boles has set out a proposal for Britain to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) until a free trade deal be negotiated - effectively to leave the EU but stay in close orbit as a member of the single market. How will they vote?  With the Prime Minister.           Tory Simon Hart leads a group of Tory MPs committed to getting a pragmatic Brexit deal without pandering to ideological interests Unrepentant Remainers in the People\u0027s Vote Who are they? A handful of about five Tory MPs - mostly former ministers - who never supported Brexit and think the failure of politicians to get a deal means Parliament should hand it back to the people. The group includes Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening. What do they want instead? A so-called People\u0027s Vote. The exact timing still needs to be sorted out but broadly, the group wants the Article 50 process postponed and a second referendum scheduled.This would take about six months from start to finish and they group wants Remain as an option on the ballot paper, probably with Mrs May\u0027s deal as the alternative. There are established pro-Remain campaigns born out of the losing Britain Stronger in Europe campaign from 2016. It is supported by Tony Blair, the Liberal Democrats and assorted pro-EU politicians outside the Tory party. How will they vote? Hard to say for sure. Probably with the Prime Minister if the only other option was no deal.            Anna Soubry is in a small group of unrepentant Remainer Tory MPs who want a second referendum on Brexit The DUP Who are they? The Northern Ireland Party signed up to a \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Conservative Party to prop up the Government.They are Unionist and say Brexit is good but must not carve Northern Ireland out of the Union. How many of them are there? 10. What do they want? A Brexit deal that protects Northern Ireland inside the UK. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister if the deal breaches the red line, with the Prime Minister if she can persuade them it does not. The group currently says No.      The DUP, led in Westminster by Nigel Dodds (right), have a deal with Theresa May but could still vote agianst her Brexit deal Labour LoyalistsWho are they? Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders. How many of them are there? Between 210 and 240 MPs depending on exactly what Mr Corbyn orders them to do. What do they want? Labour policy is to demand a general election and if the Government refuses, \u0027all options are on the table\u0027, including a second referendum.Labour insists it wants a \u0027jobs first Brexit\u0027 that includes a permanent customs union with the EU. It says it is ready to restart negotiations with the EU with a short extension to the Article 50 process.The party has six tests Mrs May\u0027s deal must pass to get Labour votes. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister\u0027s current deal.            Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders are expected to vote against the Prime Minister Labour Rebels Who are they? A mix of MPs totally opposed to Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership, some Labour Leave supporters who want a deal and some MPs who think any deal will do at this point. How many of them are there? Up to 45 but possibly no more than 20 MPs.What do they want? An orderly Brexit and to spite Mr Corbyn.How will they vote? With the Prime Minister. Other Opposition partiesWho are they? The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Caroline Lucas and assorted independents.How many of them are there? About 60 MPs.How will they vote?

It was Kirby – real name Jacob Kurtzberg – who first began working for the company, then called Timely, which would later be rebranded Marvel. He was industrious and had grown up in the Jewish ghettos of New York’s Lower East Side, and he could churn out artwork at an incredible rate.While he was drawing, Lee was initially sweeping floors and doing other menial tasks before he was given broader duties of scripting and writing. Meanwhile, the comics industry was struggling and even vilified by popular culture, when many believed that the plots were contributing to juvenile delinquency. Kirby had left to work for rival DC Comics as Lee was given more and more responsibility, and when the company was on the upswing in the late 1950s, he accepted more work from what would become Marvel – and Lee also hired artist Steve Ditko, who had worked with Kirby.It was the beginning of a fruitful, if fractious, era for the men and the company.Lee was becoming a larger and larger personality in the comic world, and – a frustrated writer who dreamed of one day writing the Great American Novel – continued to plot and script stories. But the work was increasing and becoming too much. He began delegating more, and the ‘Marvel method’ was born.Stan Lee\u0027s daughter J.C.

I think there was some slight magic that came into effect when we worked together’          Author Sean Howe, who published book Marvel Comics: The Untold Story, wrote that Lee \u0027wanted the panels to function like silent movies, to minimize the need for verbal exposition. Ideally, the artists would also contribute their own narrative ideas – characters, subplots – to the stories’While Lee began giving Kirby more credit – though his name, of course, appeared first – it wasn’t long before the artist, too, jumped ship. He went to work for rival DC in 1970 and, although he eventually returned to Marvel five years later, the rancor between the prolific co-creators would remain evident for decades to come – as evidenced by the 1987 radio interview in which both Lee and Kirby attempted to civilly congratulate each other.‘I created the situation and I panelized him, I did him panel by panel and I did everything but put the words in the balloons. But all of it was mine except the words in the balloons,’ Kirby said, before Lee called in. Nearly three years after that interview, the artist also told The Comics Journal that Lee ‘never created anything new after’ he’d departed Marvel, adding: ‘If he says he created things all that easily, what did he create after I left?’Kirby died in 1994, and his heirs came to an undisclosed settlement with Marvel in 2012 Ditko was found dead in July in his New York apartment at the age of 90. Comics fans marked and mourned the deaths of all three after Lee passed away earlier this week – though their legacies remain a bone of contention among many.Others, however, are happy to credit the collective creations of the men Hellboy creator Mike Mignola, for example, tweeted: ‘You can debate forever who really created what – Stan or Jack or Steve – but the truth is it was some magic combination of those guys.’The trio, tweeted long-time comics writer J.M.

The document says Northern Ireland would align with all single market rules so goods can circulate freely within the EU – but with no influence over them. Where EU law is applied, the European Court of Justice will remain \u0027ultimate arbiter\u0027, Government notes on the deal say.The terms of the backstop say UK officials will be responsible for policing EU law that still applies in Northern Ireland after Brexit – but EU officials can demand to be present.The laws are likely to regulation on products made in Northern Ireland and sold in the Republic.The European Court of Justice will be in charge of disputes about EU law that applies in Northern Ireland.Britain will take part in any cases at the ECJ as if it were still a member state, the document says.Both the EU and UK will have the right to say the backstop should end because a new trade deal makes it irrelevant.But neither side can act on it without agreement of ministers on both sides within six months.  After nearly five hours of behind-closed doors discussions, the PM declared that she will press ahead with her controversial planTransition period extension The Withdrawal Agreement confirms a Brexit transition period - during which EU laws will continue to have effect in Britain - lasting until December 31, 2020.However, the deal allows Britain to request an extension to the transition period \u0027at any time\u0027 before July 1, 2020.An extension could allow Britain and the EU more time to reach a final deal over the Irish border.In his press conference after Mrs May\u0027s announcement Michel Barnier said the transition period could only be extended once.The Northern Ireland backstop would only kick in if no final agreement had been reached at the end of the transition period, the Government said.During the implementation period EU laws made in Brussels will continue to apply to Britain and the UK will be bound by the EU\u0027s international agreements.The UK is also expected to \u0027make a contribution to the Union budget\u0027 in 2019 and 2020 and until the end of the transition period.In addition, decisions of the European Court of Justice will continue to have \u0027binding force\u0027 in Britain, according to the agreement.    The DUP has already condemned the blueprint and suggested it could withdraw support from the PM (party Arlene Foster is pictured today)  Exit clause   Mrs May has won her bid for an independent panel – a \u0027joint consultative working group\u0027 – to decide on when the customs union backstop can end, to stop the UK being \u0027trapped\u0027. Under Article 20 of the Protocol, the UK would notify the EU if it believes the backstop is no longer needed.Within six months, the panel would decide if the EU was not acting in good faith over a solution to the Irish border problem. Designed to ensure the EU could not unreasonably block the UK from leaving the backstop, it is still well short of the unilateral break clause many Cabinet ministers wanted.The panel will be made up of two representatives from each side plus an independent person – likely to be judges. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox – who proposed the solution – reportedly suggested the solution is not legally watertight. However, senior government officials insisted there have been major changes to the text to ensure the backstop is temporary.Regulations The price the UK has paid for this customs backstop is to agree to swathes of EU rules designed to ensure a \u0027level playing field\u0027 and contained within a \u0027large annexe\u0027 to the agreement. Mrs May has said she wants the UK to follow a \u0027common rulebook\u0027 for goods and farm products in the trade deal.But the agreement is expected to cover many others including state aid rules – subsidises for industry – workers\u0027 rights, competition policy, environmental rules and tax, which Brexiteers, and some Remainers, warn means following Brussels regulations that we cannot influence.Divorce bill  The UK will pay around £39billion, but payments will become due over time – such as pension payments for EU officials. Half the cash pays for a \u0027transition\u0027 period between now and the end of 2020, when very little will change and the UK will stay within EU rules and institutions. Designed to avoid a Brexit \u0027cliff edge\u0027, this period will allow negotiations to resume on the future.Calls from Cabinet Brexiteers for the cash to be linked to the future deal appear to have failed. For the first time, the UK has accepted the transition period may have to be extended – but only once – before we move to the future relationship. Freedom of movement and citizens\u0027 rights Ending freedom of movement was a key demand for many who voted Leave, and will happen at the end of transition. Future immigration rules were not included in negotiations, so the UK has flexibility to set its own after that point, although the EU will push for preferential treatment in return for a better trade deal. The existing rights of the three million EU citizens living in the UK and the one million Britons living in Europe have been guaranteed.Fishing  The deal on fishing is a win for Mrs May and will allow the UK to independently negotiate access to its waters and quota shares. Member states such as France and the Netherlands whose fishermen access UK waters demanded continued access.Instead, fishing terms will be negotiated separately during the transition. The EU will call for continued access in return for giving the UK market access to sell its fish products, where the British industry exports around 75 per cent of its haul.Thirteen Scottish Tory MPs including Scotland Secretary David Mundell said yesterday they could not support a deal that \u0027would prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares\u0027. No agreement has been made on import tariffs, meaning the EU could hit UK fishermen with charges for selling on to the continent.Trade  The deal is expected to contain only a brief \u0027political declaration\u0027 on future trade arrangements running to around five pages and which is not legally binding. Ministers hope this will be beefed up in the coming days before MPs are asked to vote on the deal next month.Both sides have agreed that there will be zero tariffs and quotas on trade between both sides, which No 10 says is a victory. One senior official said the UK would be \u0027the only major advanced economy\u0027 with that relationship with the EU.On security, an agreement has been reached to share number plate information, fingerprints and DNA records but not the data on wanted criminals. "},{"url":null,"title":"Lonely yes intent saw critics says QUENTIN LETTS","story":"Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street following a marathon Cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon in which she said she had won backing for her Brexit deal It had been a day of smouldering silences, despair and political vacuum – much like the May premiership from day one, really.

Before that Mrs May had to attend Prime Minister’s Questions. She entered the Chamber at 11.56am, helmet-coiffed, her lipstick a gash of scarlet. She was greeted by a few desultory cheers from Tory Remainers. From the far end, where the Leavers sat: deafening nothingness.Her formulaic opening – ‘This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues’ – drew laughter from Labour MPs. Was ‘meetings’ a euphemism for ‘screaming rows’?Jeremy Corbyn tilted at her Brexit plan, talking about the destruction of her ‘red lines’. Mrs May repeatedly said her plan would ‘take back control of our borders, our laws and our money’. By now most MPs had seen the cover of George Osborne’s London Evening Standard which showed Mrs May ensnared by EU stars and the headline ‘EU takes back control’. Ouch. The fury of a vengeful man.          Theresa May speaks at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised her Brexit plans Eurosceptic Peter Bone (Con, Wellingborough) had a question high on the Commons list. Mr Bone is often a jocular figure but not yesterday. There was a tremor of anger in his voice. He told Mrs May ‘if media reports about the EU arrangement are in any way accurate, you are not delivering the Brexit people voted for and today you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters’. Apart from a sole heckle of ‘cobblers!’, the House sucked in oxygen. Mrs May looked a bit pop-eyed and after a second’s pause there was a ballyhoo in the House. The force of the moment was wrecked by an intervention from Speaker Bercow. Mrs May recovered her poise to insist that she was indeed delivering the referendum’s result. Mr Bone rotated his thumbs and clenched his jaw.All this time, at the back of the Chamber, stood Boris Johnson, leaner and tidier these days, a crowd of colleagues around him. From time to time he shook his head or wrinkled his face in apparent disbelief at her claims. I was put in mind of Michael Heseltine in the House one other November day, 28 years ago at Mrs Thatcher’s last PMQs.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox looked in briefly, standing behind the Speaker’s Chair, his ears pinned back. He soon left, Brexiteer Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt in his wake. The only person to be pro-Mrs May at PMQs was Europhile Ken Clarke (Con, Rushcliffe).For much of the time Mrs May was in the Chamber, she was calm, even flinty. Yet there came a moment when she was having a private talk to Speaker Bercow, right in the eyeline of my sniper’s position in the gallery, and I caught a look of bleak exhaustion on her face. And that was before her five-hour steeplechase with the Cabinet.In the wild, wicked world beyond, Tony Blair was tarting himself round TV rolling-news, complaining that her Brexit would keep us tied too closely to the EU – something snake Blair has schemed for all along!A Tory MP chum said the mood in the Commons tea rooms by 5pm was volcanic.

Another accused the pensions minister of \u0027going mental\u0027. A third source in the room said the row led to the meeting ending on a \u0027sour note\u0027. Sir Mark eventually produced a copy of the ‘Cabinet manual’ which governs proceedings in No 10 to prove it is the Prime Minister’s role to declare a majority if it is clear that one exists. Miss McVey is now on resignation watch - with colleagues saying they would not be surprised if she decides to go.Just after 7pm - three hours behind schedule - Mrs May emerged from Downing Street to declare the deal had been signed off.But her reference to a \u0027collective\u0027 decision rather than a unanimous one immediately raised eyebrows amid reports that numerous ministers had raised objections.    Environment Secretary Michael Gove (left) is said to have backed the deal with a \u0027heavy heart\u0027, while Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom voiced deep misgivings about some elementsDominic Raab, Michael Gove, and Geoffrey Cox were described as backing the plan \u0027with a heavy heart\u0027. Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was thought to be among those closest to quitting, demanded assurances from the premier on key points. Defence Secretary Gavin Willliamson also expressed reservations about elements of the deal, as did Liam Fox, Jeremy Hunt and Andrea Leadsom.  Mrs Leadsom allegedly asked \u0027whether we are actually leaving\u0027 and whether the deal would lead to the break-up of the union. She was said to have told Cabinet that if Mrs May continued with the plan, the European Research Group ‘would end up having a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister’, which was reportedly rebuffed by energy minister Claire Perry. Home Secretary Sajid Javid is understood to have asked whether there was any chance of trying to toughen up the exit clause from the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 - but did not press the issue conceding that the negotiating team was best place to know what could be achieved. Mr Javid also reportedly called for continuing plans for a no-deal Brexit in case the House of Commons rejects the plan, the Times reported. Jeremy Hunt is said to have voiced similar fears, saying as many as 66 Tory MPs could vote against the deal, but said the PM was in a \u0027difficult situation\u0027. Regulatory border in the Irish Sea, an INDEFINITE transition...Share this articleCommons Leader Andrea Leadsom is also said to have wiped away a tear as she warned the proposals had little chance of getting through Parliament. Meanwhile Liz Truss said ministers were \u0027caught between the devil and the deep blue sea\u0027 as they discussed the plan, which includes a transition period that could be extended beyond December 2020.  There are fears over Miss McVey\u0027s future and rumours also swirling about Mr Raab\u0027s intentions.

It ended with a convivial glass of wine. Brexiteer nerves were calmed by attorney general Geoffrey Cox, who told ministers that any bid to keep Britain in the controversial ‘Irish backstop’ indefinitely would lead to legal challenges.Mr Cox reportedly called the plan an ‘ugly sister of a deal’.

She’s just on a completely different planet.\u0027But he says the craziness started just months after his daughter had been born. And he claims her eccentricity is so well-established that teachers at her Montessori school have ditched her real name and simply call her Crazy. \u0027She was three months old was when we first started to take videos of her and that’s probably when the craziness started,\u0027 he said. \u0027There was a video where she was dancing on our window sill and that was the first video we put on Instagram.          Daisy has been entertaining Alan since she was three months old, which is when he says the craziness started \u0027The videos I take are not staged, I don’t plan any of them and she’s actually a very shy person until you get to know her - like any three year old. I think she warms to people.’He put a stop to any doubters who believe that \u0027Crazy Daisy\u0027 is mimicking her parents as they feed her instructions.  \u0027A lot of questions are being asked and comments saying she must be imitating me and Michelle, my wife, but she actually isn\u0027t,\u0027 he said. \u0027Even with the phone call in the video - we genuinely wouldn’t be on the phone like that because we don’t have a landline. So it’s just in her little head that’s she’s coming out with all these things.\u0027But whatever the origins of his daughter\u0027s fame, he\u0027s glad she is recognised for bringing joy to people and says her viewing figures are close to 36,000. \u0027The big thing for us that it made people happy, made them smile or made their day,\u0027 he said. \u0027Daisy does that for us every day and it’s lovely to come home to that because they grow up so quick.\u0027The minute-long video features Daisy displaying an impressive range of facial features.           The youngster is known online as Crazy Daisy - or simply as \u0027Crazy\u0027 - to the teachers at her school She tells her through the phone: \u0027I am very hungry and I was thirsty and all, like.

I thought I was going to die there.\u0027Breeden, who has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, was joined by other mentally impaired adults and their disability checks were stolen by Weston.She now focuses on her art and  three children, two of whom were born in captivity.Her youngest child, Ava Olivia, lives with Breeden and Breeden\u0027s parents in Kensington. \u0027She means everything to me.

She was also forced to drink her own urine.She testified that she was regularly beaten with bats, sticks and chains, shot with a BB gun, and held in a trailer where Weston brought \u0027older mans\u0027 to have sex with her.The woman told the court that she is working to build a relationship with her children, who found out in 2011 that she was their biological mother.  Federal prosecutors Richard Barrett and Faithe Taylor, who were both involved in the case, argued that the heinous deeds constituted hate crimes because Weston and her partners targeted people with disabilities who could not care for themselves.Faithe Taylor told NBC10: \u0027If you were a man, she would be your girlfriend. If you needed a mother, she would be your mother.\u0027Over the course of a decade, Weston moved her victims from a trailer in Texas to an attic in Virginia before eventually landing in Northeast Philadelphia.          Prosecutors Richard Barrett (left) and Faithe Taylor (right) said it was the worst case they ever encountered  and described the scene as \u0027the worst thing you could ever see\u0027   Gregory Thomas, 47, (left) and Eddie Wright, 49, (right) were also accused of stealing the victims\u0027 Social Security checks          Weston\u0027s daughter Jean McIntosh was sentenced to 40 years in prison for her role in a decade-long plot to kidnap mentally disabled adults, enslave them and steal their government benefit checksLinda Weston\u0027s daughter, Jean McIntosh, 38, was also sentenced to 40 years in prison for her role in kidnapping, torturing and enslaving disabled adults in August 2018.Prosecutors counted at least a dozen victims throughout that time, including some who died in captivity. Others like Breedon gave birth in captivity as well.‘Some of the victims recount children they had that there is no record of,\u0027 Taylor said. They recount other victims we could not trace.\u0027Authorities said Weston forced two female victims into prostitution to earn more money for the family when they lived in Texas and Florida.Two other women died while living with Weston, leading to murder charges that made her eligible for the death penalty.

Weston allegedly staged the death to look like an overdose.When the charges were filed, Weston had already served time for the starvation death of a man she locked in her Philadelphia apartment nearly three decades ago.In September, Weston pleaded guilty to 196 criminal counts, including kidnapping, racketeering conspiracy and murder in aid of racketeering, hate crimes, sex trafficking and fraud in exchange for prosecutors agreement not to pursue a death sentence.  They instead recommended her current sentence.Weston has been in custody since October 2011, when a landlord found the four bedraggled adults locked in a squalid boiler room of a home in the Tacony section of northeast Philadelphia and called police.

In theory, she needs to win a simple majority, 159, to survive. But it is not that simple. When her predecessor John Major was challenged by John Redwood in 1995, he won by 218 to 89. But most agreed if Redwood had scored 100, Major would have been finished.Despite Iain Duncan Smith’s fighting talk that her ‘days are numbered,’ it will not be easy for IDS and his European Research Group Brexiteer Tories to get her out.

The MPs would whittle the candidates down to two – with a final vote by all Tory members.Davis could capitalise on Tory MPs’ mistrust of Johnson. One or the other could face Javid or Hunt in the party membership play off.There is one issue that unites Conservative MPs at present: fear of another General Election. However, some of Boris Johnson’s supporters say that if he became Prime Minister, he could call a snap election on a ‘no deal’ Brexit manifesto, and if he won, make a Churchillian stand against Brussels with the nation – and a Parliamentary majority solidly behind him.There is one problem with this: when Mrs May called a snap election last year she very nearly handed the No.10 key to Corbyn.And Conservative MPs and voters fear that more than any – or no –Brexit deal. The Tory leadership tangle was summed up by Paul Goodman, editor of the influential ConservativeHome website.He said: ‘Having a leadership contest could present more problems than it solves for the Party.’ However, he offered little comfort to Mrs May: ‘It is easy to say Tories calling for her to go are like the boy who cried wolf. In the end, the wolf came.’  CAN Theresa May get the votes to pass her Brexit deal through Parliament? PM could need the support of more than FIFTY hardcore Tory Brexiteers AND Labour rebels If Theresa May gets Cabinet backing her deal will have to go to Parliament She can only be certain of around 230 votes but needs to get 318 MPs in favour  PM  needs to squeeze Tory rebels, win over the DUP and get some Labour votesBY TIM SCULTHORPE, DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR FOR MAILONLINETheresa May has secured her deal in Brussels but her fight to get it actually in place in time for Brexit day is just beginning.If the Cabinet agrees to the deal the biggest hurdle will be the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the plans in Parliament.  This is expected to take place in December to ensure the deal is over its biggest hurdle before the end of the year.   Theresa May will need 318 votes in the Commons if every single MP turns up. She can only rely on about 230 votes - meaning she will need to get back around half of the 80 hardcore Tory Brexiteer rebels and secure the support of the 10 DUP MPs, plus dozens of Labour MPs   Theresa May has secured her deal in Brussels but her fight to get it actually in place in time for Brexit day is just beginningThe Prime Minister needs at least 318 votes in the Commons if all 650 MPs turns up - but can probably only be confident of around 230 votes. The number is less than half because the four Speakers, 7 Sinn Fein MPs and four tellers will not take part. To win, Mrs May will need to get back around half of the 80 hardcore Tory Brexiteer rebels and secure the support of the 10 DUP MPs.Even then she will probably still need the help of dozens of Labour MPs to save her deal and possibly her job. This is how the House of Commons might break down: The GovernmentWho are they: All members of the Government are the so-called \u0027payroll\u0027 vote and are obliged to follow the whips orders or resign. It includes the Cabinet, all junior ministers, the whips and  unpaid parliamentary aides.How many of them are there? About 150. What do they want? For the Prime Minister to survive, get her deal and reach exit day with the minimum of fuss.Many junior ministers want promotion while many of the Cabinet want to be in a position to take the top job when Mrs May goes. How will they vote? With the Prime Minister. Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG)Who are they? Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG counts Boris Johnson, David Davis and other former ministers including Steve Baker and Iain Duncan Smith.How many of them are there? Estimates vary on how many members it has. It secured 62 signatures on a letter to the PM in February while Mr Baker has claimed the group has a bloc of 80 Tory MPs willing to vote against May\u0027s plans.The group\u0027s deputy leader Mark Francois said today there were at least 40 hard liners who would vote against the deal in all circumstances. What do they want?  The ERG has said Mrs May should abandon her plans for a unique trade deal and instead negotiate a \u0027Canada plus plus plus\u0027 deal.This is based on a trade deal signed between the EU and Canada in August 2014 that eliminated 98 per cent of tariffs and taxes charged on goods shipped across the Atlantic.The EU has long said it would be happy to do a deal based on Canada - but warn it would only work for Great Britain and not Northern Ireland.The ERG say the model can be adapted to work for the whole UK. They say Northern Ireland can be included by using technology on the Irish border to track goods and make sure products which don\u0027t meet EU rules do not enter the single market.They also say it would give complete freedom for Britain to sign new trade deals around the world to replace any losses in trade with the EU.  The group is content to leave the EU without a deal if Brussels will not give in.  How will they vote:  Against the Prime Minister.          Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG counts Boris Johnson, David Davis and other former ministers including Steve Baker and Iain Duncan SmithModerates in the Brexit Delivery Group (BDG) and other LoyalistsWho are they? A newer group, the BDG counts members from across the Brexit ide inside the Tory Party. It includes former minister Nick Boles and MPs including Remainer Simon Hart and Brexiteer Andrew Percy. There are also many unaligned Tory MPs who are desperate to talk about anything else. How many of them are there? There are thought to be around 50 members in the BDG, with a few dozen other MPs loyal to the Prime Minister   What do they want? The BDG prioritises delivering on Brexit and getting to exit day on March 29, 2019, without destroying the Tory Party or the Government. If the PM gets a deal the group will probably vote for it.It is less interested in the exact form of the deal but many in it have said Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan will not work.Mr Boles has set out a proposal for Britain to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) until a free trade deal be negotiated - effectively to leave the EU but stay in close orbit as a member of the single market. How will they vote?  With the Prime Minister.           Tory Simon Hart leads a group of Tory MPs committed to getting a pragmatic Brexit deal without pandering to ideological interests Unrepentant Remainers in the People\u0027s Vote Who are they? A handful of about five Tory MPs - mostly former ministers - who never supported Brexit and think the failure of politicians to get a deal means Parliament should hand it back to the people. The group includes Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening. What do they want instead? A so-called People\u0027s Vote. The exact timing still needs to be sorted out but broadly, the group wants the Article 50 process postponed and a second referendum scheduled.This would take about six months from start to finish and they group wants Remain as an option on the ballot paper, probably with Mrs May\u0027s deal as the alternative. There are established pro-Remain campaigns born out of the losing Britain Stronger in Europe campaign from 2016. It is supported by Tony Blair, the Liberal Democrats and assorted pro-EU politicians outside the Tory party. How will they vote? Hard to say for sure. Probably with the Prime Minister if the only other option was no deal.            Anna Soubry is in a small group of unrepentant Remainer Tory MPs who want a second referendum on Brexit The DUP Who are they? The Northern Ireland Party signed up to a \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Conservative Party to prop up the Government.They are Unionist and say Brexit is good but must not carve Northern Ireland out of the Union. How many of them are there? 10. What do they want? A Brexit deal that protects Northern Ireland inside the UK. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister if the deal breaches the red line, with the Prime Minister if she can persuade them it does not. The group currently says No.     The DUP, led in Westminster by Nigel Dodds (right), have a deal with Theresa May but could still vote agianst her Brexit deal Labour LoyalistsWho are they? Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders. How many of them are there? Between 210 and 240 MPs depending on exactly what Mr Corbyn orders them to do. What do they want? Labour policy is to demand a general election and if the Government refuses, \u0027all options are on the table\u0027, including a second referendum.Labour insists it wants a \u0027jobs first Brexit\u0027 that includes a permanent customs union with the EU. It says it is ready to restart negotiations with the EU with a short extension to the Article 50 process.The party has six tests Mrs May\u0027s deal must pass to get Labour votes. How will they vote? Against the Prime Minister\u0027s current deal.           Labour MPs who are loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and willing to follow his whipping orders are expected to vote against the Prime Minister Labour Rebels Who are they? A mix of MPs totally opposed to Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership, some Labour Leave supporters who want a deal and some MPs who think any deal will do at this point. How many of them are there? Up to 45 but possibly no more than 20 MPs.What do they want? An orderly Brexit and to spite Mr Corbyn.How will they vote? With the Prime Minister. Other Opposition partiesWho are they? The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Caroline Lucas and assorted independents.How many of them are there? About 60 MPs.How will they vote? Mostly against the Prime Minister - though two of the independents are suspended Tories and two are Brexiteer former Labour MPs.      The SNP led by Ian Blackford, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Caroline Lucas and assorted independents will almost all vote against Theresa May         "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Philip 97 spotted leaving birthday celebrations Prince Charles","story":"    The Duke of Edinburgh was pictured leaving Buckingham Palace celebrations for the 70th birthday of Prince Charles The Duke of Edinburgh was one of the guests to turn out for Prince Charles\u0027s 70th birthday party last night.The frail 97-year-old - who retired from Royal duties last year - was absent from the Cenotaph service for the first time in 20 years on Sunday, but was able to join well-wishers at Buckingham Palace last night.He was spotted leaving the celebrations in the second sighting of the Duke this week.Prince Philip joined the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as well as Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge at the palace where the Queen paid a touching tribute to her son.She said Charles was a \u0027dedicated and respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history — and a wonderful father\u0027.

That period was a bit of a blur and Annabel’s was just a vortex.From 1973 to 1980, I worked outside Annabel’s, the London club on Berkeley Square. Everyone went there back then: Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson, Joan Collins, even Princess Diana. I would stand with Nando the doorman, a great guy with this big moustache, and wait for people to leave. Nando and I used to keep each other company, though he never told me who was in there. He was discreet like that.My nights started at 10.30pm and finished at 2am. I was young enough to handle the hours. I didn’t get inside until the 1980s: it was a big moment and you had to earn your stripes. Once the celebrities got to know you, they realised you weren’t such a bad old fruit. You just had to put your best suit on, smile and blend in. It wasn’t that difficult to approach people. They knew I’d be there and they would be friendly.My big break came in 1975. Liz Taylor was throwing a 50th birthday party for Richard Burton, whom she had just remarried. It was at the Dorchester and I was sent by the Evening Standard to get a picture. Every photographer had been turned away but I hid behind an assistant and slid in through some glass doors.The room was empty except for the DJ. I told him who I was, he handed me some records and showed me how the DJ booth worked, so I could pass unnoticed. Suddenly the room filled up with Richard’s friends, who had all come from Wales. Then the cake got rolled in. I got some pictures of the pair of them blowing out candles and I suppose I got confident, because I followed them to the dancefloor.I never asked if I could take some pictures, I just shot them. Liz turned to me and, in this soft tone, said: “I don’t know who you are – get out.” That was the beginning of a lovely friendship. I sent her the birthday pictures and, after that, she invited me to all sorts of events, from the Chelsea flower show to when she became a dame in 2000.I shot on black and white until the mid-1990s and kept using film until the end of the decade. Most of my early pictures were with a Leica M4. Even after the advent of digital, I continued shooting with Leicas. I preferred what you got and the way they handled: they’re small and unobtrusive, fitting easily into my pocket.It’s difficult doing this job for a long time. Some of my dearest friends have gone: Freddie Mercury, George Harrison, and of course Liz. It’s got to the point where I’m running out of people. My heyday ran from 1970 until 1995. That was when there was money in the industry and people took us seriously – we weren’t out on the streets being paparazzi.The whole industry has changed now. Everyone has a cameraphone and the way celebrities are photographed is intrusive. Today, I only go somewhere if I’m commissioned. Otherwise I stay at home and watch Tottenham on TV. I’d rather become a cab driver than start doing this now. I’ve had breakfast with Nelson Mandela, lunch with the Dalai Lama, but I’d still like to have dinner with Bob Dylan – if only to find out where he gets his suits from.• This photograph will be auctioned for charity at Christie’s on 20 November with other shots from Annabel’s, 1963-2018.

Here’s what some of you saidI was blessed to meet him a few years ago, when I was costuming as Wolverine. At that time, multiple sclerosis had really taken a grip on me, and Stan took the time to step away from his photo shoots, sit me down and have a lovely chat. I’ll never forget, when thanking him for filling my childhood and beyond with tales of such amazing superheroes, he told me that people like me in his words, who put disability aside to help others and push through adversity, “were the true superheroes”. Those words stay with me every day. Bless you Stan for being such inspiration. tachikomaI had reading difficulties when I was in primary school back in the early 60s, but over time managed to understand the text and speech bubbles in comics more easily than pages in text in books. Thanks, Stan, for being one of the people who taught me how to read when my school couldn’t and for being one of the creators who gave me a world of amazing characters to engage with at a time when I was a pretty lonely little girl. I still read comics, but also became a voracious reader of books because of them. Madeleine WolfeStan Lee saved my life. Possibly. When I was six, a car hit me as I crossed a road (the man was on green, so I ran. Look both ways, kids!). Just before it did, I tried to jump, as Spider-Man had done in the comic colouring book I had just read. He got a bit higher than I did, having recently been bitten by a radioactive spider, but my tiny leap might have been the difference between flying over, as I did, and going under. Or it could have made no difference at all. But my point is RIP Stan, thanks for the magic. guyfmI was lucky enough to meet Stan a few years ago at a convention in London. He was clearly frail and needed help to walk and steady himself, but seemed overjoyed that so many people had come out to see him and support his work. His enthusiasm for his fans made him appear much younger than the 90+ years he was at the time. Although the meeting was brief and consisted little more of a few words, a handshake and a photograph it was an unforgettable experience. It was a rare opportunity to meet a man whose work had a profound impact on my early life and must be considered among the 20th century’s most influential writers and creators. Marc Casson, college lecturer, north WalesGrowing up in war-torn Belfast, I was lucky for two reason: the local library at the bottom of my street, and my father as a merchant seaman, bringing home a suitcase filled with American comic books, from New York, every trip to sea. I rarely attended school, for numerous reasons, but learned the love of words through Stan’s writing. I always wanted to be a writer, even though I knew I could never become one because of my working-class background. Then I listened to Stan’s advice: “The only advice anybody can give is, if you wanna be a writer, keep writing. And read all you can, read everything.” So I did, and I am! Thank you Stan, warts and all. Sam Millar, writer, BelfastMy favourite recent cameo of his was from the Spider-Man game that came out a few months ago. You tend to expect cameos in all Marvel movies but for some reason the cameo in the game took me by surprise. Even though it was an animated version rather than his actual likeness, it captured all his charm and I was grinning like an idiot when i saw it. Turns out it’ll be the last one released before his death. Fitting that it was Spider-Man. RIP Stan. dsk84A huge escapist part of my otherwise anxious and sometimes fear-driven childhood. I know he sometimes blurred the details of who created what, with Kirby and Ditko especially, but even if he just mostly left him and the others to get on with it, to later become the brash salesmanfront man, he must have been doing something right. Though he didn’t always make the best business decisions. But thank you Stan, for brightening up my young world. PP100I thought it would be nice to share my father’s memories of Stan Lee with you along with a photo of the A1 size drawing of the superhero Stan and Herb Trimpe created during a 1975 BBC Pebble Mill at One interview. Personally I am a life long Marvel fan, as are “Seymour-Man’s” grandchildren so the fact that their grandpa is not only their real life superhero but also a Stan Lee created Marvel one is priceless. The following is my dad, David Seymour’s, fond recollection of Stan’s visit to the Pebble Mill studios:“In 1975, I was a BBC reporter and television presenter working on a daily network magazinetalk show on BBC One called Pebble Mill, named after the the broadcasting centre in Birmingham. I vividly remember interviewing Stan Lee during his visit to the UK, promoting the Son of Origins, which described the creation of several Marvel Comic superheroes. Stan was a great guest both on and off the set. He was helpful, charming, talkative and inventive. It was an extended interview and Stan decided to transform me into a new type of superhero.“I was young, British, black-haired and, Stan claimed, clearly suitable for transformation. It’s 43 years ago, and I forget now what superpowers Stan endowed me with, but as we talked live on British TV, the Marvel artist Herb Timpe sketched out the the new creation: he was called Seymour-Man. I have the sketch to this day, signed by its creators, Stan and Herb. It graces one of our guest bedrooms at home in Northumberland and has always intrigued our grandchildren. Sadly, I never developed the super powers that Stan had described. But now, silver-haired, I’m still Seymour-Man.” Ben Seymour, 42, Newcastle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b7c5de6b16c53c52520ff54d4432787be9caa7/104_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c96e36e09b07ba3f4cbd7b5ed188b31","title":"elton john brings star quality john lewis christmas advert","story":"Festive extravaganza charts performer’s path to stardom set to his Your Song anthem After a decade of heartwarming tearjerkers starring a menagerie of lovable furry animals, John Lewis has resorted to old-fashioned star power to sell Christmas this year with a star turn from Sir Elton John singing his Your Song anthem.The department store chain’s festive adverts have become entwined in the Christmas tradition thanks to its marketeers’ ability to spin gold with a back catalogue of emotional ads that has included Monty the penguin, the sad tale of a lonely man on the moon and Moz the monster.This year the ad men and women sifted through 300 scripts before alighting on one that unites two national treasures to spur Christmas shoppers into action at a time when the high street is under mounting pressure.The number of empty retail premises in UK town centres climbed by more than 4,400 in the first six months of this year. According to the British Retail Consortium, about 85,000 retail jobs have been lost this year as 1,000 retail business entered administration – ranging from big chains such as Maplin and Poundworld to small independent traders.The John Lewis advert is bookended by the singer performing Your Song at his first piano in what is supposed to be the sitting room of his London home. The two minutes 20 seconds in the middle chart his path from school and pub gigs in the London suburb of Pinner to pop megastardom, complete with technicolour outfit changes that include a stars and stripes sequinned suit and pink mohican.With a little poetic licence the ad traces the singer’s musicianship back to the Christmas gift of a piano in the early 1950s, when the then Reginald Dwight was growing up under the watchful eye of his mother and grandmother. One scene, which re-enacts him nervously playing at a school recital, is expected to bring tears to the eyes of thousands of parents of would-be musicians.“We’ve been doing John Lewis Christmas ads for some time now and what’s on my mind is how we move it on creatively but hold on to the heart of what makes them special,” said Craig Inglis, the customer director at John Lewis \u0026amp Partners. “I hope audiences will watch this and really enjoy the national treasure that is Elton John.”John Lewis, which is part of the employee-owned partnership that also owns Waitrose, has had a tough year with its stores making a loss in the first six months. Some analysts have questioned the logic of pressing on with grandiose brand-building after the annual staff bonus fell to the lowest level in 64 years.Against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence going into Christmas, retailers have taken a more Scrooge-like approach this year with total spending on TV advertising expected to decline by £44m to £1.43bn, according to Advertising AssociationWarc figures. Cash is instead being erted to ads on social media.Struggling rival Marks \u0026amp Spencer has changed direction after last year’s advert, starring Paddington Bear, failed to move the dial on sales. Instead its ad, featuring the TV presenter Holly Willoughby, is designed to shift party outfits and knitwear rather than make Britons feel warm inside.Ellen Hammett, a reporter at Marketing Week, said John Lewis had stuck with the big emotional storytelling that is its calling card but that it felt “more like a biopic of Elton John’s life”. She added:“I liked it, but that’s probably more to do with the fact I like Elton John than anything to do with Christmas or John Lewis. It will be interesting to see how it goes down with the general public.”John Lewis says it blockbuster Christmas ads are an important investment and thus far have been among the “most effective marketing campaigns in the industry”.With a £300m fortune, John – who is on a 300-date retirement tour – can afford to shop in luxury stores, but he professes to be a John Lewis regular, with some Dartington crystal glasses his most recent purchase.The superstar, who has two young sons with his husband, David Furnish, described the ad as “absolutely fantastic”. “The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family. I’ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.”John Lewis’s ads have traditionally reworked a classic tune, and it is the second time Your Song has been used – the 2010 ad used a cover version by Ellie Goulding. But this time we get John singing his first major hit.Other songs featured this year include his Step Into Christmas, which is being used in a series of shorter product-focused ads.The main ad, which airs on ITV at 9.15pm on Thursday, does not rely on product placement. Shoppers will not be able to buy his embroidered silk dressing gown or tinted glasses, but John Lewis is rising to the occasion with a range of pianos. Prices start at £150 for a keyboard but if there is a really promising musician in your family there are upright pianos costing more than £800."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c00c89ac15b85af216c67fc01644a7b6fe3e435/0_410_3577_2146/master/3577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd5bde6d0d971523cb1147fabcec6fa7","title":"70 prince charles queen step aside","story":"He has at least four magnificent homes. He has 134,000 acres. He’s a duke. He’s an earl. He’s a lord. He has a lovely wife, who cheers him up. He has two handsome sons, each of whom has a beautiful wife. He has three grandchildren who adore him. He has an awful lot, this mild-mannered Englishman who turns 70 on Wednesday. Oh, and he has a rich mum. He has a really, really rich mum. I wonder what she’ll give him for his birthday?Since 1976, Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland, has been helping young people into work. The charity he founded, the Prince’s Trust, has helped more than 900,000 young people into education or employment. But his own apprenticeship has gone on for a very, very, very long time.Charles was four when he watched a man put a gold object on his mother’s head, in a ceremony watched by more than 270 million people. Almost everything that has followed in his life has been shaped by that object, studded with 40 rubies, 40 sapphires and 63 pearls, an object so heavy, as his mother said in a TV programme earlier this year, that it could “break your neck”. It was the reason he married a young girl he didn’t love. It was the reason he didn’t marry the girl he did love, or not until he was 56 and she was 57 and so, so much water had passed under the bridge.He didn’t ask for a crown. His mother didn’t ask for a crown. His grandfather certainly didn’t ask for a crown. None of them asked for it, but if you’re born in a country that has the relics of a feudal system, to someone who has been unfortunate enough to have been born, or married, into the family that has to pretend they run it, you don’t get to choose. You can give it up, as Charles’s great uncle did to marry the woman he loved, but it doesn’t usually go down all that well.From the moment the prince learned that not everyone’s mum is called “your majesty”, he has known that he will one day have to wear that crown. What he didn’t know was that he would be waiting through his 40s, 50s and 60s. He didn’t know that he would be collecting his bus pass, and his pension (which he gives to an old people’s charity) that he would, in fact, spend his full three score and 10 waiting for something he didn’t particularly want and may not even get. He has spent his entire life being judged in the light of that thing he hasn’t yet got. Surely it’s now time to put that wait to an end.When the Queen promised, on her 21st birthday, to devote her “whole life, whether it be long or short” to the service of her country and her Commonwealth, she meant what she said. Day after boring day, for hours every day, she has shaken hands with people she will never see again. She has smiled and asked them if they have travelled far, and known that her boring day is a highlight of their lives. She has had to be polite to David Cameron. She has had to be polite to Donald Trump. She spends her mornings answering letters. She reads her “red boxes” late into the night. Last year she carried out 292 royal engagements. And she has done all this with dignity and grace.Last Sunday, at the armistice centenary, she looked tired. For the second time, she didn’t lay a wreath. Aged 92, she is still going relatively strong, but she can’t go on as strong as this for ever. She will get more tired and she will get more frail. We might see her shuffle. We might see her stoop. We might even see her memory fail. There are no signs of this yet, but more than a third of women over 90, according to some studies, show symptoms of dementia. For 66 years, the Queen has done a magnificent job in a terrible job. It’s hard to imagine a single human being in the world who could have done it better. It would be a terrible shame to see her do it badly now.Charles Philip Arthur George may not do such a good job. He has said he won’t send his famous “black spider” letters to ministers when he is king, and he shouldn’t have sent them before. But he does work hard. Last year, he undertook 546 royal engagements. He is patron of more than 350 charities. He supports the arts. He was an environmentalist long before it became fashionable. He is thoughtful. He is dutiful. And he is, according to many people who know him well, kind.That’s fine. That’s plenty. That’s more than enough. We have a man waiting to do the job he has been trained for all his life.

Now MPs get a glimpse of where Mrs May wants to go for the next two yearsFor years, Eurosceptics complained that EU membership depleted national sovereignty by imposing alien rules without parliament’s consent. That was always a misrepresentation, ignoring the influence that UK politicians and officials exercised in Brussels. But leaving the EU guarantees Britain loses its voice in the room where the rules are written, while still having to implement those rules to gain market access. Brexit engineers the very subordination that was cited as a reason for leaving the club. From what is known of the deal that Theresa May has agreed, it seems the UK will spend at least two years in rule-taking orbit around Brussels. This problem of “vassalage” is not Mrs May’s fault. There was nothing she could have done about an imbalance of power in a negotiation between one country and a continental bloc of 27.During the referendum campaign, Brexiters predicted that continental capitals would yield to pressure from their own exporters, eager to retain access to UK consumers. Pro-leave propagandists never understood the European project. The integrity of the single market and the principle of solidarity between states was more valuable to every member of the union than the bilateral trade with any “third country”. By surrendering its privileges as a member, the UK was never going to “take back control”. On the contrary, Brexit guaranteed that control would bleed away from Westminster, as has been the case since the moment article 50 was triggered.While there is much detail to be absorbed in several hundred pages of a draft withdrawal agreement, covering the two-year transition to an undefined future relationship, the compromises have been visible for months. To satisfy the prime minister’s determination to end free movement of people, the UK has excluded itself from the single market and so opted for an inferior trade relationship with the EU. In deference to the Good Friday agreement and the need for a frictionless Irish border, the UK will be in a “temporary” customs union. But that requires adherence to a common external tariff, which Brexiters see as an unacceptable curtailment of trading sovereignty. An escape clause has been included, the legal enforceability of which will be hotly debated in the coming weeks.Border control has been bought at great cost in every other sphere of control. Satisfying anti-immigration sentiment has trumped economic judgment. Mrs May believes that transaction was explicitly mandated by the referendum result and many MPs agree – perhaps enough to ratify the withdrawal agreement, although the numbers look tight. The government’s capitulation to rebels in a dispute over maximum stakes in fixed-odds betting terminals on Wednesday is a reminder that Mrs May has scant room for legislative manoeuvre. In that instance a cross-party alliance applied sufficient pressure to impose a sensible change of course on the government. There is no reason why the same mechanism should not also be available with a Brexit deal. Before “Brexit” was even a word, Euroscepticism was framed in terms of parliamentary sovereignty. Only in the aftermath of the referendum did anti-Brussels sentiment attach itself to the “will of the people” as a higher authority. That rhetorical shift allowed the prime minister to ignore parliament when defining Brexit priorities. But, 28 months later, it is unclear how Mrs May can justify her proposals on the basis of national will.The referendum result demanded the government negotiate an exit from the EU, but MPs must not allow the prime minister to aggrandise her deal as a sacred extension of that mandate. It is the culmination of a set of political choices built around the Eurosceptic tradition of misrepresenting the European project. While the negotiations have been ongoing, many of those hoary old myths have lingered. The advent of a concrete deal presents an opportunity for a more informed debate. MPs have a duty to measure Mrs May’s text not just in terms of whether it clears the bar of getting Britain out of the EU, but on a fuller test of service to the national interest. That means acknowledging damage that will be done by the prime minister’s plan – and admitting that many of those flaws are intrinsic to the very idea of Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75ad34ad7cd06de4a805e1e02928bf711701f62b/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75cbcf0b1a5ba13dd8e799efa3101a0a","title":"theresa may brexit deal solves nothing polly toynbee","story":"As rumours flew that her Brexiter enemies were calling for her head in no-confidence letters, out she stepped alone. After five gruelling hours convincing her cabinet, a beleaguered prime minister stuck to her friendless deal: sticking is what she does best.Now the arm-twisting, the bribery and the for-the-good-of-the-country cajoling of every last MP begins in earnest. Pinned to the wall, each must finally reveal their true colours some will be principled, some not: Tories must reckon if the future is with Theresa May and her deal, or with Brextremists in their constituencies. Any Labour would-be defector must reckon whether their local party could ever forgive them for voting to keep this government in power.Meanwhile, Brexit mis-selling continues unabated. In her statement this evening, May said that her deal would give us back “control of our money, laws and borders”, while protecting business and jobs. None of that is true. Nowhere is there any evidence to be found in the lengthy withdrawal deal.For the foreseeable, we are in a customs union we cannot leave without EU permission and our borders are open to EU citizens. We are paying £39bn, business has no certainty for future investment and as for jobs – well, let’s just cross our fingers and hope. May pretends that some distant sunlit trade deal, hazily sketched, will one day emerge from the political declaration that accompanies the deal. Will it be in two years, 10 years, sometime, never? No one knows.All the devilish dilemmas remain. All the impossibilities are as impossible as they were on referendum day – but now they are solemnly written down on paper. We can’t have frictionless EU trade without a customs union, but that stops us buccaneering the globe for those exclusive deals with Mauritania or wherever else Liam Fox chooses to turn to. Ireland stands where it did: preserving an open border, made possible by the Good Friday agreement, means the UK must stay close to the EU forever. Scotland is righteously rebelling: David Mundell, with his crucial 13 Scottish Tory votes in parliament, will not countenance continued EU rights to fish in our waters Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, protests at Scotland being denied Northern Ireland’s competitive advantage of effectively staying in the single market – a special status the DUP also objects to. Today takes us closer to fracturing the union.Remarkably, the deal has united arch-enemies of remain and leave: the European Research Group, Labour, SNP, DUP and the two Johnson brothers are all roaring the same song: give us back control. Good to hear Jeremy Corbyn at last voice full-throated opposition to the deal in PMQs today. That reminds us how powerful Labour’s voice can be once it seriously joins the Brexit battle. What opposition would not relish this chance to topple the government?Corbyn gave his best Brexit performance so far, with withering mockery of Dominic Raab’s discovery that Dover is rather important for 10,000 trade-bearing lorries a day. He reprised Jo Johnson’s deadly Brexit Exocet comparing the chaos to the Suez crisis, and he denounced May’s false choice between “a botched deal or no deal”. As a taster of what’s to come in the parliamentary vote, the theme is Britain is losing control.This is not the beginning of the end nor the end of the beginning. For those yearning to escape the nightmare of obsessive Brexitology, this will be the never-ending story. If parliament does vote this through, if we do depart on 29 March, then trade talks begin, churning over all the same old turf. The elastic transition will stretch into the far horizon, while the Brexilunatics bay at the moon still claiming a sudden-death clean break would magically solve all problems. If the economy falters, they will blame vassalage to Brussels, while remainers blame Brexit. In the battle for “I told you so”, the defining ide of a generation will never end.If, on the other hand, May fails to scrape a majority, Labour will push for a confidence vote. Such a monumental policy collapse should surely bring down a government and cause a general election? But unless the Tory schism drives them mad (which it might), their MPs will rally round: whatever the fate of their hapless leader, there will be no election. Instead factions will put up every other option – Canada, Norway, Switzerland and no-deal – but none commands a majority.Public patience may be stretched beyond endurance, but at least everyone will know the long-ago referendum promises were, well, let’s say economical with the actualité. What happened to “Take back control?” Yes, David Davis really did promise a Brexit with “the exact same benefits” with “no downside”. Liam Fox really did promise a free trade agreement would be “one of the easiest in history” and John Redwood and Michael Gove both said “the UK holds most of the cards”. In the cold light of day, the actual deal has blown away the fantasies.What then? As every option is beaten to a pulp, polls show people already think asking them is the right solution. Sardonic old Ken Clarke had the best last line today: “I wish the prime minister well in obtaining a majority for some course of action that is in the national interest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/066270bb479c8e4f726c215d01d6383832caae86/0_30_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fae5fab3959c910641e8236f4db5dd71","title":"theresa may britain mps brexit","story":"In the weeks to come, we will see what a ‘meaningful vote’ is worth – and how much muscle parliament has in the Brexit dealNot just one, but two vital meetings for the future of Britain’s relationship with the European Union took place on Wednesday afternoon in Westminster. The first meeting, generating more noise than news throughout a long day, was of Theresa May’s cabinet. Its importance was self-evident. The second meeting, also hugely significant, went wholly unnoticed. In its own way, though, it was equally crucial.The first meeting first. It has long been obvious that, on Brexit, May uses the free-at-last language of the Tory right while tacking at the last moment towards a deal with the EU. She did this in 2017 on the first withdrawal agreement. She did it in the summer at Chequers. Now she has done it a third time, proposing a deal in which Britain will try to remain economically aligned with the EU while having no say over its rules. A bad deal, it is now confirmed, was always going to be better than no deal. It is difficult to be surprised.Wednesday’s cabinet meeting was a long-planned effort by No 10. Its aim was to bounce other ministers into agreement with the prime minister’s deal. The ministers didn’t get the chance to read the agreement fully. They were given inidual briefings that flattered their self-importance. If the strategy succeeded – and most ministers bought in – it meant the Brexit deal would reach first base in the long process of ratification. It would also have momentum, making it harder to defeat.No 10 has shown some emotional intelligence this week alongside the political ruthlessness. It is easier to talk about resigning than to resign with a real deal on offer that, in all likelihood, all 27 EU member states will endorse. There was lots of talk on Tuesday and through much of Wednesday about who might walk out – almost half the cabinet, some normally sensible people suggested. But in the end?In politics, as in life, reality is different from theory. Human beings think they know about birth and death until the moment when they hold a newborn baby, or in which they contemplate a dead parent. In a similar way, a deal in practice has force that a deal in theory always lacks, especially when it is backed, not trashed, by both the Daily Mail and the Express. Yesterday, as ministers pondered, No 10 put its foot to the floor on the timetable – publication following in hours, a statement by May in the Commons on Thursday, an EU summit to sign off at the end of next week, a Commons vote early in December. Just like the first world war, it would all be sorted by Christmas.Meanwhile, Westminster’s second important meeting was going ahead under the radar. MPs have long been promised a “meaningful vote” on the package that May secured this week. Wednesday’s meeting of the Commons procedure committee will have done much to shape how that will work. At issue is whether parliament will have the tools and the will to take control of the Brexit decision and reshape it in the way the parliamentary numbers suggest is possible and that so many in and beyond Westminster want and expect it to do.Wednesday’s committee meeting under its backbench chair, the Conservative MP for Broxbourne and a leave campaigner, Charles Walker, was a private one. It took place for the limited purpose of agreeing (or not) the final text of a report that is expected to be published on Friday. On the face of it, the report will be tediously technical. But its soulless title, Motions under section 13(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, masks a question of raw political importance.That question is whether, in its meaningful vote, parliament has the muscle to do anything more than approve or reject May’s deal. If May had a working majority, the answer would be pretty obvious – approval. But she doesn’t have a majority, so the outcome isn’t obvious, and the scope of the procedure to be followed is therefore crucial for the many who oppose May’s deal and no-deal alike.Originally, the government tried to argue that the vote should be a “take it or leave it” choice. Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the withdrawal bill scuppered that last year. The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, then appeared, in a letter, to revive the original approach last month. Now, as May repeated at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the government’s motion will be amendable. But it is still not clear if amendments will be heard and taken first, as normally happens whether the government approval motion will come first, with amendments only taken in the event of rejection or whether all motions will be taken discretely.Among Britain’s 650 MPs there are groups that want a softer Brexit deal than May has secured, those who want a harder one, those who want no deal at all, those who want a second “people’s vote” referendum on the deal, and those who simply want a general election and a new government. Only a few of these positions can be confident of a majority. So the mechanics and sequencing of how these different interest groups get their chance to pitch for parliamentary backing – if they get that chance at all – are therefore a key factor in the politics of the next four weeks.This is where the procedure committee comes in. If it proposes an expansive timetable and process, in which all options are considered, the government could be in trouble. The Speaker, John Bercow, is said to be determined to ensure that all options, including the people’s vote, get debated and voted on. Bercow is definitely up for a fight with ministers who will try to stop the Commons from trying to bind the government.Even if Bercow gets his way, though, the sequencing of the different motions when they come to the vote, now expected to be around 6 December, will be vital. The people’s vote option’s best chance, for example, would seem to come only after all other options have fallen.If Labour’s general election motion is defeated early on in the process, as is likely, Labour must decide whether to whip its MPs in support of a people’s vote. It might, however, opt for the pro-single market Efta membership motion – known to some as “Norway for now” – that is backed by MPs in all parties (and by David Cameron) and could command a Commons majority. Labour’s crafty veteran chief whip, Nick Brown, will be a key player in all this.Most of the time, parliamentary procedure does not matter much in Britain’s politics. But the sudden arrival of a huge national moment in the shape of the Brexit deal, and the choices it poses, pitches it into the limelight. May’s deal means MPs now have to use Commons procedure to turn all that talk about meaningful votes into something that is, well, meaningful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f58c41ee15f2598593230025a1c01ed19a589e/0_4_4365_2619/master/4365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c35de2c6c523ff55ad8b2a704551d73","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

Welcome back to a place you loved, and where you were loved. The Ranieri of the Premier League, regarded in different moments as a gentleman, a tinkerman, a caricature joker, a miracle worker, an expert at somehow maintaining composure when form has faltered and the axe has lurked, returns with the words “risk free” ringing around him. Ranieri has seen enough in 32 years of management across five countries to smile wryly at such notions before he gets to work.Preconceptions have followed Ranieri around for long enough – way longer than the infamous reaction to his supposedly left-field appointment at Leicester City (and we all know how that turned out). A certain amount of optimism from the Fulham hierarchy, who chose Ranieri to follow Slavisa Jokanovic, is understandable. But there is no sense jumping to the question of whether Ranieri can recreate something resembling the phenomenon he oversaw at Leicester in his new role at Craven Cottage.Almost 18 months ago Ranieri joined Nantes in France among considerable fanfare. The president, the Poland-born tycoon Waldemar Kita, championed the idea that he masterminded a coup by recruiting a head coach associated with magic dust. Nantes had impressed under their previous coach, Sérgio Conceição, and when he left to join Porto Kita craved a big name. Ranieri more than ticked that box, so soon after Leicester’s Premier League heroics made them a touchstone for any modest club with giant dreams.Everyone in Nantes was excited. Everything started awash with promise. Ranieri was instantly popular with the public and inspired the team to climb as high as third in the table. They were settled in the top five for a while after the winter break. But by February the honeymoon picture began to crack. Neither party seemed in it for the long haul. Ranieri was linked with the Italian national team. Results started to slip. Over the course of the season Nantes scored only 36 goals from 38 Ligue 1 games and the initial spark of excitement fizzled out as bland football took hold.Freedom to work under an involved president became an issue. Kita is an extrovert face in French football, the type of owner who is full of grand statements, likes to befriend the players, doesn’t hide the fact he has favourites and relishes the kind of interest in team affairs that can border on interference. Ranieri never complained in public but it was obvious these were not his ideal conditions to coach. Three wins in the second half of the season meant that Ranieri’s departure after one season at Nantes was not unexpected. He remained elegant and liked but left without sensational memories. “The first part of the season was fantastic,” he said. “Then we were inevitably disappointed: me, president, players, supporters.”Expectations that he could do a Leicester with Nantes were always on the fanciful side. Partly because the law of averages that has a team succeed at odds of 5,000-1 suggests it is not likely to happen again in a hurry. And partly because Ligue 1 is not easy for those outside the establishment to crash through. Outside the usual suspects (the superpower Paris Saint-Germain, with Monaco and Lyon normally leading the sub-elite) the top three has seldom been gatecrashed in the past five years. Nice pushed their way to third in 2017 and Lille did the same in 2014.And so to Fulham. Even during that unforgettable adventure with Leicester, when his team were top a third of the way into that extraordinary season, he was fixated with reaching 40 points before he would even consider thinking about anything else. “Our goal right now is to maintain the Premier League. Be solid with two feet firmly on the floor,” he said then.Those sentiments echo along the banks of Thames as he begins his 18th job in management with his team in a parlous state. Rock bottom, haemorrhaging goals, having almost forgotten how to win, this is a job that requires that Ranieri characteristic of shaking things up quickly. He is a specialist at bringing a new manager bounce – that spurt of improvement – by sharply analysing his resources and making adjustments while trying to motivate. “I like a project,” he says. Just as well.Fulham represents a homecoming of sorts. Not only does it bring him professionally back to the Premier League, personally it also takes him back to a part of the world he enjoyed. He was very happy living in west London during his spell with Chelsea in the period that just preceded the arrival of Roman Abramovich.The variety of experience he has packed into his managerial career, having to cope with the twin imposters of triumph and disaster along the way, means he is under no illusions. “We have to play like we are desperate – not every match, every second,” Ranieri once said of his philosophy. “The day my players relax I get crazy. They know that. I think I am a nice man but also I am demanding.” Fulham’s chances of recovery this season depend on the extent to which his players will be able to respond to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/910a36275e21cb65799489f1fea94ea7891abde5/434_473_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbcfe127beeb3944391147ce68de916c","title":"fifa investigating five premier league clubs youth transfers possible ban","story":"Fifa is investigating five Premier League clubs over possible violations of rules on the signing of foreign players under the age of 18 with the quintet risking transfer bans if found guilty by the governing body’s disciplinary committee.Chelsea are one of those clubs, as reported by the  in January, and the French investigative website Mediapart reported on Wednesday that Fifa’s Integrity and Compliance unit would seek to impose a two-year transfer ban to stretch across four windows, and a fine of 500,000 Swiss francs. Mediapart is one of the outlets publishing documents obtained by Football Leaks.Chelsea released a short statement on Wednesday night saying they had “fully cooperated with Fifa and provided comprehensive evidence demonstrating its compliance with the applicable Fifa regulations”.Sources familiar with the Fifa investigation have confirmed that another four English top-flight clubs are running the risk of a transfer ban, along with high-profile clubs across Europe. The identity of the other English quartet has not been revealed, though Fifa confirmed in September 2017 that Manchester City’s conduct involving youth players was under review. The Premier League champions denied any knowledge of the situation at the time.In a statement, Fifa said: “As communicated in September 2017, investigations were opened concerning the club Chelsea FC as well as other English clubs in relation to potential breaches of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players. The proceedings are ongoing and, to date, no decision has been passed by the Fifa judicial bodies. Thus, the clubs are to be presumed innocent unless decided otherwise. No further information can be provided as the cases are ongoing.”Fifa’s rules prohibit the international transfer of players under the age of 18 unless their parents have emigrated for reasons unconnected with football, or if both the player and the purchasing club are based within 50km of a national border. There are exceptions relating to transfers within the European Union or European Economic Area.Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid have been found guilty of infringements related to the signing of minors, with Atlético and Barcelona serving a two-window embargo and Real’s similar punishment halved to one. The investigation into Chelsea was carried out by the compliance unit of Fifa’s transfer matching system (TMS), which was first alerted by the case of Bertrand Traoré, the Burkina Faso forward who now plays for Lyon. He was signed on professional terms by the Premier League club on 1 January 2014, the first day of the window immediately after his 18th birthday, despite being pictured playing in an under-18s game against Arsenal when he was only 16. The club subsequently admitted they had acquired a first-refusal option to sign the player in April 2011, with “the option agreement registered with, and approved by, both the FA and the Premier League”.Mediapart has suggested the Fifa investigatory body has proposed a fine of 500,000 Swiss francs and an embargo across four transfer window for offences relating to the recruitment of minors involving 19 players, including 14 minors who were illegally transferred. “We will not comment further on speculation concerning confidential contracts or player related matters,” added Chelsea’s statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822894c72dd405fe9506c2cc649723485faec17a/161_0_4332_2600/master/4332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c211344994a44da262cd53749b413a","title":"premier league richard scudamore 5m gift","story":"Public furore over a prospective £5m golden handshake payment to Richard Scudamore has cast a shadow over his last meeting as the Premier League’s executive chairman, despite continuing uncertainty over whether the payment will be made at all.Scudamore is set to chair his final gathering of the Premier League’s 20 clubs in London on Thursday. On the agenda are issues such as a potential cap on foreign players in the English top-flight after Brexit. Not on the agenda however is Scudamore’s parting gift, nor are there any plans to vote on it.That has not stopped the issue of the pay-off becoming a topic of continued debate, not only eclipsing Scudamore’s departure but the appointment on Tuesday of the Premier League’s new chief executive, Susanna Dinnage.Scudamore himself is said to feel embarrassed about the prospect of the gift, while the Premier League itself was unaware of the offer before reports appeared in the media. The idea was conceived by Bruce Buck, the Chelsea chairman who also chairs the league’s audit and remuneration committee, and put directly to clubs. Each has been asked to contribute £250,000 to the fund.Supporters’ groups across the country have expressed their displeasure at any such move, with the Liverpool organisation Spirit of Shankly describing the gift as “laughable, if it weren’t so infuriating”.Much of the criticism has concentrated on an apparent act of executive largesse at a time when the grassroots game in England is struggling and desperate for funding. The FA had to rip up a plan to construct 1500 new 3G pitches across the country last month when the proposed sale of Wembley was mothballed.Reports early on Wednesday claimed that at least five Premier League clubs were against making the golden handshake payment at all. Most have chosen to remain silent on the issue and it remains possible that the plan could be scrapped altogether.One club in favour of the gift, however, is Premier League newcomer Cardiff City. The club’s chief executive, Ken Choo, told BBC Wales that Scudamore deserved the money for the way he had transformed the competition into the world’s most popular football league."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd99b7a8bce670832d759f862cfbc900a5b1a24/0_0_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e95fb5c5e016d844b0d273c870e4e6","title":"world bank pulls 300m tanzania loan over pregnant schoolgirl ban","story":"Policy that denies schooling to young mothers cited among key reasons for withdrawing education fund The World Bank has withdrawn a $300m (£232m) loan to Tanzania, amid concerns about the nation’s policy of expelling pregnant girls from school.The money, a significant proportion of funding totalling $500m awarded to Tanzania by the bank in 2018, was scheduled for approval last month. It was intended to help Tanzania’s education ministry to improve access to secondary education.Tanzanian schools routinely expel girls who become pregnant, who are thought to number about 8,000 a year. The practice dates back several decades but has intensified since President John Magufuli took office in 2015. Some schools have imposed compulsory pregnancy tests on girls.The president went a step further in June, announcing that students would not be allowed to return to school after giving birth.In January, campaigners condemned the arrest of five pregnant pupils in the Tandahimba district, on the Mozambique border, saying that the men who impregnated them should be arrested instead.A source within the World Bank told the  that the government’s policy of expelling pregnant girls was among the reasons for the loan withdrawal.In an official statement, a bank spokesman said: “The World Bank supports policies that encourage girls’ education and make it possible for young girls to study in schools until they reach their full potential. The economic and social returns for girls finishing their education are very high in every society for both current and future generations.“Working with our partners, the World Bank will continue to advocate girls’ access to education through our dialogue with the Tanzanian government.”In 2017, a Human Rights Watch report concluded that the discriminatory policy contributed to 1.5 million children being out of school in the country.The source said other factors in the bank’s decision to withdraw the loan included misgivings over a new law, approved in September, that would make it a crime to question official statistics. Last month, the World Bank said it was “deeply concerned” about the amendment to the statistics law – which would impose a fine, at least three years in jail, or both – on those who questioned the accuracy of government figures.In addition, the World Bank has suspended all visiting missions to Tanzania, because of “threats, harassment and discrimination against the LGBT community”. Visits would not resume “until we can secure the safety and security of all employees”, the source said.Judy Gitau, the regional coordinator for Equality Now Africa, an advocacy group that has been lobbying to have the expulsions lifted, said: “Unfortunately, the taking away of $300m means all children will suffer. However, it is in the government’s hands to right the wrong, to lift the ban and to ensure the money does come in.“Most of the young girls who get pregnant come from a background of poverty. The implication of the ban is to deny these girls a basic education and relegate them to a cycle of poverty. The system endorses the view that girls are not as worthy as boys.”Tanzania has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the world, with widespread sexual violence and girls exchanging sex for school fees, food and shelter, according to the UN.Last December, Magufuli pardoned two child rapists who raped 10 primary school children, after serving 13 years of their life sentences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/10/01/HEADER_V2.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0e3bd63d2e72ba9feb2b727b1d428c0","title":"the auto innovations driving one of todays most technologically advanced cars","story":"Volkswagen’s new Touareg is packed with futuristic driving aids, including everything from night vision to an infotainment system controlled by gestures – and some models can even give you a massageGreat road trips are all about the drive – but the music you listen to is almost as important. And we all know that there’s nothing worse than a song you just can’t stand blasting through the speakers at the wrong moment, sticking with you for the rest of the day.Forget reaching for the car stereo control, fiddly buttons and complex menus though the new Volkswagen Touareg has a simpler solution to changing track – just wave your hand.The third-generation Touareg’s Gesture Control, which allows you to change audio tracks while using Spotify or to change preset radio stations, is just one of Volkswagen’s technological innovations that is making road trips – long or short – safer and more enjoyable.It’s this ethos to use technology that has driven the design of the Touareg to a “new time and dimension” of automotive advancement, according to Klaus Bischoff, Volkswagen’s Head of Design and the man responsible for putting Volkswagen’s latest technological innovations on the road.The new Touareg, he says, offers an alternative to the establishment with its pioneering and innovative technologies, versatility, and its excellent comfort and dynamic properties.He adds: “The design of the new Touareg makes it unmistakably clear that it is the dominant flagship of the brand. The power of this Volkswagen resides in its amiability and elegance – this car does not need to force anything.”Safety is key to that dominance, says Volkswagen. So the new Touareg boasts a string of class-leading developments that bring the future to the road today. These include a Night Vision system and IQ Light LED Matrix headlights that, when linked to the infrared system, illuminate, by a brief flash, any pedestrians in possible danger zones to make them even more visible to the driver. Perfect for when road trips go into the night.In fact, the new Touareg is “flying the flag” for all the latest technology flowing from Volkswagen’s labs and design studios in Wolfsburg, Germany, according to Brian Luckie, Product Manager for the car in the UK. “From its vast panoramic sunroof to its LED Matrix headlights with 128 LEDs per headlight, the new Touareg is one of the most technologically advanced Volkswagen vehicles to date,” he says.Inside, with its thoroughly modern Innovision Cockpit – which combines a 12-inch digital instrument cluster with a 15-inch touchscreen display on the dashboard – Volkswagen has completely redesigned the new Touareg cabin and infotainment offering. The two screens form a uniform digital landscape in “one-screen design” along a “single visual and operating axis”, while it also includes controls for the car’s four-zone air conditioning system and the operation of seat heating, ventilation and massage – available as optional extras – for comfort.All of this technology comes with a challenge, though. The rise of new technologies and autonomous cars, plus the heralded arrival of the mass-market electric car, is seeing the automotive industry undergo a period of profound change. Vehicles are becoming sensor-rich consumer devices, bristling with “intelligence” and connected to the world around then.But, as they become smart and more sophisticated, what does this mean for their drivers? And how will we safely make use of these technologies, rather than be plunged into a thick data-fog of distractions?Part of Volkswagen’s response is the Innovision Cockpit, which radically reduces the button count on the dashboard. It is also compatible with Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and MirrorLink as standard, making using your favourite apps easier and safer on the go. A driver’s head-up display can also be added as an option to project safety-critical information on the windscreen.Volkswagen has loaded the new-generation Touareg with one of the most advanced safety systems on the road today, trailblazing a future of safer motoring. For example, its optional Night Vision system detects humans and animals in the darkness, using a thermal imaging camera to see beyond the reach of the naked eye. And as with the mapping system, the result can be displayed in the instrument cluster. There’s also Roadwork Lane Assist, to help steer, brake and accelerate. This takes the new Touareg to a new level of automated safety and convenience, making it one of the world’s safest and most convenient cars.It is added to by the new optional extra of Front Cross Traffic Assist, which warns of vehicles approaching at a 90-degree angle – incredibly useful when pulling out at a tight junction or in a supermarket car park. The system will even intervene by engaging emergency braking if you don’t respond to an audible and visual warning on the Touareg’s dashboard.The combination of this futuristic technology, says Bischoff, means the new Touareg is “one of the most concise SUVs on the global market. Tailormade for freedom. That was our objective – no more and no less.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a295125e6f1afe6e4e547fbe5d945a68d56f6ca/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cd2d8d98bfad386143e6392637729e5","title":"from the human eye to hubble a brief history of our quest for better vision","story":"Technology today enables us to ‘look’ millions of light years across the universe, but up until 400 years ago we didn’t even have telescopes.

And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":null,"title":"support the guardian how to make the most","story":"Over one million of our readers have supported us financially, and there are a number of advantages to doing so – including getting closer to our journalists and reducing the number of requests you see on our articles supporters help us keep our journalism open for everyone through regular financial contributions, or single payments.

Here are some of the points that may cause problems for the prime minister, Theresa May, in parliament:The draft Brexit agreement says both parties will “use their best endeavours” to have a future trade agreement concluded six months before the end of the transition period in December 2020, but that if this is not the case the EU and the UK could “jointly extend the transition period” for an unspecified period.Otherwise the backstop solution for Ireland and Northern Ireland aimed at preventing a hard border would come into force. The backstop, consisting of “a single customs territory between the Union and the United Kingdom”, will apply from the end of the transition period “unless and until ... a subsequent agreement becomes applicable”.The single customs territory would cover all goods except fishery products, the agreement says, and will “include the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK”.There would necessarily be extra non-customs checks on some types of goods passing between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, which will not please the Democratic Unionist party who have consistently opposed any kind of differential treatment for Northern Ireland.On exiting the backstop, the agreement says that if “either side considers the the backstop is no longer necessary, it can notify the other” setting out its reasons. A joint committee must then meet within six months, and both sides must agree jointly to end the backstop.This part of the agreement would be difficult for Brexiters to swallow. They have consistently argued that Britain must be able to exit any all-UK customs union as and when it wants to be able to pursue free-trade deals around the world.The agreement says that under the backstop arrangement the UK must observe “level playing field” commitments on competition and state aid, as well as employment and environment standards and tax. These measures are intended to ensure that UK businesses are not able to undercut EU industry.Brussels has demanded “dynamic alignment”, which would oblige the UK parliament to simply cut and paste EU regulations as they are issued after Brexit. Britain must also transfer three EU tax directives into law – on the exchange of tax information, reporting on investment firms and the EU’s code of conduct on taxation.“Non-regression clauses” will also prevent the UK from bringing in lower standards on social, environmental and labour regulations such as working hours.Many of these requirements would also be anathema to Conservative Brexiters, for whom leaving the EU represented an opportunity to head towards a low-tax, light-regulation economy such as that seen in Singapore.This issue may be even more depressing for Brexiters. The future UK-EU relationship, which both sides have said requires much more work but aims to achieve a close relationship on services (including financial services) and investment as well as sectoral cooperation in, for example, transport, would “build on the single customs territory provided for in the withdrawal agreement”.The EU has repeatedly said that it would only allow British seafood exporters tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets in exchange for a reciprocal agreement that EU fishing fleets can continue to operate in British waters.This potentially explosive issue appears to have been kicked down the road: the withdrawal agreement essentially says only that the EU would apply tariffs on fish until a separate agreement was struck on access to EU fishing in UK waters.After the transition period ends, the final withdrawal agreement would be policed by a structure based on a joint committee taking decisions by mutual consent and whose verdicts would be binding.A five-member arbitration panel would be convened to manage disputes. Any issue relating to EU law, however, cannot be decided by the arbitration panel but must go before the European court of justice. That, too, would annoy Brexiters wanting to “take back control of our laws”.In another potentially controversial clause, the draft agreement gives London’s financial centre only a basic level of access to the EU’s markets similar to that enjoyed by US and Japanese firms. It would be based on the EU’s existing system of financial market access known as equivalence – a watered-down relationship that Brussels has said all along was the best arrangement that Britain can expect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7edd5073911d339fdd0594beab3d913262983d53/0_877_4006_2403/master/4006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82333013fc950d92d3db063c953fcb8d","title":"brexit diva theresa may sings cabinet encore at last","story":"Queen of referendum and blues manages to get her backing group to play the same tuneCall it a stay of execution. Theresa May exists on a different time scale to most ordinary people. While the rest of us try to plan weeks, months – sometimes even years – ahead, the prime minister has a much narrower focus. Minutes, hours and days. Just getting to the end of any given 24-hour period with her job still intact is cause enough for celebration. Even if the cold sweats are sure to begin again at dawn the next day.No wonder then that May seemed relieved – if mentally drained – when she eventually appeared outside Downing Street to give a brief statement. Her Brexit deal, which even she wasn’t sure she fully understood – other than it was better than no deal, worse than what the UK already had and nothing like what she had promised – had survived its first contact with her cabinet. She was still just about in the game.Not that it had been easy. Cabinet had overrun by several hours. Even Alun Cairns – who was he again? – had insisted on droning on. At length. Like all the others, pretending he knew what he was talking about. When it was clear no one did. Then Karen Bradley had needed to check on which bit was Northern Ireland and which was the republic. At which point the government cancelled the press statement only for the government to reinstate the press statement when it emerged that the government didn’t know it hadn’t cancelled the press statement. ITV had live broadcast pictures of the front door for more than five hours. Who knew chaos took quite this long? A metaphor for Brexit itself.“There had been impassioned debate,” May said, looking tight-lipped. As in severe reservations. Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey might still resign, but she could live with that. Both fell under the heading of acceptable collateral damage. Come to think of it, their departures might even be an unexpected bonus as she couldn’t remember them ever having done anything useful. If only Chris Grayling would do the decent thing as well, it would be a red-letter day.All the big hitters had stayed on board, though. Dominic Raab had become a pushover ever since his geography lesson and the rest had surrendered to her logic. Her deal was every bit as bad as she had always led them to believe it would be, so if they were to storm out in a strop it would rather imply they had never grasped the details.To make it a full house, the Four Pot Plants had more or less succumbed to her argument that the best way of showing you were taking back control was to hand it all back to the EU. After all, it was consensus of a sort if Remainers and Leavers both disliked her deal. Unity through disunity. Best of all, Tony Blair had even spent the afternoon calling her draft deal ‘a capitulation’. Nobody believed a word he said these days. Not even when he was telling the truth.Prime minister’s questions had also passed off without too much damage being inflicted. It could have been better, mind. It was just typical that Jeremy Corbyn had chosen this day of all days to ask about Brexit. Normally the Labour leader could be relied upon to use his six questions to cross-examine her about bus timetables at a moment of national crisis.But though Corbyn had managed to land a couple of glancing blows on the backstop agreement and the red ink that she had put through her red lines, here had nothing to cause her much grief. Certainly nothing that her uncanny ability to find different ways of failing to answer a question directly couldn’t handle. “Let me be clear,” she had said, as she went on to explain why everyone had always known that what they were voting for in the referendum was any deal she just happened to manage to agree with the EU. Her default denial algorithm was in perfect working order.There had been one minor alarm when Iain Duncan Smith had got to his feet, but it soon turned out that all he wanted was a complete reversal of government policy on the timing of the new £2 top rates for fixed odds betting terminals. That was no bother. Throwing Philip Hammond and Jeremy Wright to the wolves was an unexpected pleasure. All that mattered was the here and now. Just breathe. She’d got all her life to live. She’d got all her love to give. She had survived. She would survive. Until tomorrow at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5dce17f8bb5dffb8c90af657c1592304c94ad4/0_115_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a84224e1f46a85d6540a4b7ceaac1668","title":"theresa may wins cabinet backing for brexit deal","story":"‘Collective’ decision by ministers to press ahead – but Brexiters may back push for no-confidence voteMay takes draft Brexit deal to parliament – live updatesTheresa May will launch a high-stakes battle to sell her Brexit deal to parliament on Thursday, after clinching the support of her deeply-ided cabinet during a fraught five-hour meeting in Downing Street.Emerging from No 10 on Wednesday night, May said she believed “with my head and my heart” that her deal was the best one for the UK – and the only alternatives were no deal, or no Brexit.She said her ministers had taken a “collective” decision, to press ahead with finalising the deal in Brussels, which she will then have to bring back to parliament for approval but it was clear there had been significant dissent.There were a series of dissenting voices from Brexit supporting ministers, as the meeting overran its intended length by two hours. One Whitehall source said the environment secretary, Michael Gove, had been the only leaver to speak in favour.“This is a decision that was not taken lightly, but I believe it is firmly in the national interest,” May said, adding that cabinet had held “a long, detailed and impassioned debate”.Cabinet sources said Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, made the most impassioned interventions against the draft agreement and warned of chaos should the government lose a meaningful vote in parliament.May twice refused a request from McVey to hold a vote in the room. One cabinet source said that McVey was “shouted down” by the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill.Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said they were “caught between the devil and the deep blue sea”.Up to 11 cabinet ministers were said to have spoken out against the deal. Supportive voices came from the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, and the education secretary, Damian Hinds.Brokenshire, a close ally of May, said the prime minister should “follow her judgment”, and while Hinds expressed some reservations that there would be no unilateral way to withdraw from the backstop, according to a source he told ministers that the deal “has to be better than the alternative”.May will now face questions from sceptical MPs on the 585-page withdrawal agreement – effectively the orce deal – published on Wednesday night alongside a seven-page outline of Britain’s future relationship with the EU.Within minutes of the documents being published, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the ardently pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), had written to all his Tory colleagues with a detailed rebuttal, urging them to join him in voting it down.Amid rumours that Brexiters were sufficiently angry about the details of the deal to seek to trigger a vote of no-confidence in the prime minster as Tory leader, Rees-Mogg said he would “not be surprised” if colleagues did so.May took a defiant stance in her statement, insisting that “there will be difficult days ahead, this deal will come under intense scrutiny and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable.”She said: “What I owe to this country is to make decisions in the national interest and I firmly believe that, with my head and my heart, this deal is in the best interest of our entire United Kingdom.”Government officials highlighted what they claimed were a series of negotiating victories on the fraught question of the backstop – including “best endeavours” clauses, obliging both sides to make efforts to ensure it never comes into force.May drank a glass of wine with the cabinet before stepping out to speak on the Downing Street steps. No 10 denied any cabinet ministers had explicitly threatened to resign and said the prime minister had set the tone by acknowledging there were “difficult and uncomfortable” decisions that had been taken.The prime minister and her cabinet will now turn their attention to promoting the deal, to the public and their backbench colleagues.After the release of the deal, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark almost immediately convened a conference call with business leaders, to brief them on the details.No ministers resigned on Wednesday evening after the lengthy meeting broke up but there were fears that walkouts could follow.Julian Smith, the chief whip, would not comment on possible resignations, telling reporters outside the prime minister’s office in the Commons that it was “not surprising we had to have such a long cabinet” given the importance of the issue.The key May ally insisted that the meeting had been positive and was confident May’s deal would be approved by MPs, although he would not say when a vote would take place other than it would be “hopefully before parliament before Christmas”.Before the cabinet meeting, May held one-to-one meetings with key ministers – including Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom – on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning in a bid to assuage their concerns that the UK could slide into a permanent customs union with the EU.Scottish Conservatives, including the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, who attended the crunch meeting, had also sought assurances over fishing rights.Rumours were swirling at Westminster late on Wednesday that a fresh flurry of letters from angry Tories could be submitted to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, the mechanism to spark a no-confidence vote.Forty-eight Conservative MPs would need to back a no-confidence vote in\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspto trigger a leadership contest, according to party rules.The ballot is based on “one member, one vote”, but in 2016 one of the final two candidates, Andrea Leadsom,\u0026nbspwithdrew from the race\u0026nbspafter a\u0026nbspdamaging interview with the Times about the fact that May did not have children. Her withdrawal meant May was made party leader without having been elected by members.If the total number of such letters reaches 48, Brady would have to announce a vote – although more than 150 would need to vote against May to formally topple her.While all eyes have been on the cabinet’s reaction to the draft deal, it has also been met with expressions of serious concern among key member states, including France, which was expected to demand further concessions.Brussels was expected to confirm that it would convene a special EU summit to sign off on the deal on 25 November, after EU ambassadors held their own lengthy meeting on Wednesday.The final deal, to be put to MPs, would include the full text of the political declaration on Britain’s future trading relationship, some aspects of which have not yet been negotiated.Cabinet ministers have only seen a seven-page outline of this political declaration, along with 585 pages setting out the withdrawal agreement – effectively the orce terms.Several Brexiter ministers were unhappy about the terms of the deal. One senior leaver said it was “worse than expected”, while another said: “Several people are not in a happy place.”However, securing the support of her cabinet for now would allow May to press on with putting the agreement to MPs in a “meaningful vote”, likely to be held early next month.The parliamentary arithmetic looks tight. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP), whose 10 votes the Conservatives rely on for their majority, rubbished the deal before it had even been published, with the party’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, describing it as a “punishment beating”.The DUP have been wary of any arrangement that gives Northern Ireland a different status to the rest of the UK.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he agreed with May that the publication of the draft withdrawal agreement and political declaration constituted “decisive progress”. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, published a letter to the European council president, Donald Tusk, recommending the convening of a special Brexit summit later this month.Barnier warned, however, that it would be difficult to translate the provisional agreement into a final deal given the fierce opposition in some quarters. “The path is long and it may well be difficult to guarantee an orderly withdrawal,” he said, as he called on the UK parliament to “assume its responsibility”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17665658d3786878351d11fcc0b123f29d9bda6f/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b854e75b8a7c014f84be269c1336dde","title":"splits cracks and difficult days what the papers said may cabinet meeting","story":"The prime minister may have secured cabinet approval, but few felt that point was the main storyThursday’s front pages feature an impressive variety of treatments of Theresa May’s Brexit agreement but the overwhelming majority are united in casting doubt on the prospects of the deal and the prime minister herself. sums up the scale of ision that reigns, with the headline: “May Brexit plan: a split cabinet, a split party and a split nation” and mentions the 11 dissenting voices at Wednesday’s cabinet meeting.The Daily  omits Boris Johnson from its front page and uses May’s own words to describe the situation: “There will be difficult days ahead.” It talks of the prospect of a leadership challenge in the intro, and also gives plenty of space to criticisms of the deal by Nick Timothy, the prime minister’s former chief of staff.The Times says May “papers over the cracks” and suggests she used the threat of no Brexit at all to force ministers to agree to her draft agreement.The Daily Mail continues its coverage in a post-Dacre era with a remarkably upbeat front page.

It is a far cry from its celebration of the referendum result, all that time ago.The Mirror homes in on the ministerial isions with “War cabinet” and claims 40 Tory rebels are plotting to bring her down.The Financial Times plays it straight, saying May has won cabinet support for her deal after “ferocious debate” and now faces a fresh battle in parliament. Its image choice is a side-on view of May bent forward as she makes her very lonely-looking speech to the nation. presents the issue as a binary options, with a simple “Back May or sack May”.The Express paints the rosiest picture as far as May is concerned, with no mention of leadership challenges or cabinet troubles, referring only to a “stormy five-hour meeting”. “It’s my deal … or no Brexit” is the headline.The Scotsman carries a dim view of May’s remaining time in office and mentions Nicola Sturgeon’s view on the deal, saying: “UK must return to the negotiating table.”The National gives more prominence to Sturgeon and says May is clinging on to power alongside a slightly spooky image of the PM walking out of No 10.Online, the  goes the way of the , quoting May on the “difficult days ahead” and focusing on her words rather than the struggles she faces.

So take the next three hours to have a well-deserved break from politics, and hopefully get some sleep.Thanks so much for following along.Early coverage of the deal from European papers appears positive.Le Figaro has: “May imposes her Brexit agreement on her team.” Le Monde triumphantly carries May’s assessment of her cabinet success as a “decisive step” and calls it a success. Les Echos paints the weariest picture, referring to the pain May had to go through to get the support of her ministers.In Germany, Die Zeit has “British cabinet accepts May’s Brexit draft”, Der Spiegel says “Theresa May after Brexit-deal: dodged a bullet”, Die Welt leads with “British cabinet agrees to drafted Brexit deal”, Süddeutsche Zeitung has “Brexit deal overcomes important hurdle” and Bild Zeitung “Stage-victory for British premier Theresa May: Cabinet waves through Brexit deal”.Sam Coates, the Times’ deputy political editor, has some juicy tidbits from inside the cabinet meeting today, including Esther McVey’s “meltdown”, which we have also reported on, and this interesting nugget: “Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the room that he could not guarantee people would not die as a result of a no-deal Brexit.” There’s no explanation of what Hancock may have been referring to.Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister of Ireland, has tweeted his thanks to those involved in securing the draft agreement, which he calls “a credible Brexit withdrawal agreement that protects Ireland, our shared island and our future relationship with the UK”.The Irish leaders have been among the only ones to speak positively about the deal.We had some quotes from Nicola Sturgeon earlier in the day, but here is her full statement, in which she labels the deal “bad for Scotland” and said it was like being “blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire”.In a phone call with the Prime Minister after the Cabinet meeting, Ms Sturgeon rejected Mrs May’s assertion that Scotland’s interests had been protected in the deal. I pointed out that there isn’t a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage,” she said. It is obvious that the Prime Minister can barely unite her Cabinet on this deal and it is also increasingly clear that she will struggle to get a majority for it in Parliament. In these circumstances it is more important than ever that we are not faced with a false choice between a bad deal and no deal. No-one should be effectively blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire. This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards. If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament, then the UK Government must return to the negotiating table to secure a better one. Our bottom line - short of continued EU membership - is continued, permanent membership of the single market and customs union.This is a bad deal for the country. Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy - one that guarantees standards and protections. The Tories have let down the country with their bungled negotiations and pushed Britain towards a bad deal that will harm jobs, rights and living standards. The deal undermines the integrity of the UK and would be another example of the Tories playing into the hands of the SNP by putting the future of the UK at risk through their ineptitude and recklessness. Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign if the integrity of the UK was put at risk - and it appears Theresa May has simply ignored them.Ukip are making hay out of today’s news and are pushing membership of their party in light of the draft agreement, which they describe as “May’s abject surrender”.The ads also have strong military tone. One features a picture depicting May as Neville Chamberlain holding up his infamous “peace for our time” paper and urges people to “join the fight back”.Another, from a Twitter account called War Plan Purple, which is an official Ukip account, urges people to “ENLIST”.Prison minister Rory Stewart has said European Union member states believe Theresa May’s Brexit deal is “too good” for Britain, claiming it reflects what “many EU countries want” – benefits of customs union membership with no freedom of movement.Speaking on the BBC earlier today, Stewart told Andrew Neill: “From their point of view, this sounds like Norway with control over borders, which is what a lot of European states would want.“Because from their point of view, from many people in Europe, they feel this is exactly what many European states want. Which is control over immigration and unfettered access to the single market on goods.“And they believe that these four freedoms are inalienable and would say this is breaking the four freedoms.”Neil accused Stewart of “making up half a dozen things”, saying: “The customs union is not related to free movement. The single market is different from the customs union. That is related to free movement.”And this is what the chief whip said when he left the office earlier.’s Dan Sabbagh has been keeping an eye on who has been going in and out of the PM’s office in Westminster this evening. Iain Dale, LBC presenter and staunch Brexiter, caused a stir earlier tonight when he told Newsnight that he’d rather Britain remain in the EU than leave the union with this deal. He has published a blog explaining those comments (and says, for the record, that he’d prefer no deal over either remaining or taking this deal). In his blogpost, he describes the agreement reached with the EU by May as a “constitutional outrage” that “reduces Britain – which is still the 5th or 6th largest economy in the world – to the state of an EU controlled province.”This is not what I voted for on June 23 2016. I am pretty sure it’s not what 17.4 million other people voted for. We now have the worst of all worlds, a Brexit In Name Only - commonly known as BRINO. Not in Europe, but still run by Europe, as William Hague might not have said...I’m often asked if I regret my Leave vote. I most certainly do not. The reasons why I voted Leave are as valid today as they were two and a half years ago. There is no one to blame for the fact that the negotiations have ended up in this sorry way except for those who have been conducting them...I regard this deal as so damaging to our country both in the short and long term that if I had to make a choice between voting for this deal or remaining in the European Union, I’d do the latter.Jacob Rees Mogg was on Peston, where he vented about the deal. Here’s a clip.When I first heard about the document, obviously it was gossip and it was rumour and it was leaks. Now that the document is available, unfortunately it’s worse than the gossip and the rumour and the leaks. And it fails the prime minister’s own promises, and that’s the most concerning thing, because a prime minister must not promise one thing and do another.And some more of today’s front pages. None are as colourful as the Sun’s, but the consensus of seems to be that while May may be holding on, it is by the skin of her teeth.Hello late-night politics-watchers, this is Kate Lyons taking over the blog from Ruth Quinn. Hats off to all my colleagues who have brought you the news as it has unfolded. What a day!There’s a lot of unhappiness around tonight about the deal, including from the Sun, who blast it on Thursday’s front page. Here’s their front page (right) and their front page on the day after the referendum during happier times (for the Sun, that is).The Independent’s political correspondent Benjamin Kentish reports that No 10 are allow a vote on amendments before main vote in parliament Ominous tweet from Arlene Foster.

Its aim was to bounce other ministers into agreement with the prime minister’s deal. The ministers didn’t get the chance to read the agreement fully. They were given inidual briefings that flattered their self-importance. If the strategy succeeded – and most ministers bought in – it meant the Brexit deal would reach first base in the long process of ratification. It would also have momentum, making it harder to defeat. No 10 has shown some emotional intelligence this week alongside the political ruthlessness...Meanwhile, Westminster’s second important meeting was going ahead under the radar. MPs have long been promised a “meaningful vote” on the package that May secured this week. Wednesday’s meeting of the Commons procedure committee will have done much to shape how that will work. At issue is whether parliament will have the tools and the will to take control of the Brexit decision and reshape it in the way the parliamentary numbers suggest is possible and that so many in and beyond Westminster want and expect it to do...That question is whether, in its meaningful vote, parliament has the muscle to do anything more than approve or reject May’s deal. If May had a working majority, the answer would be pretty obvious – approval. But she doesn’t have a majority, so the outcome isn’t obvious, and the scope of the procedure to be followed is therefore crucial for the many who oppose May’s deal and no-deal alike.Labour MPs have launched a petition calling on Jeremy Corbyn to back a people’s vote on whether Brexit should continue.The petition was launched by Angela Smith, Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbrige, and has been shared by Chuka Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham.Brexit in any form poses real harm to our country’s future. And with new dangers coming to light every day, we believe that MPs should give the public the final say, which must include an option to remain in the European Union.We call on Labour’s Leader Jeremy Corbyn to back a People’s Vote on Brexit at the earliest opportunity -- and if he is successful in forcing a General Election then Labour’s manifesto must commit clearly to an immediate People’s Vote, in which Labour will campaign to remain.Starmer is being pushed on whether Labour will refuse to back the deal. He says Labour always said it would read and assess the deal against its “six tests”.“It’s failing all six of them,” he says. “We’ve always said we’re not prepared to back a bad deal, and why would you, it doesn’t meet our tests, it doesn’t tell you where you’re going.”Starmer says May’s line that the choice is between this deal or no deal is a “threat” from the prime minister and he says that Labour does not accept this ultimatum. Many MPs, not just Labour MPs, will refuse to accept that they must agree to a deal they think is bad, out of fear of preventing something worse (a no-deal Brexit), says Starmer.“There is an alternative,” he says, which is a deal that involves a comprehensive customs union and the UK staying in the single market.Starmer says there isn’t much firm detail about the future relationship between the UK and the EU.“What it means is we haven’t negotiated anything about the future relationship that is serious enough to be committed to paper... Give us enough detail to know where we’re headingPutting detail aside, even the ambition isn’t clear, says Starmer. “It doesn’t even have the ambition anymore of frictionless trade... This must be the first proposed trade deal that makes trade more difficult, rather than easier.”Keir Starmer, shadow Brexit story is speaking to BBC 5Live now and he’s coming out all guns blazing.“We’ve read and analysed all 585 pages, it’s a miserable failure of negotiation.”He says there are pages and pages of detail about the backstop “which the government says it doesn’t intend to use.”“But for the future relationship, what it does intend, it’s seven pages, it’s vague in the extreme. And only three pages on the economic agreement.”“We talk about blind Brexit. This about the blindest of blind agreements. This is much vaguer than a lot of the speeches the prime minister has given.”Kevin Connelly, the BBC’s European correspondent has just been on BBC 5Live, and has been talking about the 585-page draft agreement, which ministers voted on yesterday in that long cabinet meeting.“It’s like being given a Victorian novel and being given two hours to read it and then being asked what you think of inidual characters and how you think the plot works. “Or when you take an update from iTunes and you’re given 35 pages of very dense language, and it’s 20 times that and written in similar language.”Some of the online headlines from Dutch news outlets feature Brexit today. (Do get in touch if your Dutch translation is better than Google Translate’s – as it inevitably will be if you actually speak Dutch.)Algemeen Dagblad or AD, says: “Brexiteers critical: we pay billions get nothing back”, Daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad says “British cabinet does not unanimously agree with Brexitdeal”. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is doing the rounds this morning to set out the Labour reaction to the Brexit deal. I’ll be listening and will bring you a summary of what he’s saying.Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, is on the Today show at the moment and was on the phone call with the chancellor last night.She says business leaders were relieved that the wording of the draft avoids a “cliff edge” for the UK.She said the deal “was not perfect” and if there was any disappointment for the business community, it was that there was not as much certainty around achieving frictionless trade as they would have liked.“This gives a potential route forward. We can’t underestimate the benefits of coming back from the cliff edge for communities and businesses, but there’s a hard slog ahead.”A commenter has pointed out an omission in my previous post that analysed the numbers May might need to get the deal through parliament. As they noted, there was no mention of SNP. I apologise for that.It seems unlikely that SNP MPs will support the deal, given Nicola Sturgeon’s comments yesterday. Last night she labelled the deal “bad for Scotland” and said it was like being “blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire”.Sturgeon said that in a phone call with May, she rejected the prime minister’s assertion that Scotland’s interests had been protected in the deal.I pointed out that there isn’t a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage,” she said.It is obvious that the Prime Minister can barely unite her Cabinet on this deal and it is also increasingly clear that she will struggle to get a majority for it in Parliament.In these circumstances it is more important than ever that we are not faced with a false choice between a bad deal and no deal.No-one should be effectively blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire.This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards.If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament, then the UK Government must return to the negotiating table to secure a better one.Our bottom line - short of continued EU membership - is continued, permanent membership of the single market and customs union.If you’re tempted to read the draft withdrawal agreement in full – all 585 pages of it – you can do so here. One of the chief obstacles ahead for May if she is going to get her Brexit agreement through could be the House of Commons, where a simple majority of MPs will need to vote for the blueprint for the deal to be given the green light. The magic number is 320, a majority of the 639 voting MPs in the Commons which excludes suspensions, the Speaker, three Deputy Speakers and seven Sinn Fein MPs who abstain from attending the UK Parliament. The Parliament website lists 93 MPs who are ministers and would therefore be bound to support Theresa May’s Brexit plans owing to collective responsibility. There are others, such as loyalists to May and the government, who are expected to vote in favour of the deal, along with Brexiteer MPs who may have been spooked by the PM’s message that it was this deal, no deal or no Brexit.On the other side of the debate, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru have said they are opposed to a deal so this adds 17 to the noes. The Democratic Unionist Party’s stance on the Brexit deal is uncertain. Arlene Foster has said the Prime Minister is “fully aware of our position and concerns” over Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK. There is ision within the Conservative party too, with the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, claiming it has 80 MPs ready to vote against what it sees as May’s capitulation to Brussels. Opponents suggest the number would be whittled down under a concerted offensive of arm-bending by the Tory whips, so it may finally be considerably less.This means May could need to find up to 100 votes – but perhaps more realistically somewhat less – from elsewhere. So the prime minister may well need to extend an olive branch to Labour, which also has its own isions. The question is how many of Jeremy Corbyn’s MPs are prepared to defy him and support the Prime Minister, reasoning that a no-deal Brexit, which they fear could bring about an economic disaster, would be a worse outcome.The front pages of the newspapers today are fairly varied, but the overwhelming majority are united in casting doubt on the prospects of the deal and the prime minister herself.We’ve got a full wrap of how the papers (including some from Ireland, France and Germany) covered the day’s Brexit news. But I’ve included a few for you below, including :Here’s the Sun, which wins for most punny (playing to their strengths) and is up there for most cranky.The Daily Mail wins the prize for the newspaper that seems to feel most chipper about the day’s events. The  also takes a stoic line, though don’t be fooled by the headline, they raise the prospect of a leadership challenge in the intro, and also give plenty of space to criticisms of the deal by Nick Timothy, the prime minister’s former chief of staff.And, while they’re not a daily paper, and are obviously not going to be in favour of Brexit, The New European wins my award for most visually-striking front page, which carries the headline “May’s last gasp deal”.Good morning and welcome to Politics live for today – the morning after the night before.Yesterday, Theresa May held a five-hour cabinet meeting to discuss the draft of the withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated with the EU. She emerged somewhat victorious, announcing they had reached a “collective” decision to press ahead with finalising the deal in Brussels but it was clear there had been significant dissent.There are some key questions today, including whether any cabinet ministers will resign – reports say Esther McVey is on “resignation watch” – and whether the agreement will get the required support in parliament. May is due to speak to the House of Commons later today, and we’ll obviously be bringing you news of that as it happens.I’m here to kick things off, before my esteemed colleagues take things over later in the morning. As usual, get in touch via the comments or on Twitter, I’m on @mskatelyons.Thanks for reading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f756c4a4d5040c7f47766576ede694c962c7b4/84_0_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2285b27a5fd36c2d2042da1664baa77","title":"impact crater 19 miles wide found beneath greenland glacier","story":"Crater appears to be result of mile-wide iron meteorite just 12,000 years agoThe enormous bowl-shaped dent appears to be the result of a mile-wide iron meteorite slamming into the island at a speed of 12 miles per second as recently as 12,000 years ago.The impact of the 10bn-tonne space rock would have unleashed 47m times the energy of the Little Boy nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. It would have melted vast amounts of ice, sending freshwater rushing into the oceans, and blasted rocky debris high into the atmosphere.At 19.3 miles wide, the crater ranks among the 25 largest known on Earth and is the first to be found beneath an ice sheet.“You have to go back 40 million years to find a crater of the same size, so this is a rare, rare occurrence in Earth’s history,” said Kurt Kjær, of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.Scientists first suspected a crater in 2015 when they spotted a huge depression in Nasa radar images of the bedrock beneath the Hiawatha glacier in north-west Greenland. Kjær, who passes a 20-tonne meteorite to reach his office every day, wondered if such a space rock might be the culprit. “It all snowballed from there,” said Joseph MacGregor, a senior scientist on the team at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.It so happened that researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany were about to test a powerful new ice-penetrating radar system that was operated from the air. In May 2016 the scientists flew over the Hiawatha glacier and used the radar to map the underlying rock in unparalleled detail.The images revealed all the hallmarks of an impact crater. “It became very clear that this was a circular feature with a rim around it and an elevated central region,” said Kjær. The basin itself was more than 300 metres deep, according to a report in the journal Science Advances.To search for solid proof of an impact, the researchers flew out to the glacier and collected sediments that had washed from the crater on to a nearby floodplain. Among the gathered grains, the scientists found particles of shocked quartz and other materials that are typically produced by the violence of a extraterrestrial impact. Geochemical tests of the grains suggest the meteorite was made of iron.So far it has been impossible to put a firm age on the crater, but its condition suggests it formed after ice began to cover Greenland about 3 million years ago. But the crater may have formed much more recently. The radar images show that while the surface layers of the glacier immediately above the crater look normal, deeper layers that are older than 12,000 years are badly deformed and strewn with rocks, with some lumps as big as trucks.“When it happened is the $64,000 question,” said MacGregor. For a final answer, the researchers will need to drill through half a mile of ice and collect crater material for dating, or wait for rocks from the impact basin to be brought to the surface as the glacier flows to the sea. Either way, the scientists have a wait on their hands.“We live on a planet where you can survey anything and you think you know everything,” said Kjær. “But when you see such a big thing as this hiding in plain sight, you realise that the age of discovery is not over yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58a8d0d003b6483be15015dea26bba5cc0623a76/98_0_4432_2660/master/4432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76b4ad39292d8e1f37364e5d9b53f8e","title":"sri lanka v england second test day two live","story":"51st over: Sri Lanka 156-5 (Mathews 16, Roshen 1) Nice stuff here from Rashid, who’s getting some serious turn at times.50th over: Sri Lanka 155-5 (Mathews 15, Roshen 1) Mathews defends, and then takes a single from the last. I’d be wary of predicting imminent collapses: this has been a pretty steady innings from Sri Lanka, and those predicting wild wicket binges before the start of play were I think underestimating them a bit. 49th over: Sri Lanka 154-5 (Mathews 14, Roshen 1) No great consistency from Rashid, but he’s making up for it with occasional beauties, one of which befuddles Mathews here.48th over: Sri Lanka 151-5 (Mathews 12, Roshen 0) Mathews hits high over mid-off, completely safe but unexpectedly extravagant, for four.47th over: Sri Lanka 146-5 (Mathews 7, Roshen 0) A wicket maiden from Rashid. He probably needed some encouragement and now he’s had some. “I’ve been watching this game closely for 45 years and the more I watch, the less I understand,” says Gary Naylor. “I’d have bowled anyone ahead of Rashid to start the session, but, well, there you are. What a game is Test Cricket!”And Rashid makes the breakthrough! The first delivery of his over is a beauty, heading towards leg stump before spinning away and just missing off! Then the next entices Dhananjaya to prod his bat forwards, and it just caresses the edge of his bat on the way through!46th over: Sri Lanka 146-5 (Mathews 7, Roshen 0) Leach has bowled as many overs as Anderson, Rashid, Stokes and Curran combined. One run from this one.45th over: Sri Lanka 145-4 (Dhananjaya 58, Mathews 7) Rashid starts the afternoon session, and finds some sharp turn to send the ball zinging past Dhananjaya. By then, though, Mathews had already plundered five runs.The players are back out and ready for action!An email! “I’m disappointed to announce I’ve examined the Elton John John Lewis Xmas video thoroughly and can find no reference at all to Sam Curran’s cricketing prowess,” rages Kim Thonger. “A terrible omission. I shall be shopping elsewhere this festive season.” I haven’t seen it yet, but am certain it will meet all my festive sentimentality needs.Sri Lanka trail England by 146 runs with six first-innings wickets remainingThat was a fine session of Test cricket. Sri Lanka controlled almost all of it, but England leave the field the happier after Ben Stokes brilliantly turned the tide towards its end. I’ll be back in a bit.44th over: Sri Lanka 139-4 (Dhananjaya 57, Mathews 2) Leach can’t quite create another opening, and that’s the morning done.43rd over: Sri Lanka 138-4 (Dhananjaya 57, Mathews 1) A quick over from Rashid, just about quick enough to allow one more before lunch. He gets some sharp turn, particularly with his final delivery, and Sri Lanka score just a couple, bringing his economy rate down to a reasonable five (the next most expensive bowler, of those who have bowled more than a single over, is Moeen, going at 3.09) 42nd over: Sri Lanka 136-4 (Dhananjaya 56, Mathews 0) After an excellent opening 90 minutes for Sri Lanka, Ben Stokes has turned this session on its head with two acts of bravura, virtuoso fieldsmanship. Just brilliant. There’s the faintest sniff of another wicket too, but Mathews’ edge lands a foot short of Stokes this time.Stokes does it again, taking a brilliant one-handed catch at slip! It’s the gentlest tickle of an edge off Mendis’s bat, Stokes throws out his left palm and it sticks!41st over: Sri Lanka 136-3 (Dhananjaya 56, Mendis 1) Stokes, having created England’s one moment of genius and inspiration today, and with the whiff of luncheon floating towards his nostrils, starts a short spell. He bowls short to Dhananjaya, who pulls away for four to bring up his half-century, from 79 balls, and the same batsman slaps the last ball of the over past mid-on for four more!40th over: Sri Lanka 127-3 (Dhananjaya 48, Mendis 0) Leach instantly returns, starts with a beauty at De Silva and keeps up the pressure from there. Maiden.39th over: Sri Lanka 127-3 (Dhananjaya 48, Mendis 0) Anderson continues his search for swing, but while he does so a leg-cutter finds De Silva’s edge! The ball flies well wide of the solitary slip, though, and away for four. A couple of balls later, the last of the over, Stokes conjures a breakthrough and England are back in the hunt!That’s phenomenal fielding from Stokes, who collects the ball on the run and sends it towards the stumps in an instant, and with only one to aim at it’s a direct hit and Karunaratne’s gone!38th over: Sri Lanka 123-2 (Karunaratne 63, Dhananjaya 44) Moeen keeps going. One run off the over.37th over: Sri Lanka 122-2 (Karunaratne 63, Dhananjaya 43) Karunaratne drives Anderson to the long-off boundary, a very handsome shot, but then the last ball of the over is slanted across the left-hander, who pushes out his bat. He’s nowhere near the ball, but he lost control momentarily there.36th over: Sri Lanka 117-2 (Karunaratne 59, Dhananjaya 42) Root has had enough of bowling, and Moeen returns.35th over: Sri Lanka 112-2 (Karunaratne 58, Dhananjaya 38) England have had a couple of half-chances and not-quites this morning, but the batsmen have taken few risks, made good decisions, and scored runs when they’ve been available. It has been precisely the required approach. Another over from Anderson, who gets little encouragement from pitch or ball.34th over: Sri Lanka 110-2 (Karunaratne 56, Dhananjaya 38) Root takes his sunglasses off his cap, takes off his cap, sends down six deliveries, redons his cap, and places the sunglasses back atop it. His cap doesn’t really need sunglasses. He could save a bit of time and effort and just leave them at home next time.33rd over: Sri Lanka 108-2 (Karunaratne 55, Dhananjaya 37) Given today’s heat (well, the people experiencing it tell me it’s hot) England are unlikely to eke any lengthy spells out of their pacemen. But they need to get these two batsmen out of their comfort zone, and ideally just get them out. No joy just yet.32nd over: Sri Lanka 106-2 (Karunaratne 53, Dhananjaya 37) “In a parallel universe, Monty has 350 Test wickets, but, alas, not in ours (I’ve been watching The Man in the High Castle),” writs Gary Naylor. “That said, Jack Leach shows every sign of gathering some of those for himself. Impressive.” I think both Leach and Moeen have been OK today, albeit without conjuring any periods of extended pressure, but Rashid has had a little less control. Root has now decided to try something different, and Anderson is about to do his first significant work of the day.31st over: Sri Lanka 105-2 (Karunaratne 52, Dhananjaya 37) Rashid keeps going, as indeed do both batsmen.30th over: Sri Lanka 101-2 (Karunaratne 51, Dhananjaya 34) It has, so far, not been the morning that England were hoping for. The captain decides to have a bowl himself, and gives us a glimpse of his legspin, but it’s easily dealt with.29th over: Sri Lanka 97-2 (Karunaratne 50, Dhananjaya 32) Karunaratne reverse-sweeps fine for four, and then again for the single that brings up his 50. At which point, the players adjourn briefly for drinks.28th over: Sri Lanka 90-2 (Karunaratne 43, Dhananjaya 32) Leach bowls one full and straight, tempts Dhananjaya to push forward, and then turns it past the bat. Nice delivery, and he’s been a bit unlucky not to get some reward for his first hour’s work.27th over: Sri Lanka 87-2 (Karunaratne 42, Dhananjaya 30) Karunaratne miscues his shot into the air towards midwicket, but it lands completely safe. Next ball is pulled away for four by Dhananjaya, and then the one after that snorts between bat and pad and misses the stumps by this much. Action-packed, that was.26th over: Sri Lanka 80-2 (Karunaratne 40, Dhananjaya 26) Leach continues, and Karunaratne clips the ball straight to short leg, but it comes to him - as it tends to given how far away he’s standing - quickly, and he can’t get his hand (either of them) into position in time to catch it. 25th over: Sri Lanka 78-2 (Karunaratne 39, Dhananjaya 25) England’s first bowling change of the day gives Rashid something else to do. He gets plenty of turn but his length is inconsistent and he presents a few easy scoring chances. 24th over: Sri Lanka 72-2 (Karunaratne 35, Dhananjaya 23) Karunaratne reverse-sweeps for a couple, Rashid - who seems to have been the man forlornly chasing after every decent shot the batsmen hit at the moment - getting to it just before the rope this time. He then reverse-sweeps the next as well, but straight to the fielder this time.23rd over: Sri Lanka 68-2 (Karunaratne 32, Dhananjaya 22) Moeen bowls, and De Silva cracks the ball down the ground for four! Fine shot, that. He’s rollicking along here, his 22 coming off 29 balls.22nd over: Sri Lanka 60-2 (Karunaratne 31, Dhananjaya 15) More big turn here for Leach, who convinces the ball to spin past the bat twice as Dhananjaya pushes forward to consecutive deliveries.21st over: Sri Lanka 56-2 (Karunaratne 30, Dhananjaya 12) And four more! De Silva drives the first ball of Moeen’s over past mid-off. The over ends much more encouragingly, with a ripping, turning humdinger that zips past a bewildered Karunaratne.20th over: Sri Lanka 51-2 (Karunaratne 30, Dhananjaya 7) A couple of balls into the over Stokes, the solitary slip, motions to the dressing-room demanding a helmet. Though when the ball isn’t carrying as far as his foot, his head would appear to be in little danger. When it arrives, though, Jos Buttler puts it on and settles in at leg slip. “I fielded there for 20 years and never got hit,” sniffs David Lloyd. Karunaratne cuts the last ball fine for four.19th over: Sri Lanka 46-2 (Karunaratne 26, Dhananjaya 6) Moeen doesn’t continue the drip of near-misses, but he also only concedes one run.18th over: Sri Lanka 45-2 (Karunaratne 26, Dhananjaya 5) Oooof! Leach finds De Silva’s edge but the ball doesn’t carry to Stokes at slip, who collects it on the bounce with a regretful shake of the head. The Karunaratne edges the last, but this one doesn’t make it to leg slip!17th over: Sri Lanka 43-2 (Karunaratne 25, Dhananjaya 4) A nice sweep from Karunaratne yields a couple, and then he cuts the next for a single to stay on strike. 16th over: Sri Lanka 39-2 (Karunaratne 22, Dhananjaya 3) The ball spins past advancing batsman and keeper and trundles away for four byes, the first byes ever conceded by Foakes in Test cricket.15th over: Sri Lanka 32-2 (Karunaratne 21, Dhananjaya 1) The nightwatchman blundered straight into a fairly obvious trap there. Here are some opinions:Pushpakumara attempts a slog sweep, doesn’t get hold of it and the ball loops limply into the hands of Burns at midwicket!14th over: Sri Lanka 29-1 (Karunaratne 21, Pushpakumara 2) Leach bowls, and Pushpakumara edges, the ball flying wide of slip. It’s the start of an action-packed over, also featuring the failed lbw appeal and a last-ball quarter-chance for Jennings at short leg, the ball arriving just a little too low for a catch to be practical.The ball turned a little too much before hitting the pad, and would have missed leg stump by an inch. England appealed long and loud, but the umpire was unmoved. Root doesn’t take long to call for the review.13th over: Sri Lanka 27-1 (Karunaratne 20, Pushpakumara 1) Cowabunga! The first ball of the day is an absolute ripper from Moeen! It rips past Karunaratne, and is a fine start to a very decent first over of the day. One off it.The players are out, and Moeen Ali appears to be warming up with particular enthusiasm. Action imminent!Today in Kandy: hot and sunny. A repeat is not forecast in the next few days, when rain is expected (though as we saw in Galle, weather forecasting is not a Sri Lankan strength).Hello world! Well then. Day two, and today we will discover just how decent England’s first-innings total of 285 was. What we already know about that total is this: it’s lot more decent than it would have been had Sam Curran not been there. Here’s a bit of early-morningeveningafternoonwhatever-it-is-where-you-are reading about day one, starting with Vic Marks’ close-of-play report:On a beige surface as dry and crumbly as a forgotten biscuit at the bottom of the tin England, with the considerable benefit of batting first, put some runs on the board – 285 of them. Whether that is enough to control the game we must wait to know for sure but the likelihood is that this is a highly satisfactory total.Much more here:Then continuing with more from Vic, after he grabbed a quick chat with the man of the moment:You can see why they do not leave him out anymore and if he keeps batting like this he will soon be another contender to play at number three. Sam Curran top-scored for England – by one run – and yet again played a key role in bolstering a total alongside the tail.This was his third half-century for England and he has reached every one of them with a six, a unique feat. He is no man mountain, the biceps do not bulge yet he smote six mighty sixes – on one of the world’s larger grounds – in a last wicket partnership of 60 with Jimmy Anderson that Curran himself described as “crucial” as it lifted England to 285. “We’ve got a nice score on the board now,” he said.Much more here:And here’s Tanya Aldred in this week’s Spin on the impact of previous Lions tours on England’s current Test team:As the projected costs of The Hundred mount, tripling from the original estimate of £13m up to £40m – and counting – budgets are being slashed at ECB Towers. Gone is Andrew Strauss’s pet North-South series, gone is the not-so-mourned Pace Programme, gone are the Overseas Placements that so benefited Ollie Pope and Mason Crane in consecutive winters in Sydney. But still hanging on, whether by thread or rope, is the Lions Programme, perhaps English cricket’s most secret and deadly weapon. Much more here:Anyway, and most importantly, welcome. Let’s enjoy some cricket together, shall we? Oh, and also: send me funny emails.

Her target was the wealthy western consumer travelling to the Caribbean island of her birth but she also took in former British colonial rule and corruption inside the Antiguan government.This staging of Kincaid’s book is so faithful an adaptation that it performs the text in its original and entire form, spoken to the audience with no dialogue between actors. Director Anna Himali Howard underlines, rather than hides, the fact: the opening scene features an unnamed actor (Cherrelle Skeete) reading from the essay by torchlight. She puts the book away when a second actor (Nicola Alexis) joins her, but they narrate every word of the essay together.Some of the best, most barbed parts satirise the spoiled tourists, who, like the sun-burned Americans travelling to Haiti in Roxane Gay’s short story collection, Ayiti, turn a blind eye to the realities of islander life and suck up the five-star luxury: “You emerge from customs into the hot, clean air: immediately you feel cleansed … When you sit down to eat your delicious meal, it’s better that you don’t know that most of what you are eating came off a plane from Miami.”What might have felt like a lecture is animated by the actors’ delivery, which bring out the script’s spiked humour and its eloquent rage. Skeete speaks with a fierce energy and occasional impishness, while Alexis projects controlled anger.Camilla Clarke’s set is designed as a travel centre or waiting room, incorporating – and implicating – the audience as the tourists to whom Kincaid’s diatribe is addressed.Seating is ided into several sections with props strewn in between – hotel room TV sets, an office cabinet and footstool, clocks showing different time zones, a glass display of a museum bust and a mobile shelving unit for books that symbolises the island’s battered library.It is all inventively done, with glints of humour (at one point, Skeete’s head appears inside the museum’s display cabinet, as if to suggest that the “exotic” indigenous islander has become part of the tourist’s experience). But the back-to-back seating arrangements for the audience and the lack of a focal point are occasionally discombobulating.Johanne Jensen’s lighting dips occasionally to total darkness, until a lamp or a torch is suddenly switched on. It is atmospheric and hints at electricity blackouts for local islanders, though this is never spelled out.The actors switch on an overhead projector and encourage us to imagine on its blank screen the scenes they describe. These include air-conditioned hotel rooms and perfect sea views alongside the island’s grubbier side – the library in disrepair since an earthquake, the broken hospital system and the exclusive members of the Mill Reef Club, where the only local, non-white faces are those of waiting staff.Skeete and Alexis are almost constantly moving, but the circling and weaving comes to seem churning and repetitive. They walk around the audience, turn on lamps, stand behind a desk, carry books. Where the intention might have been to avoid a static performance, the physical drama could have gained power and coherence from more moments of stillness.A Small Place is bold and enlivening polemical theatre nonetheless, and it is passionately performed, with political resonances around race, colonial legacy and blind consumerism that run deep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

Within a month, she gained more than 30,000 followers, and for obvious reasons: She’s hilarious and captivating and consistently manages to not fall off the side of a mountain in those 6in heels. (If there isn’t already a Boy Scout badge for that achievement, there should be.) In one video, the 6ft10in Pattie twirls her trekking poles on top of a mountain to Fergie’s London Bridge. (Fergie has seen the video.) In another, geotagged at Brokeback Mountain, she gets sexy in a cowboy getup in front of some unenthused horses. For Halloween, she hiked in full drag as Mother Nature. The self-proclaimed “world’s first backpacking queen” is officially here.The character – whose name is a pun on the California-based gear brand, though she has no sponsorship or formal connection to it – is portrayed by the Nebraska-based photographer and Eagle Scout Wyn Wiley. Earlier this year, he and his friends were brainstorming drag names, and a friend tossed out the name Pattie Gonia. An avid skier, thru-hiker, and rock climber, Wiley thought the idea was too fun to pass up. His upcoming trip to the Continental Divide would be Pattie’s grand debut. He had once done a drag performance as Ginger Snap (he’s a red-headed photographer – get it?) and still had the boots, so he dug them up. “I just packed in the boots and was like, ‘This does not make sense at all. I have no room in my pack for these.’” Wiley doesn’t do entire hikes in Pattie’s boots, as the human ankle was not created for such a feat, but he always treks a portion in them.So how did Pattie blow up so quickly? Wiley boasts more than 75,000 followers on his personal account – he’s a professional wedding and portrait photographer and videographer when he’s not climbing mountains in heels – which gave Pattie a solid platform from the get-go. But Wiley attributes her popularity to something a little more magical than Instagram analytics. “There’s a queen inside everyone,” he says. “I think Pattie is the voice inside telling people they should just go for it. Live unapologetically.”Drag culture is as mainstream as it has ever been: RuPaul is now an Emmy-winning household name, and his ubiquity is only trumped by that of drag slang. Wiley cites Pattie’s unconventional look – her being in nature and mixing up feminine and masculine attire – as a point of interest. “I think if I just walked on to the scene as Pattie as just a classic drag queen, I don’t think it would have as much engagement,” Wiley surmises.Wiley posted that first Pattie Gonia video to his personal account with the intention of it being a one-time thing. But given the enthusiastic response, he decided to build out the character, if for no other reason than to make people laugh. “Pattie Gonia is fun, first and foremost,” Wiley says. “I feel like social media sucks so much life out of us. If we can have a place where people can have a good laugh or be encouraged, I think I want her to be there.”Beyond that, Wiley’s ultimate goal is for Pattie Gonia to inspire more people to spend time outdoors, particularly those who have historically been excluded from the outdoor community, including the LGBTQ community, people of color, and fat folks. Wiley hopes to achieve that goal by leading groups of novice hikers as Pattie Gonia, getting sponsors to provide gear for those who can’t afford it, and amplifying the work of others who have been campaigning for inclusiveness in the outdoor community for years. He particularly admires the work of Jenny Bruso, founder of Unlikely Hikers, a Portland-based group that leads hikes for underrepresented outdoorists.On a more personal level, drag is a way for Wiley to explore his more feminine sides. “In my normal life, I’d say I’m pretty straight-passing,” he says. “But when I put those boots on, it feels like a girl when she puts on mascara for the first time – it unlocks a different side of you that you haven’t seen before. I think femme is important. I think masculinity is important. I think it’s all inside of us.”For Wiley, nature also contains both a femininity and a masculinity. Outdoorsiness often has a butch connotation – roughing it and rolling around in the mud isn’t stereotypically girly. (Of course, the act of enjoying the outdoors has no gender, but living in a patriarchal society means unwittingly assigning gender roles to all sorts of inanimate things.) As Pattie, Wiley aims to buck that cliche by shining a light on the femininity that he believes has always existed in the outdoor world. “I just got into rock climbing this year, and you can masculine your way up a wall, but there’s no beauty in it,” he says. “The people I look up to at my rock climbing gym who are so graceful about it pull from all the feminine aspects – it’s like watching ballet happen on a wall.”Ultimately, Pattie Gonia is here to unleash the hiker, skier, and rock climber in everyone, regardless of gender. “It takes a freakin’ boss-ass bitch to climb a mountain, no matter whoever you are,” Wiley says. “Girl, guy, no matter where you are on the spectrum, it’s awesome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2681aed65968dea793f68990a1141e90fcf9f580/0_537_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cda6dcc6ec58d3f34a957be439af03b","title":"woman on trial over child found in squalid car boot in france","story":"Partner and sister of accused say they had no idea she had given birth to fourth childRelatives of a woman who hid her baby in the maggot-infested boot of a car have said they had no idea of her secret, during a trial that has drawn horror in France.Rosa-Maria Da Cruz, 50, is accused of keeping her daughter Séréna hidden away until she was nearly two, leaving her with serious learning disabilities.Séréna was discovered in 2013 in the filthy boot of a Peugeot 307 and had also been kept in an unused room at the family home in the Corrèze region of central France.It was a mechanic who found her in the boot after Da Cruz, who is originally from Portugal, had taken the car to be repaired. Hearing a noise, he opened the boot to discover the baby in a car seat, naked, filthy and dehydrated. She was surrounded by maggots and excrement.The trial, which opened on Monday, has heard testimony from relatives about how Da Cruz was, to all appearances, a model mother to her three other children.Her partner, Domingos Sampaio Alves, has said he had no idea she had given birth to another child and she had kept it a secret. By way of explanation, he said he went only about once a month to the small ground-floor room, under renovation, where Da Cruz kept the baby much of the time. He also did not visit the car often as he does not have a driving licence.“I don’t know why she did this,” he told the court in Portuguese through a translator.The unemployed bricklayer was originally charged, but investigators concluded there was no reason to doubt his account. Da Cruz was released pending trial, and the couple have stayed together. “I continue to live with her because she is a good mother to the children,” Alves told the court.They have kept their three older children – aged nine, 14 and 15 – but authorities have refused to let them have contact with Serena, who is now aged seven and living with foster parents.In her opening testimony on Monday, Da Cruz fought back tears and told the court: “It’s very hard to be confronted with reality, with the damage I have done.”Séréna now suffers from severe mental impairments including irreversible autism, which medical experts have linked to sensory deprivation during her early months.A paediatrician who examined Séréna and her siblings after the discovery said her team had been “stupefied” by “the gulf between Séréna’s situation and those of her brothers and sisters”, who appeared to have been “perfectly raised”.“You could see she had been a good mother, and we could not understand why Séréna had not received the same quality of care at home,” the doctor said.The judge Gilles Fonrouge said that while the child was now in good physical health, she was “closed off to interactions around her”.Marie-Pierre Peis-Hitier, a lawyer for the social services, said the child could say only a handful of words, and it had taken a full afternoon to win the child’s trust.Da Cruz’s sister and nieces also said they had no idea of Séréna’s existence, and said Da Cruz was a “loving” mother to the other children.“Inside I think she is suffering. She knows what she has done,” her niece Elodie told the court.The court heard that Da Cruz had initially hidden the pregnancies of two of her other children from her partner, not wanting to face reality.Da Cruz is charged with violence against a minor and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The trial continues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77e59d3d079372d014058426e1d91780ceb9fd1/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd618ca04ebaccc43470633d47919861","title":"rohingya refugee repatriations bangladesh myanmar","story":"Bangladesh has said repatriations will be ‘totally voluntary’ but no refugees spoken to by the UN were willingConfusion and uncertainty remained on Thursday over whether Bangladesh would begin the scheduled repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar despite overwhelming evidence that none are willing to return voluntarily.Thousands of the Rohingya refugees who had been put on a list “approved” for return to Myanmar- due to start today- have gone into hiding out of fear that, despite assurance by the Bangladesh authorities that repatriation will be “totally voluntary”, the security forces would forcibly send them across the border.By mid-morning on Thursday, the presence of the military and the police remained heavy in the camps but no attempts to repatriate refugees had begun.The few who are reportedly willing to return are 450 Hindu families who are on the list of 2,260 refugees who have been vetted and approved by Myanmar to come back.The UNHCR, who have actively opposed the repatriation plans out of concern that the current conditions in Myanmar do not guarantee the rights and safety of the Rohingya, began a process of interviewing every refugee on the list to determine whether they wanted to return but struggled to find most of them.But by Wednesday night, hours before repatriation was due to begin, the UNHCR had spoken to just 48 families who all said they did not want to return to Myanmar in the current conditions.The Bangladesh refugee commissioner was unavailable for comment on Wednesday night on whether the repatriations would proceed despite the mass resistance.Qadar, who like many Rohingya uses one name, told the  that, from Jamtoli camp alone, several thousand refugees had gone into hiding in the forests and nearby hills since Wednesday evening to make sure they were not sent back to Myanmar against their will.“Almost all the refugees who are in the list have disappeared,” said Qadar, who was among those sheltering in the forest. “Many are saying that in this situation security forces would pick up other Rohingya who are not on the list and push them across the border to meet their repatriation-related targets.“In Myanmar often we the Rohingya men fled our villages and spent nights hiding in forests and hills to avoid arrest by Burmese forces who usually raided at night,” he added. “We never thought that even in Bangladesh we would someday need to stay away in hiding in the forest this way under the open sky.”Fears in the Cox’s Bazar camps, particularly Jamtoli, Unchiprang and Chakmarkul, intensified on Wednesday as the army, police and paramilitary moved in to try and prevent any further Rohingya families going into hiding to avoid repatriation back to Myanmar. Confusion reigned as it was unclear if the repatriations would begin on Thursday, as per the schedule laid out by both the Myanmar and Bangladesh governments.Rohingya refugees told the  of the multiple ways that the Bangladesh authorities were trying to “persuade” refugees to go back, including telling them that it was the only way they would get the Myanmar government to give them rights and citizenship.They also made direct threats. Saifullah, who lives in Balukhali camp, said that the CIC had warned the majhis of “stern actions” if the Rohingya who are in the repatriation list do not return to Myanmar.“The CIC have been telling Rohingya refugees will face hardship if they do not return to Myanmar,” he said. “They are threatening to stop supplying rations to refugees, saying they will be barred from working with the different NGOs and will not have the freedom to move around freely.”The UN has called on both governments to halt the “rushed” repatriation plans but the pleas appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Bangladesh, however, tried to quell the panic by instructing NGOs it maintained its commitment to voluntary returns and that all NGOs should continue their work as usual on Thursday.There are over 700,00o Rohingya refugees living in Cox’s Bazar who fled a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military in August 2017, which was described by the UN fact-finding mission as genocide. The violence saw women raped, children massacred and thousands killed, while most Rohingya villages in Rakhine state were burned to the ground. According to the head of the UN fact-finding mission, the genocide in Rakhine against the muslim minority is “still ongoing” and there were demonstrations this week among Buddhist Rakhine communities who protested against the return of the Rohingya.Myanmar has insisted they are ready for returns and laid the blame for any delays at Bangladesh’s door. Officials have stated that refugees from Cox’s Bazar will be processed in one of the two centres built by Bangladesh and then transported back to Myanmar either by boat or on land to Hla Po Khaung transition camp, in Rakhine state.The Myanmar government have assured the international community the Rohingya will then be housed in new homes built in Maungdaw, one of the three areas the Rohingya had lived before the crackdown, though they will not be allowed to travel outside of the township. Most will also be unable to return to their original homes and villages because they were burned down by the military in the crackdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f205fff58f13d8f7ba9b30664121faa59f3c8ebd/0_152_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=053f1fc80339e95522f0feca82b7e351","title":"thursday briefing may takes draft brexit deal to parliament","story":"PM faces battle to win backing among ided MPs … diesel fumes damaging children’s lungs for life … and do we need the latest Harry Potter spin-off?Good morning – I’m Warren Murray and it all boils down to this.The prime minister today launches a campaign to get her Brexit agreement through parliament, having won the deeply reluctant approval of her cabinet. We are straight into live-blogging what will no doubt be another extraordinary day. Up to 11 ministers are understood to have voiced objections in a five-hour cabinet meeting that got shouty and fraught at times. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, was said to have been the only leaver to speak in favour of the draft deal.May said after the cabinet meeting that she believed “with my head and my heart” that her deal was the best one for the UK – and the only alternatives were no deal, or no Brexit. The Northern Ireland backstop had been a particularly difficult point, she said. And here’s that in a nutshell (albeit the biggest nutshell we could find). If they can’t get a permanent EU-UK trade deal by December 2020, the transition period can be extended. If that doesn’t work, the backstop comes into play: “a single customs territory between the Union and the United Kingdom”, excluding fisheries. The backstop stays in force either until a permanent solution is found, or both sides agree jointly to end it. The backstop might never be invoked, but it sticks sideways in the DUP’s craw because it would have to mean extra non-customs checks on some types of goods passing between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.EU ambassadors held their own lengthy meeting on Wednesday, and Brussels is expected to convene a special summit on 25 November seeking to have the deal signed off – we are hearing suggestions that an announcement will be made this morning. France, Spain and Denmark have all raised concerns with the European commission that the UK is being handed a customs union without sufficiently strong conditions. In comments reported overnight, Rory Stewart, the prisons minister and a remainer, said: “From their point of view, this sounds like Norway with control over borders, which is what a lot of European states would want … control over immigration and unfettered access to the single market on goods. And they believe that these four freedoms are inalienable and would say this is breaking the four freedoms.”The “path is still long” in getting agreement on both sides of the channel, said Michel Barnier, the chief EU negotiator. In parliament, Martin Kettle writes, “the question is whether, in the meaningful vote, MPs have the muscle to do anything more than approve or reject May’s deal”.Arrest over murder of girl – A man has been charged with the murder of schoolgirl Lucy McHugh, 13, whose body was found in woodland at Southampton Sports Centre on 26 July. She had been stabbed to death. Stephen-Alan Nicholson, 24, of no fixed abode, has been charged with murder rape of a child under 13 and two counts of sexual activity with a child under 16, one of which dates back to 2012. He is to appear at Southampton magistrates’ court on Thursday.

In a damning report, the NYT says Mark Zuckerberg’s social network hired Definers Public Affairs. It published negative stories about Facebook’s rivals and critics on NTKNetwork, a faux-news site run by the PR firm, which was founded by Republican operatives. Soros, who was born in Hungary in 1930 and made a fortune as an investor, is a major funder of liberal and pro-democratic causes. “This narrative has really dangerous antisemitic undertones about Jewish people controlling the world,” said Rashad Robinson from the civil rights group Color of Change, which was targeted by the campaign. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.Light-fingered – Researchers have used a neural network to generate fake fingerprints that could be used as a skeleton key to break into biometric security systems. The “DeepMasterPrints” created at New York University could mimic more than one in five fingerprints in a system that should only be wrong once in a thousand. It was possible because fingerprint scanners mostly check only a partial image, and there are many common features to fingerprints. The artificial fingerprints also look normal to the human eye. The researchers compared it to a “dictionary attack” where a hacker runs a list of common passwords against a security system. They may not be able to break into a specific account, but attacking a large number of accounts produces enough successes to make it worth the effort.Wind in their sails – The creator of an omnidirectional windmill have won the £30,000 James Dyson award for invention. The O-Wind turbine created by Lancaster University students Nicolas Orellana and Yaseen Noorani can catch the wind from any direction – without having to change its own orientation – and turn it into electricity.

Harry Potter’s last adventures had hit the bookstores in 2007, and three years later the Warner Bros adaptations had just about run their course in cinemas too. For many millennials, the young wizard had worked his magic through most of their childhood. But it’s 2018 now, and a new Harry Potter extended universe film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, is out this week. … Someone needs to call a halt to the excessive afterlife of Potter’s fictional universe.”Fifa is investigating five Premier League clubs over possible violations of rules on the signing of foreign players under the age of 18 with the quintet risking transfer bans if found guilty.

If you’re sick of Brexit, look away now. The  sums up the scale of ision that reigns, with the headline: “May Brexit plan: a split cabinet, a split party and a split nation” and mentions the 11 dissenting cabinet voices. The  omits Boris Johnson from its front page and uses May’s own words: “There will be difficult days ahead.” It also gives plenty of space to criticisms of the deal by Nick Timothy, the prime minister’s former chief of staff.The Times feels May has “papered over the cracks” and suggests she used the threat of no Brexit at all to force ministers to toe the line. The Mirror also homes in on the ministerial isions with “War cabinet” and claims 40 Tory rebels are plotting to bring her down. The Mail reports on the threat of a “coup within days” but strikes a defiant tone, using an image of May and: “I stand to fight.” The Express paints the rosiest picture for May, with no mention of leadership challenges or cabinet troubles. “It’s my deal … or no Brexit” is the headline. The FT plays it straight, saying May has won a “ferocious debate” and now faces a fresh battle in parliament. The Sun has its fun with “We’re in the Brexs*it” (their asterisk, not ours) and reports that May’s “soft” deal threatens “to blow the government apart” – a far cry from its celebration of the referendum result, all that time ago. And a special mention goes to the New European with its somewhat arrestinginappropriate image of May appearing to struggle to keep her head above water.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The Dublin local authorities are set to fall well short of demands from Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy to provide 950 new homeless family hub units by the end of the year.The four Dublin councils combined expect to deliver just 142 new family hub spaces by the year end. In early September Mr Murphy wrote to Dublin local authority chief executives demanding more progress be made delivering hubs, and threatened to take powers to provide emergency accommodation under the control of his department if targets were missed. In a report to Mr Murphy, Eileen Gleeson, head of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE), said achieving the family hub targets “will not be possible” by the end of 2018. The targets set “are very challenging in the context of the current property market in the Dublin area”, the report said. Family hubs were introduced as an alternative to housing homeless families in hotel rooms, and most provide cooking and recreational facilities, as well as support services. Dublin City Council said it expected to deliver 47 units between two new hubs by the end of the year, well below its target of 300. South Dublin County Council (39 units) and Fingal County Council (48) would also miss targets for an extra 300 hub spaces each. There was a pipeline of 500 planned extra hub units across the four local authorities, but only 213 were confirmed to be delivered in 2019. Negotiations over properties for further hubs hoped to be opened next year were still ongoing, a spokeswoman for DRHE said. In the past two years 20 family hubs have been opened in Dublin, providing 500 spaces for homeless families.Senior figures across the local authorities said since Mr Murphy had written to chief executives, there had been a realisation the initial targets were “unrealistic”. Difficulties sourcing appropriate properties outside of the city centre to convert into hubs had also been relayed to the Minister. Two senior sources in separate Dublin councils suggested the targets were more likely an attempt to provide political cover for Mr Murphy, than to be achievable aims expected to be met. There were barriers to securing properties seen as potential hubs, including “excessive demands on price, conditions of properties, unsuitable locations, competition from developers”, the homeless executive’s report said. A spokesman for the Department of Housing said following the indication that targets would not be met by councils, Mr Murphy would “keep all delivery options open”. The DRHE report said while hubs were an appropriate response to families in homelessness, the ultimate goal should “put a greater emphasis” on longer term housing solutions. Statistics showed a third of families presenting as homeless in Dublin were non-nationals, many of whom do not have entitlements to housing support, the report said. Current policy is to offer this cohort emergency accommodation on a night-by-night basis. However, legislation and guidance was “urgently needed” from the department on how these families should be dealt with into the future, the DRHE report said.

Photograph:  Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTheresa May faces a revolt within her party and a possible leadership challenge after she won her cabinet’s backing for a draft withdrawal agreement with the EU. Ministers backed the deal after a five-hour cabinet meeting which the prime minister described as impassioned, during which a number of the ministers spoke out against it.“The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop. But the collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration – this is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead,” Mrs May said after the meeting. The draft withdrawal agreement, running to 580 pages, seals the terms under which Britain leaves the EU. Its provisions, defining outstanding obligations and establishing a transition period in which both sides can adjust, range from iding up the common property, securing the rights of each others’ citizens and agreeing a departure bill for the UK. A protocol on Northern Ireland provides a backstop guarantee that will safeguard Ireland’s soft border, guarantees continued security co-operation, protects the Common Travel Area and safeguards both human rights and the 50 or so cross-Border programmes that have come out of the Belfast Agreement. Northern Ireland will remain in the same customs territory as the rest of the UK, but will be subject to the EU customs code and to some EU regulations.Britain will not be able to end the backstop unilaterally, and its governance will fall under the same structure as the rest of the withdrawal agreement, with an arbitration panel made up of two representatives from Britain, two from the EU and one independent member. Conservative Brexiteers said on Wednesday night they would vote against the deal when it is put to a vote in the House of Commons, probably early next month. A number of backbench MPs said they were writing to the chairman of the 1922 Committee seeking a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.Mrs May acknowledged that she faced a struggle in seeking parliamentary approval for the deal, but she insisted that it represented the best available option.“I know that there will be difficult days ahead. This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny, and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable. “But the choice was this deal, which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country, or going back to square one with more ision, more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum.” In Brussels on Wednesday night, European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker said the withdrawal agreement represents “decisive progress”.In Dublin, the publication of the text was greeted by the Government as meeting all its essential requirements on the backstop, especially that it was not time-limited and it would not be possible under the terms of the treaty for the UK to unilaterally bring the backstop to an end.Speaking at Government Buildings on Wednesday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was “one of the better days in politics”. Asked if the backstop in the draft treaty was “bulletproof” – the term he had used last December – Mr Varadkar said it was “even stronger than what we had back in December”.Ministers and officials in Dublin had maintained a strict silence all day on the terms of the agreement until Mrs May had secured the agreement of her cabinet.However, on Wednesday night Government sources were delighted with the outcome, while Fine Gael figures believed that the outcome would enhance Mr Varadkar’s standing politically, with talk of an early election again surfacing in Leinster House.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Once a subsequent agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom becomes applicable after the entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement, this Protocol shall then, from the date of application of such subsequent agreement and in accordance with the provisions of that agreement setting out the effect of that agreement on this Protocol, not apply or shall cease to apply, as the case may be, in whole or in part, notwithstanding Article 20.Extension of the transition period The United Kingdom, having had regard to progress made towards conclusion of the agreement referred to in Articles 1(4) and 2(1) of this Protocol, may at any time before 1 July 2020 request the extension of the transition period referred to in Article 126 of the Withdrawal Agreement. If the United Kingdom makes such a request, the transition period may be extended in accordance with Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement.Rights of iniduals1. The United Kingdom shall ensure that no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in that part of the 1998 Agreement entitled Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity results from its withdrawal from the Union, including in the area of protection against discrimination as enshrined in the provisions of Union law listed in Annex 1 to this Protocol, and shall implement this paragraph through dedicated mechanisms.2. The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.1. The United Kingdom and Ireland may continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories (the “Common Travel Area”), while fully respecting the rights of natural persons conferred by Union law.2. The United Kingdom shall ensure that the Common Travel Area and the associated rights and privileges can continue to apply without affecting the obligations of Ireland under Union law, in particular with respect to free movement for Union citizens and their family members, irrespective of their nationality, to, from and within Ireland.Single customs territory, movement of goods1. Until the future relationship becomes applicable, a single customs territory between the Union and the United Kingdom shall be established (“the single customs territory”). Accordingly, Northern Ireland is in the same customs territory as Great Britain.(a) the customs territory of the Union defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 9522013 and(b) the customs territory of the United Kingdom.The rules set out in Annex 2 to this Protocol shall apply in respect of all trade in goods between the territories referred to in the second subparagraph, as well as, where so provided, between the single customs territory and third countries.

Where appropriate, the Joint Committee may modify Annex 4 in order to lay down higher standards for these level playing field conditions.The Joint Committee shall adopt before 1 July 2020 the detailed rules relating to trade in goods between the two parts of the single customs territory for the implementation of this paragraph. In the absence of such a decision adopted before 1 July 2020, Annex 3 shall apply.By derogation from the third subparagraph, fishery and aquaculture products, as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 13792013 (“fishery and aquaculture products”), shall not be covered by the rules set out in Annexes 2 and 4, as well as the rules referred to in the fourth subparagraph, unless an agreement on access to waters and fishing opportunities is applicable between the Union and the United Kingdom. In accordance with Article 184 of the Withdrawal Agreement, the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify such an agreement before 1 July 2020.The Joint Committee may adopt decisions amending Annex 3 to this Protocol, where such amendments are necessary for the proper functioning of this paragraph.

Legislation as defined in point (2) of Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 9522013 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall apply to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland (not including the territorial waters of the United Kingdom). However, the Joint Committee shall establish the conditions, including in quantitative terms, under which certain fishery and aquaculture products brought into the customs territory of the Union defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 9522013 by vessels flying the flag of the United Kingdom and registered in Northern Ireland are exempted from duties.The provisions of Union law listed in Annex 5 to this Protocol shall also apply, under the conditions set out therein, to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland.Articles 30 and 110 TFEU shall apply to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland.Quantitative restrictions on exports and imports shall be prohibited between the Union and Northern Ireland.Protection of the UK internal market1.

Photograph: Ludovic MarinAFPGetty ImagesWriting of Benito Mussolini’s brand of now-reviving nationalism, the Italian political scientist Alberto Mingardi makes a telling, and not very flattering, comparison with his inheritors in Rome’s government today. They have embarked on a major battle with the EU over what is seen in Brussels as a wildly reckless budget.Mingardi notes that the dictator made strenuous efforts to balance the country’s budget, not “because he wanted to establish his country as self-sufficient. He was determined to make Italy great again, and he knew that beggars can’t be choosers.“It is making a reckless gambit predicated on the idea that Italy is too big to fail, and will therefore be rescued by other member countries, for fear of financial contagion.”Whether the EU will bail out Italy is far from clear. Il Duce will be spinning in his grave.When Emmanuel Macron last weekend spoke at the French Armistice commemoration of the dangers of nationalism and of “old demons” resurfacing, threatening peace, it was inevitable that he would be interpreted as taking a swipe at Donald Trump seated only a few paces away.At a Houston rally in late October, ahead of the midterms, Trump himself said “I’m a nationalist, okay? I’m a nationalist. Nationalist. Use that word.”We are inevitably obsessed with Trump and tend to be drawn into his narcissistic, self-obsessed world view. In truth, however, Macron certainly had a wider target in what was in effect a reprise of public clashes with Italy’s populist government and other old demons that are rising again much closer to home in Europe.Describing himself as a patriot, Macron spoke very much in the spirit of De Gaulle: “Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. In saying ‘our interests first, whatever happens to the others’, you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: its moral values.“History,” he said , “sometimes threatens to take its tragic course again and compromise our hope of peace.” He warned that the traces of the first World War had never been erased from Europe nor the Middle East.True. And yet Macron’s post-nationalist Europe narrative is very simplistic. It does not explain why that legacy remains, what was so enduring in the forces he decries. Or how it was the games played by the great powers in carving up Europe after the first World War – not least the particularly oppressive French demands for reparations from Germany – that later fanned the rise of fascism and Nazism.As Leonid Bershidsky writes for Bloomberg: “By breaking up the loose, senescent Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires, the winners of World War I, primarily the British and the French, freed up the nationalisms that had festered within them. It wasn’t always for the worse initially – but it invariably backfired.”Hungarian nationalism, he points out, one of the European Union’s biggest problems, feeds on the resentments created by the post-war Treaty of Trianon in 1920, when the Allies cut off 72 per cent of Hungary’s territory.In the wake of the second World War, the confining of eastern Europe under Soviet rule bottled up the nationalist impulses, which have since given vent to\u0026nbspforms of virulent xenophobia and Euroscepticism in countries such as Poland and Hungary.Europe’s leaders have to do more than condemn nationalism – they have to show that the EU, successfully blamed by populism for everything from migration to economic stagnation, can actually do something to resolve the problems that feed nationalism.In Europe, Macron wants to push ahead with ambitious integration plans despite the reservations of many EU member states, Bershidsky writes, urging caution. “Great power thinking, itself born of nationalism, whether it’s stated, as in President Donald Trump’s case, or hotly denied, as in Macron’s, provokes nationalism and breeds conflicts in the smaller countries, just as it ended up doing after the first World War.”\u0026nbspNot to mention in the delicate flower that is Italy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3698055.1542234853!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit q a what s the withdrawal agreement and what happens next","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK prime minister Theresa May announced, after a marathon meeting, that her cabinet had approved the proposed Brexit orce deal. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire.UK prime minister Theresa May announced, after a marathon meeting, that her cabinet had approved the proposed Brexit orce deal agreed by EU and UK officials earlier this week. Shortly after her announcement, the European Commission published the 585-page agreement including “a protocol” covering the so-called backstop that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after the UK leaves the EU.It is the insurance policy within the orce deal that maintains the open Irish border in the event of the EU and UK failing to find an alternative, better solution in any future relationship they agree on.No, both sides agreed there should be a backstop in the withdrawal agreement but they had until this week failed to agree the detail and text of a backstop that would make it legally operable - in other words, workable.There are a few things but the biggest difference is that this backstop will involve, in the absence of a future deal, the whole of the UK staying aligned with the EU customs union instead of just a specific rule applying to Northern Ireland as was originally proposed when the EU first suggested a backstop earlier this year. It is in a way. To keep other EU member states happy with this arrangement, Brussels and London have agreed a set of measures to ensure there is a level playing field between the EU and the UK. This is to ensure that, should the backstop come into effect, the UK would have no competitive advantages over the EU. No, not on its own. The draft agreement says, under the backstop, the EU’s custom code will continue to apply to Northern Ireland, meaning that it can continue to export and sell products within the EU. This will ensure Northern Irish businesses will face no restrictions on their products when selling into the EU single market. The UK has also agreed, under the terms of this new backstop, that Northern Ireland will remain aligned with a limited set of rules relating to the EU’s single market, specifically legislation covering goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls, rules on agricultural products, Vat, excise on goods and state aid rules. All this would ensure that there would be no new border checks on the island of Ireland. The draft agreement aims to address this too. It says there is nothing in it that shall prevent the UK from “ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK’s internal market”. The deal aims to make goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK as frictionless as possible and to minimise checks. A joint committee made up of EU and UK representatives will keep this “under constant review” and adopt appropriate recommendations to avoid “to the extent possible” controls at the ports and airports of Northern Ireland concerning any goods coming in from the UK. Yes, it achieves what the Government had hoped it would: it is legally operable, it is not time-limited and has no end-date. Crucially, the backstop in this agreement cannot be unilaterally ended by the UK, which is what the British Brexit secretary Dominic Raab had sought, drawing strong objections from Dublin.If, after the transition period, either the EU or UK believes the backstop, in whole or part, is no longer necessary, they will notify the other side. The joint committee will consider the request and may seek the opinion of institutions created under the 1998 Belfast Agreement. If the EU and UK fail to agree a deal on their future relationship by December 31st, 2020 - the current scheduled end of the standstill transition period when no rules change - the backstop will apply until a subsequent agreement is in place. Alternatively, the UK can, before July 1st, 2020, request an extension to the transition period. This must come from the aforementioned joint committee. Once the withdrawal agreement is endorsed by the EU leaders at the European council, it must be ratified by the EU and UK parliaments. Given the opposition of politicians in Britain and Northern Ireland, Westminster will be the next arena for battle over this orce deal.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Trump would not be the first powerful man to see in an impudent junior a trace of his younger self. Photograph: Vincent KesslerReutersConservatives know liberal panic about the 45th US president as “Trump derangement syndrome”. Less diagnosed, though presenting similar symptoms, is Macron vexation disorder.Something about the president of France – his youth, his Molière-quoting polish – makes populists around the world hope for his failure with a zeal that verges on backhanded compliment.It is soothing to believe that, with different leaders, Europe and the US will close the rift that was so exposed in last weekend’s Armistice centennial. But this is to treat personal squabbles as the problem, not larger trends. Emmanuel Macron deplored the “nationalism” of Donald Trump, who in turn questioned French martial prowess. Both jibes were too stale to land.The Great War was a folly of multinational empires, not nation states. As for French defeat, the armchair commandos of the Anglo-American right should reflect on what it is to share a land border with a larger enemy.Presidents come and go, as do their tiffs. Even these two rub along at times: Trump would not be the first powerful man to see in an impudent junior a trace of his younger self.Just do not expect the estrangement of Europe and the US to stop. Their alliance, which is discussed as though it were as fixed a feature of the universe as the gravitational constant, was improvised for counter-Soviet purposes. In 1945, Washington could not let the razed continent turn red.When that existential goal was met in 1989, cross-Atlantic disparities in attitudes and interests – transcended, after a fashion, in the cold war – became unmistakable. Quarrels over the Balkans, climate change and Iraq long predate Trump. Others, as yet unknown, will post-date him.The attitudinal gap between Europe and the US has hardly narrowed since Robert Kagan described it in Of Paradise and Power, 15 years ago.In his anti-nationalism, Macron still speaks for most of his continent: the latest Eurobarometer poll, from March, records the highest support for the EU since 1983. Continentals often associate the nation state with war and misgovernment as reflexively as Americans equate it with freedom and glory.Neither side is “right”, just informed by a past that is quite its own.This difference in perspective extends to the means of official violence. Trump is not a total fabulist when he chafes at Nato and its uneven burdens. Europe’s relative underspending on defence is there in the numbers, and is suggestive of a different culture with different priorities.The nation state and its proper degree of hard power: even without broaching religion, these are epic subjects for supposed partners to disagree on.The two poles of the west are entwined by ancestral culture, some will say: ancient Greece, ancient Rome, the Enlightenment. But this was true when Britain torched the White House in 1812.It was true when the US fought Spain in 1898. It was true when the US tarried before joining the world wars. The insistent voice of self-interest has drowned out any mystic chords before, and could do so again.None of which is to suggest that Europe and America will come into active conflict, just that they will grow apart as their interests point them to different areas of the world. Europe has a southern frontier with Africa to tend.Its citizens, tiring of immigration, prioritise few things more. Meanwhile, geography, power politics and a population increasingly of non-European descent draw Washington’s focus to Asia and Latin America.Even Barack Obama, a mostly orthodox foreign policy president, aspired to a more Pacific than Atlantic posture.Europe and the US will still have common enemies (terrorism) and zones of interest (Russia, the Middle East). But what gave rise to “the west” in its modern usage was a Soviet menace that has no modern equivalent, yet.Even if we date the alliance back to 1917, when the US entered the first World War, it accounts for a minority of American history and a sliver of European history. If Nato and other items of cold war architecture now lapse into a kind of benign disrepair, it is not all the work of Trump.The wonder is that they held as well as they did between 1989 and now.Unless readers can suggest one, political language has no word for a state of relations that is cooler than “allies” and warmer than “rivals”. Allies act in concert towards the same purpose. Rivals vie for primacy.Whatever noun splits the difference, we might be using it to describe Europe and the US in 20 years. They need not fall out. But nor must they have all that much to do with each other. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

His research has helped to confirm them as the only known Michelangelo bronzes in existence.“Being an observant person, both as a doctor and a scientist, I noticed that the toes on the bronzes were a bit odd,” he said.“I then went and had a look at all the toes that I could find anywhere in Michelangelo’s oeuvre. Out of 40 toes, all except for two fitted this brief: they had a short big toe and a long second toe, and the big toe goes outwards - it looks like someone is wearing a flip-flop in between the toes.“In the Sistine Chapel, David, Moses, they all have the same toes. There are certain traits that shine through in an artist’s work.”Prof Abrahams, who combines his work at Warwick Medical School with a keen interest in art history, says he can now instantly tell a real Michelangelo foot from a fake.The Michelangelo toe is abducted - facing away from the other toes to leave a noticeable gapHe also found other physical clues to link the bronzes to Michelangelo. The two men - one young, one older and bearded - have rippled torsos. “We all know a six-pack, but these guys actually have an eight-pack,” he said, something seen in very few people. “I found two statues and five Michelangelo drawings that have that same, rare anomaly, which tells me that the model he used for those was the same model he used for these bronzes.“They look slightly on steroids, slightly pumped up, like bodybuilders. But if you were a guy lifting masonry stone you would have very developed muscles.”Another indicator was the presence of the sartorius muscle in the legs. The muscle is not outwardly visible, leading Prof Abrahams to conclude that only an artist who had dissected bodies would know of its existence.When Prof Abrahams was told that the bronzes likely dated to the early 1500s, he was surprised. “The first anatomy textbook was written in 1543 - we’re talking a generation later. So whoever made these beautiful bronzes had actually seen under the skin.”He narrowed down to less than a dozen a list of artists known to have dissected bodies, and concluded that their work did not match the bronzes.The statues “took my breath away”, Prof Abrahams said. “Of course, they’re beautiful, but what I’m talking about is anatomical, scientific accuracy.”Another factor was the pubic hair. Almost every male classical and Renaissance sculpture has pubic hair arranged “in a triangle going down towards the genitalia”, he explained. In Michelangelo’s work, “the triangle goes up towards the umbilicus, not the other way around”.The \u0026#39eight-pack\u0026#39 is another hallmark of Michelangelo sculpture, according to Prof AbrahamsProf Abrahamson’s evidence is featured in a new book, Michelangelo: Sculptor in Bronze, which draws together the work of various experts.The bronzes were first recorded as being the work of Michelangelo in 1878, when they were owned by the Rothschild family, but the attribution was later in doubt. They last changed hands at Sotheby’s in 2002 for £1.65 million, when they were bought by a private collector, and remain known as the \u0027Rothschild bronzes\u0027.A team from Cambridge University and the Fitzwilliam reattributed them to Michelangelo in 2015 and invited experts from various disciplines to contribute further research, which has now confirmed their findings.They commissioned technical analysis at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam which found that the bronzes date from the early 1500s.The book also details 30 little-known letters from Michelangelo to his family, written in 1506-08, in which he writes about working in bronze. He is known to have made three major bronze sculptures, none of which survive.Dr Eike Schmidt, director of the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, described the research as a “game-changer”. He said: “It provides a completely new - and indeed long overdue - interdisciplinary approach to Michelangelo studies.“It proves what can be achieved when there is genuine collaboration between internationally-regarded experts in fields as erse as art history, conservation science, anatomy and technical archaeology.”Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May braced for backlash in CommonsComment: May\u0026#39s catastrophic plan poisons the well for her successorsBrexit deal: What Theresa May promised - and what she deliveredI\u0026#39m a Brexiteer, but this deal is a good oneComment: British business should be wary of Mrs May\u0026#39s planBBC in a \u0026#39mess\u0026#39 over presenters\u0026#39 tax affairs, say MPs Eurosceptics agree at last: ‘Brexit has been bungled’Brexit deal latest news: Cabinet backs Theresa May\u0026#39s plan but leadership challenge could come amid Tory furyDonald Trump pushes out senior advisor after Melania\u0026#39s interventionStormy Daniels lawyer arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of domestic violence\u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 ordered hits on \u0026#39own family\u0026#39 - and favourite weapon was  \u0026#39diamond-encrusted pistol\u0026#39British universities fall behind in employability rankings as foreign institutions teach courses in EnglishNHS staff shortages could triple in a decade, think tanks warnSupermarkets flood Britain with 59 billion pieces of plastic each yearJohn Lewis Christmas advert: Elton John plays piano in heartwarming videoMiddle class drivers uses could be fueling criminal activity by using illegal car washesDoctor Who festive special to air on New Year\u0026#39s Day instead of Christmas DayHow Brexit Cabinet erupted with a \u0026#39massive bust-up\u0026#39 between Esther McVey and Theresa MayBrexit deal: What is it and what happens next? We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/26/08/rts1zkhu.jpg","title":"amazon new headquarters new york city long island arlington hq","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsTechnology firm\u0026nbspto invest $5bn\u0026nbspacross two sites and create 25,000 new jobs in eachClick to followThe IndependentAmazon has picked New York City and Arlington, Virginia as the locations for its new headquarters, ending a much-hyped selection process that saw cities across the US offer an array of incentives in attempts to woo the technology firm.Amazon\u0026nbspsaid on Tuesday it would invest $5bn\u0026nbsp(£3.8bn) across the two sites and create 25,000 new jobs in each.

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

Nomos was established in Glashütte in 1990 by Roland\u0026nbspSchwertner, a fashion photographer and computer scientist from West Germany, and now employs 300 people from 20 nations.Italy far-right government offers land to parents who have third childFar-right parties overtake Macron for first time in France pollMI5 agents to take lead in fight against far-right extremism“Glashütte as we know it today would simply not have been possible without the reunification of Germany, and without the freedom and democracy that brought,” says Uwe Ahrendt, chief executive. “Furthermore, we have employees that need our protection those that the far right would claim \u0027don’t belong here\u0027. But we know that they do.”Ahrendt became the chief executive of\u0026nbspNomos in 2000. The company was shocked to discover\u0026nbspthat in the 2017 federal elections, over a third of Glashütte residents had voted for the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\u0026nbspSince spring 2018, Nomos has worked with Open Saxony, a Government-funded programme, to provide free workshops and training to its employees where they\u0026nbspcheck the accuracy of right-wing views and provide emotional support to staff. Ahrendt says: “We realised that we need to position ourselves clearly and publicly in support of our democratic political system.”Glashütte in East Germany is known as mini-Switzerland for its thriving watchmaking industry (Courtesy Photo)German businesses have another good reason embrace ersity: the country will be short of 3 million workers by 2020, according to a 2017 report by Prognos, an economic research institute, worsening to a shortage of 3.3 million by 2040 as the native population ages.\u0026nbspSkilled migrants are being seen as a way to plug the gaps. A new immigration law, introduced on October 2, aims to attract more workers from countries outside the EU. Steffen Kampeter, chief executive of the Confederation of German Employers\u0027 Associations has said Germany’s international competitiveness depends upon “qualified workers from abroad”.The state is funding efforts to improve ersity in German businesses who may not have considered hiring migrants in the past. At a recent meeting organised by Netzwerk Courage, a network that promotes democracy, business leaders, trade union representatives and groups working with migrants came together to discuss how they can improve ersity in East German businesses.Petra Köpping, the minister for integration in Saxony, said that for years, East Germany has not worked towards making the workforce more erse. Over time, it has fallen behind. Now it needs to work even harder to catch up. Petra Köpping herself employs 45 staff – 18 of which come from overseas.Marlis Straessner-Lacroix\u0026nbspis from the organisation Willkommon in Lobtau, which has been helping asylum seekers in the Lobtau district of Dresden since 2014. She said that in many cases, businesses show a lack of interest in employing migrants, even when approached by organisations who have the resources to help.Nomos employs 300 people from 20 nations (Courtesy Photo)Glashütte is not your average East German town. It exports tens of thousands of luxury watches every year from 10 high-end watchmakers, some of which sell timepieces for millions of pounds. The industry started in the mid-1800s, when Ferdinand Adolph Lange enlisted financial support from local nobility to start manufacturing watches as means to employ impoverished local people.Like all East Germany industries, Glashütte\u0027s watch factories were taken over by\u0026nbspthe Soviet-supported East German state after the Second World War. When this regime collapsed, many workers fled to the West. Whole towns were hollowed out. Glashütte was revived in part by incomers like Walter Lange, the great-grandson of Ferdinand, who returned from the West to revive old brands alongside new ones, like Nomos.Many other East German towns never experienced the same renaissance. Even today, East Germans are still paid less than West Germans and work longer hours. The average annual gross wage in the former East German states is €30,172, almost €5,000 less than in states in the former West Germany, according to official data provided to\u0026nbspthe socialist Left party.For some, a sense of injustice has hardened into a fear of the outsider since Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed migrants to Germany in 2015. Ahrendt says far-right riots in the nearby town of Chemnitz\u0026nbspin August\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspmade the company’s efforts to promote democracy seem even more essential: “We wanted to set a precedent, because an intolerant, racist atmosphere will not be permitted at Nomos\u0026nbspGlashütte.”Some businesses and organisations have reported that since the AfD has gained more support in elections, the number of applicants from overseas has decreased. Dr Michael Genkin, the leader of a visitors programme that welcomes international scientists to the Max Planck research institute in Dresden, says that after 2015, Saxony became less attractive for workers of all kinds. “We indeed had the impression of a decreasing number of applicants at our institute around the time of those political developments in Saxony, and in Dresden specifically,” he says, noting that the number of applicants was too small to draw a statistical conclusion.Ahrendt says events in Chemnitz and elsewhere have shown the world a darker side to German politics that it is up to responsible businesses to counter.“My company is concerned about this image,” he says. “We want to show that there is a brighter side to Germany, especially in Saxony. When you are close by, Chemnitz is just a little place in Germany but when you are far away, it represents all of Germany.”10 best watches for menThe workshops at Nomos are booked out until the end of the year. “That is great news, especially since they are voluntary and take place within work hours,” Ahrendt says. “From our point of view, everyone should work to protect freedom and democracy—and perhaps even more so in Saxony, since it was something that we fought for in 1989.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit is avoided, a further fall back in inflation and a rise in nominal wage growth should spur a sustained consumer recovery next year.”“We still think that CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget in the first quarter\u0026nbspand will average just 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspin 2019,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.Separately, the ONS reported\u0026nbspon Wednesday that annual factory gate prices rose 3.3 per cent in the month, up from 3.1 per cent in September and coming in ahead of City estimates.The statistics body\u0026nbspestimated\u0026nbspthat average UK house price growth\u0026nbsppicked up to 3.5 per cent year on year in September, up from 3.1 per cent in August.Prices fell 0.3 per cent in London over the period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have created a high-ranking committee to examine all the risks, including those raised by the IMF and the US Treasury, and those discussed during the public hearings on the legislation.The issues laid out by the IMF include reputational\u0026nbsprisks and a danger of losing its correspondent banking relationship (CBR) with the US dollar.Given these sorts of issues, the authorities expect it will take a few years to issue the cryptocurrency, the IMF report concluded.Moreover, they will only issue the SOV\u0026nbsponce its use complies with the FATF\u0026nbsp(Financial Action Task Force) standard and US regulation, and once its use in transactions in the US financial system has been approved by the US government.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Meanwhile, Germany has more than doubled its number of institutions in the top 150.Experts say the international outlook of Asian universities-\u0026nbsp and the increased use of the English language in universities in other countries - are key factors for the UK’s decline.\u0026nbspFirms increasingly cite East Asian institutions as top producers of workplace-ready graduates. South Korea has leapt from one university in the top 150 in 2011 to six this year, the report says.Simon Baker, data editor at THE, said: “The new data analysis reveals a substantial global shift in graduate employability this decade. We see a dramatically improved performance within East Asia and parts of Europe.\u0026nbsp“By-and-large, the highest risers are those equipping students with softer skills increasingly favoured among recruiters, such as teamwork –combined with the strongest possible industry experience.”He added: “In contrast, we can also track the extent of the decline since 2011 among traditionally dominant countries like the US and UK.\u0026nbsp“The increasingly international outlook of Asian universities, as well as the use of English becoming more widespread – removing a natural competitive advantage of the UK and US – have been two key factors behind this.”Created with Sketch.Best Universities for Life Sciences and Medicine Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “As the recent CBIPearson report shows, the demand for UK graduates by UK employers is still strong, and continues to grow.”\u0026nbspBut he added: “It is clear that to maintain our world leading position we must start matching our competitors’ increased investment in higher education.\u0026nbsp“Rumours of a cut in tuition fees, together with the impact of Brexit on research funding, and uncertainty over the status of international staff and students, risk putting the global reputation of our universities at risk.”Number of universities included in 2018 rankingNumber of universities included in 2011 rankingShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe traffic misdirection, known as a border gateway protocol (BGP) hijacking, lasted for around an hour and a half on Monday evening, ending at around 10.30pm GMT.ThousandEyes\u0026nbspexecutive Alex Henthorn-Iwane\u0026nbspsaid it was the worst incident affecting Google traffic that his firm had ever seen. He also speculated that the hijacking may have been the result of a war-game experiment.The incident\u0026nbspwas particularly suspicious because internet\u0026nbsptraffic was being sent to the Chinese government’s\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprovider, China Telecom, which has previously been accused of improperly\u0026nbsprouting\u0026nbsptraffic through China.A report\u0026nbspearlier this year by researchers at the US Naval War College and Tel Aviv University found\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspTelecom has\u0026nbspbeen hijacking internet\u0026nbsptraffic passing through the US and Canada on a regular basis.Conveniently, China Telecom has ten strategically placed, Chinese controlled internet ‘points of presence’4 (PoPs) across the internet backbone of North America, the report\u0026nbspstated.\u0026nbspVast rewards can be reaped from the hijacking, erting, and then copying of information-rich traffic going into or crossing the United States and Canada – often unnoticed and then delivered with only small delays.A Google spokesperson told The Independent: “We’re aware that a portion of internet traffic was affected by incorrect routing of IP addresses, and access to some Google services was impacted. The root cause of the issue was external to Google and there was no compromise of Google services.”In an update to its Google Cloud Status Dashboard, Google said it was conducting an internal investigation in the hope of\u0026nbspmaking\u0026nbspappropriate improvements to help prevent a future recurrence of the issue.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.After examining the remains, Professor Atterholt and her colleagues found that Mirarce had a larger breastbone than any other enantiornithines that had been discovered.\u0026nbspThis would have allowed sizeable flight muscles to attach, and suggests this group evolved the power of advanced flight separately from modern birds’ ancestors.Rough patches on the bones known as “quill knobs”, which anchor wing feathers to the skeleton, are further evidence of Mirarce’s capacity for advanced flight.Birds ‘had to learn to fly again’ after meteor killed dinosaursThe question of why only modern bird ancestors survived mass extinction has been a hot topic of debate, and the discovery that this long-extinct species of enantiornithine was an expert flyer has further puzzled the palaeontologists analysing it.\u0026nbsp“We find their fossils on every continent, all over the world, and their fossils are very, very common, in a lot of areas more common than the group that led to modern birds,” said Professor Atterholt.“And yet modern birds survived the extinction while enantiornithines go extinct.”One explanation for this is that enantiornithines lived primarily in forests, and when the trees were set ablaze following the asteroid strike they vanished with them.“I think it is a really interesting hypothesis and the best explanation I have heard so far,” said Professor Atterholt.\u0026nbsp“But we need to do really rigorous studies of enantiornithines’ ecology, because right now that part of the puzzle is a little hand-wavey.”All bird groups originally evolved from a group of predatory dinosaurs called theropods that included well-known species like Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor.While Mirarce would have looked fairly similar to modern birds, it probably had teeth in its beak and claws on its wings that betrayed its dinosaur ancestry.This study was published in the journal PeerJ.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This sand was transported by the glacier from the bottom of the impact crater to the ice margin, and it has yielded a wealth of information on the impact (Svend Funder)“While it requires more research, we consider it possible that the Cape York irons may have been outer fragments or even boulders on the surface of the main meteorite.\u0026nbspWe suspect these initially detached in Earth’s gravity field and then decelerated as they entered the atmosphere to fall south of the Hiawatha crater.”Professor Kurt H\u0026nbspKjær, lead author of the research\u0026nbspfrom the Natural History Museum of Denmark, said: “The crater is exceptionally well-preserved and that is surprising, because glacier ice is an incredibly efficient erosive agent that would have quickly removed traces of the impact.“The next step in the investigation will be to confidently date the impact.\u0026nbspThis will be a challenge because it will probably require recovering material that melted during the impact from the bottom of the structure, but this is crucial if we are to understand how the Hiawatha impact affected life on Earth.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The precision of new measurements continues to improve, opening the doors to new parameters of space, such as super-Earth planets in cool orbits like Barnard\u0027s star b.The scientists want to collect more data to confirm the planet’s presence, and say it could provide an excellent target to test using the latest in space observation technology such as\u0026nbspNasa’s planned Wide Field Infra Red Survey Telescope.If using such technologies they can observe the planet directly, it will open up their understanding of the kinds of planets that are forming around other stars in distant space.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It should have been sorted out amicably\u0027Click to followThe IndependentResidents of\u0026nbspan idyllic, car-free Channel Island\u0026nbspcould be forced to leave as\u0026nbsppower and water are set to be turned off within weeks amid a pay row.The 500-strong population of Sark fear a\u0026nbspfull evacuation as the sole energy provider has vowed to shut down and cut off the power supply at the end of the month.The situation, which has been described by politicians as resembling a “war-time mentality”, has been caused by a dispute over prices.And in an unprecedented letter to all residents, Sark Electricity Ltd said the island would be plunged into a “public health emergency”\u0026nbspif local people remained after the planned cut-off date of 30 November.The island’s government is now desperately trying to draw up contingency plans to ensure there is electricity in several key buildings if power is cut.The dispute between SEL and the island’s government, known as Chief Pleas, began earlier this year when price controller commissioner Anthony White ordered the utility firm to reduce its price per kWh from 66p to 52p from August following long-standing cost concerns.The company, which powers 300 homes with its diesel generator, says that it has since lost £20,000 a month and no longer has the funds to continue with a legal challenge to the order.In the letter David Gordon-Brown, the firm’s managing director, said: “Without the electricity to provide water, the government would quickly have a public health emergency if it allows anyone to remain on Sark.“So, although we will not be providing a general supply beyond the end of the month, we will work with the Medical and Emergency Services Committee to make sure that doctors and essential emergency services can function for another week beyond the end of the month to cover the transition period as everyone moves off the island.”Speaking after sending the letter, Mr Gordon-Brown said he could not see any situation where the residents would be able to remain.He added: “I hate to say it but people will have no option but to leave. That is the fact of the matter as there will be no electricity.“Chief Pleas want to put together a contingency plan but I don’t think they are capable of doing that – they are a dysfunctional government. Chief Pleas will just do what they always do, and that is nothing.“The only hope is to get someone independent in to bang some heads together and if they want to bang mine,\u0026nbspthat’s fine. I am up for it. It is a very sad state of affairs.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-European Union, anti-Brexit demonstrators hold placards and wave Union and EU flags as they protest outside of the Houses of Parliament.

The far right figurehead whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon faces a rehearing after winning an appeal against a contempt of court finding last month.Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers a keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in LiverpoolSark is famous as one of the few remaining places in the world where cars are banned from roads and only tractors and horse-drawn vehicles are allowed.In 2011 it also become the first official ‘Dark Sky Island’ in the world due to its efforts to minimise light pollution.William Raymond, deputy chairman of Sark’s Policy and Finance Committee, said that residents were becoming increasingly concerned at the looming cut-off date.He said: “We are drawing up contingency plans as pressure builds as we move towards the 30th. We have to make sure that island residents are in a secure position.“It is the letter, in which the company’s managing director talked about people having to leave Sark, which has really upset people here.“There is so much uncertainty and worry.”Mr Raymond said he was confident a mass exodus could be avoided “if we can get our contingency plans in place”.He added: “They are in the development stage at the moment so I can’t give out too much details, but it will involve consolidating around certain centres – making sure there are certain buildings that have power so people can congregate there.“It really is a war-time mentality. Do you really expect people to be living like this in the 21st century?”Boy speeding on electric scooter given six points on future licenceDeputy Peter Ferbrache, president of Guernsey States’ Trading Supervisory Board, this week said he hoped Guernsey Electricity could step in “if the lights are definitely going to go out”.However, it is not clear how the firm could practically be able to provide electricity to the island.Mr Gordon-Brown dismissed the idea and added: “The last thing Guernsey Electricity want to do is get involved with Sark politics.”Tony Le Lieve, chairman of Sark’s Chamber of Commerce, said that residents and businesses were now genuinely concerned about what would happen.He said: “With no power and no water, we wouldn’t be able to live here. It should have been sorted out amicably.“We should not be three weeks away from our power being switched off. I hope someone with some common sense will get the two parties to sit down, perhaps with a mediator who is independent and can look at the situation from both sides.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That was their\u0026nbspdirection of travel.The revelation came after Ms May held a lengthy meeting in her House of Commons office with DUP\u0026nbspleader Arlene Foster, followed, at 10pm, by a 20-minute meeting with Jeremy Corbyn. She also spoke by phone with Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales\u0027 Carwyn Jones and Sinn Fein leaders.\u0026nbspThe order of parliamentary votes on Ms May\u0027s proposed agreement has been a matter of fierce debate, with opposition parties insisting that amendments must be considered before the vote on the motion itself.\u0026nbspSome MPs\u0026nbspbelieve this would give them the opportunity to force the government to meet certain conditions, either relating to\u0026nbspthe substance of the deal or to\u0026nbspa fresh public vote.The Commons procedure committee is considering the issue and is set\u0026nbspto make a recommendation on the order in which votes should be held.Opposition parties said they believed No 10 had recognised growing calls for MPs\u0026nbspto be allowed to vote on the amendments first.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThey\u0027re coming\u0026nbspunder a lot of pressure from all sides, said one source.\u0026nbspThey were clearly aware of that pressure.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.”The cabinet’s backing, however, means the EU are set to give the green light to a\u0026nbspEuropean Council\u0026nbspsummit at the end of November, which if successful could see a vote on the draft deal in the house of commons in early December.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit is avoided, a further fall back in inflation and a rise in nominal wage growth should spur a sustained consumer recovery next year.”“We still think that CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget in the first quarter\u0026nbspand will average just 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspin 2019,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.Separately, the ONS reported\u0026nbspon Wednesday that annual factory gate prices rose 3.3 per cent in the month, up from 3.1 per cent in September and coming in ahead of City estimates.The statistics body\u0026nbspestimated\u0026nbspthat average UK house price growth\u0026nbsppicked up to 3.5 per cent year on year in September, up from 3.1 per cent in August.Prices fell 0.3 per cent in London over the period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Europe and its security.”The suggestion angered Mr Trump, who sent a series of hostile tweets about the comments.On Tuesday the US president tweeted: “Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the US, China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One \u0026amp Two – How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the US came along. Pay for Nato or not!”The election of Mr Trump to the White House appears to have given more urgency to the cause of boosting the EU’s defence capabilities, with leaders warning they cannot simply rely on the United States.Commission president Mr Juncker said last year that “deference to Nato can no longer be used as a convenient alibi to argue against greater European efforts”.In 2016, then defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the UK would use its veto to stop the creation of any EU army. However, the UK is leaving the EU, and will therefore no longer have any say in its governance.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A crew member escorts a migrant child out of a plane transporting a group of 51 migrants from Niger, entitled to international protection, after its landing at the Mario De Bernardi military airport in Pratica di Mare, south of RomePalestinians gather in front of damaged buildings in Gaza City following Israeli air strikes targeting the area overnight.

But in what is considered largely as a victory by Brussels and Downing Street, Mrs May has secured a UK-wide Irish backstop, the insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The mechanism became Brexit\u0026rsquos most vexed issue because the EU\u0026rsquos own plan was used as the building blocks for what was agreed by the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Europe advisor Olly Robbins and his European Commission counterparts Michel Barnier and Sabine Weyand. After proclaiming \u0026ldquono British Prime Minister could accept the terms set out by Brussels, which would have essentially kept Northern Ireland locked in the EU\u0026rsquos customs union and single market for goods, Mrs May has now agreed a UK-wide approach to the backstop.                Brexit news: Customs union membership is now \u0027basis for the future\u0027                Brexit deal TODAY: What time will Cabinet meet TODAY?When does the Irish backstop come into force?As it stands, the mechanism will now take shape in the withdrawal agreement as a UK-wide customs union arrangement.This temporary insurance policy will come into force \u0026ldquounless and until a permanent solution to prevent a hard Irish border is found jointly by Brussels and Westminster.Because of the toxicity in the backstop, negotiators have included a review mechanism to avoid it ever being triggered.In July 2020, officials from both sides will come together to make a decision of how to proceed using three potential options.They will either say a UK-EU free trade agreement that avoids a hard Irish border has been agreed and the backstop is no longer needed, if a solution is within reach they can extend the 21-month transition period to allow more time for talks and finally, if all else fails, the backstop will be triggered.Brexit news: Theresa May agrees deal with EU and now must convince her Cabinet (Image: )Will the UK be chained to Brussels forever?Fearful Brexiteers believe allowing a UK-wide customs backstop with no \u0026ldquoindependent review mechanism would allow Brussels to essentially keep Britain locked in a start of constant limbo.Under the terms of the UK-wide backstop, Britain would be in a customs union with Brussels and therefore have to follow EU trade rules and be unable to sign independent trade deals in order to maintain a frictionless border.The rumoured backstop agreement can be described as a swimming pool \u0026ndash Great Britain would be in the shallow end while Northern Ireland is in the deep.The EU has insisted the original Northern Ireland-specific backstop is buried deep within the 500-page withdrawal agreement.In theory, this means if the UK Government grows sick of following EU trade rules and customs union membership it could remove Great Britain from backstop but the ultimate fallback would come into play and Northern Ireland would remain solely in the EU\u0026rsquos customs arrangement and single market for goods \u0026ndash creating a border in the Irish Sea.                What is the Brexit backstop? Has Northern Ireland been split from UK?                 Brexit deal TODAY: What time will Cabinet meet TODAY?Does this mean the European Court of Justice will have influence in Britain?Ultimately, the ECJ will be the final arbiter on issues involving EU law that may arise from the Irish backstop agreement.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has discussed a \u0026ldquojoint arbitration panel to break any future impasse during review negotiations surrounding the backstop.But EU officials believe such panels are not allowed to settle political disputes of this nature.Questions of interpreting EU law can only be settled by the ECJ, which will leave the Luxembourg-based courts with an important role to play in the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the backstop.Could the backstop become the future trading deal?Michel Barnier\u0026rsquos deputy Sabine Weyand told EU27 ambassadors last Friday that the UK-wide customs arrangement would become the \u0026ldquobasis of the future relationship.She said: \u0026ldquoWe should be in the best negotiation position for the future relationship.\u0026ldquoThis requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship.\u0026ldquoThey must align their rules but the EU will retain all controls. They apply the same rules.\u0026ldquoThe UK wants a lot more from the future relationship, so EU retains its leverage.Obviously this is still all to play for, but Brussels feels like it is in a strong negotiating position moving forward.

A future trade deal \u0026ldquowon\u0026rsquot need much time, according to the negotiator who stressed the UK and EU\u0026rsquos tradition as close partners make the agreement easier to reach. But his words will continue to infuriate Brexiteers in the UK who have been hypercritical of the Prime Minister for potentially allowing the UK to slip into a permanent customs union with the EU.                Brexit news: Verhofstadt warns May that Brussels will decide on dealMr Barnier told reporters in Brussels that both sides are drawing up plans for a \u0026ldquofree trade area based on regulatory and customs cooperation for the basis of their future relationship.He said: We\u0026rsquore drawing the basis for an ambitious partnership which we want which is a free trade area based on regulatory and customs cooperation in depth and with a Level Playing Field.\u0026ldquoOur objective is to abolish customs duties and quotas for all goods based on what we\u0026rsquore proposing in the withdrawal agreement, a single customs territory.Of course, as the EU Council gave me a mandate, that will be the condition of the new agreement on fisheries will apply.Brexit news: Michel Barnier outlines plan for UK\u0027s future EU partnership (Image: )There will be no tariffs on goods and indeed it is legitimate for that proposal to be flanked by a level playing field that\u0026rsquos a voluntary deliberate agreement between two parties who respect each other.\u0026ldquoThis agreement offers a basis for future negotiations and that is in our common interest.\u0026nbspHe added: We\u0026rsquore preparing and we\u0026rsquoll be ready to start that negotiation the very day after the UK withdraws from the EU on the 30 March 2019.Negotiators from the UK and EU eventually agreed on a UK-wide customs backstop as the final insurance policy of avoiding a hard Irish border.Last Friday, Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos Deputy Sabine Weyand said the \u0026ldquobasis for the future arrangement should be the UK-wide customs backstop.A joint EU-UK report published alongside the withdrawal agreement states the future partnership will be build on the single customs territory provided for in the withdrawal agreement.                \u0027She hasn\u0027t got the numbers\u0027 Parliamentary arithmatic will DOOM May                What did Theresa May say in Brexit speech TODAY?The withdrawal agreement states: Having regard to the Union and to the United Kingdom\u0027s common objective of a close future relationship, which will establish ambitious customs arrangements that build on the single customs territory provided for in this Protocol, in full respect of their respective legal orders.Mr Barnier stressed that it is not in the EU\u0026rsquos interest to allow the backstop, which would lock Britain in a customs union with the bloc, to be used at all but insisted it should remain in the withdrawal deal.He said the backstop is \u0026ldquonot meant to be used and the UK and EU\u0027s objective is to reach a permanent solution before the end of the 21-month transition period.In July 2020, both sides will hold a joint review of the position before making one of three choices: deciding a trade deal supersedes the need for the backstop, a limited extension to the transition period or trigger the backstop.Mr Barnier said: If we are not ready by July 2020 we could jointly consider extending the transition to provide for more time.\u0026nbspOnly if at the end of the transition extended or not we are still not there with the future agreement would the backstop solution kick in.\u0026nbspThis backstop solution has evolved considerably from the original EU proposal.Brexiteers will once again be left infuriated by the lack of an independent review clause, which will allow the UK to unilaterally quit the backstop.The backstop will only able to be ended \u0026ldquojointly by both sides and will apply until that moment is reached.The withdrawal agreement reads: \u0026ldquoIf at any time after the end of the transition period the Union or the United Kingdom considers that this protocol is, in whole or in part, no longer necessary to achieve the objectives set out in Article1(3) and should cease to apply, in whole or in part, it may notify the other party, setting out its reasons.\u0026ldquoWithin six months of such a notification, the joint committee shall meet at ministerial level to consider the notification, having regard to all of the objectives specific in Article 1. The joint committeemen may seek an opinion from institutions created by the 1998 Agreement.\u0026ldquoIf, following the consideration referred to above, and acting in full respect of Article 5 of the withdrawal agreement, the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly within the joint committee that the protocol, in the whole or in part, is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives, the protocol shall cease to apply, in whole or in part.Both sides have agreed to uphold the withdrawal agreement in good faith, which means either the UK and EU can make suitable challenges to one another if they feel their side of the bargain is not being upheld.

Fishing chiefs have raised concerns with the text within the \u0026lsquopolitical declaration on the future relationship\u0026rsquo and warned they could be forced into a deal similar to that of the Common Fisheries Policy. Fishermen in the UK already feel they have been deeply let down by the Government after the announcement of the implementation period effectively kept the industry under the control of the EU\u0026rsquos controversial Common Fisheries Policy until 2020. But, the text in the \u0027political declaration on the future relationship\u0027 suggests that while Britain will be an \u0026ldquoindependent coastal state, future cooperation on the development of measures \u0026ldquofor the conservation, rational management and regulation of fisheries will be done in a \u0026ldquonon-discriminatory manner.Fishing for Leave told Express they were, while still studying the \u0026ldquoexact meaning of the opaque language in the Brexit text, worried it looked \u0026ldquodeeply suspicious.A Fishing for Leave spokesman said: \u0026ldquoA lot of the wording used is disconcertingly similar to the regulations and treaties founding the CFP, in particular, the\u0026nbspnon-discrimination\u0026nbspprinciple, which in effect means equal access to a common resource.\u0026ldquoWe may officially \u0026lsquoleave\u0026rsquo but, in effect, this new deal and new legal agreement may be different wording, but will create the same effect as a Common Fisheries Policy.\u0026ldquoIt may not be called that, but, if it walks like a Common Fisheries Policy, and quacks like a Common Fisheries Policy, it is a Common Fisheries Policy.Fishing for Leave spokesmanThe political declaration on the future relationship sets out the \u0026ldquoframework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as agreed at negotiators\u0027 level on 14 November 2018.Focusing on \u0026ldquofishing opportunities, the document reads: \u0026ldquoCooperation bilaterally and internationally to ensure fishing at sustainable levels, promote resource conservation, and foster a clean, healthy and productive marine environment, noting that the United Kingdom will be an independent coastal state.\u0026ldquoWhile preserving regulatory autonomy, cooperation on the development of measures for the conservation, rational management and regulation of fisheries, in a non-discriminatory manner.

Negotiations over trade terms for seafood products would follow on from this. Any linkage between access and trade contravenes all international norms and practice and is simply unacceptable in principle.\u0026ldquoTherefore we have asked the Prime Minister for assurances that the establishment of a new fisheries agreement as laid out in the Brexit arrangements does not imply that EU vessels will be guaranteed continued access to our waters in return for favourable trade terms.On Wednesday the cabinet\u0026nbspwere\u0026nbsplocked in discussions for around five hours before the Prime Minister emerged and stood on the steps of 10 Downing Street to announce she had the backing of her team on the future relationship.Mrs May said: \u0026ldquoThe Cabinet has just had a long, detailed, and impassioned debate on the draft withdrawal agreement and the outlined political declaration on our future relationship with the European Union.\u0026ldquoThese documents were the result of thousands of hours of hard negotiations by UK officials and many, many meetings which I and ministers held with our EU counterparts.\u0026ldquoI firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement was the best that could be negotiated.

Long-term weather forecast: \u0026lsquoRECORD COLD\u0026rsquo temperatures on wayMet Office forecaster Alex Deakin said Britons can expect temperatures to drop starting from the weekend \u0026ndash when an area of high pressure is set to usher in cold winds from Eastern Europe.Mr Deaking said: By the time we get to the weekend, again, a subtle shift in the wind. Still, the high pressure dominating, keeping the weather front at bay but as the high shift further north, the winds, instead of coming right from the south, start coming more from the east.That means it may well turn a bit colder as we go through the weekend. Still, the high pressure keeping things dry for most but perhaps turning a little bit cold.The Met Office meteorologist however added most of the country will be able to still bask in milder temperatures in the run-up to the weekend.UK Weather: Met Office has warned a cold front building in Eastern Europe will hit Britain next week (Image: MET OFFICE)He continued: By the time we get to Friday that weather front in the northwest has fizzled out. A huge area of high pressure across northern Europe, a huge area of low pressure in the mid-Atlantic and the UK is stuck in between.The high pressure though generally winning out, with the winds going round, the higher pressure coming up from the south will bring mild air. Again, it will be predominantly cloudy, misty, murky \u0026ndash particularly early on \u0026ndash but with winds coming up from the south, if you are to the north of the hills \u0026ndash north Wales, parts of northern Scotland \u0026ndash you\u0026rsquore likely to see some sunshine which will really lift the temperatures.Even if it stays cloudy, we\u0026rsquore looking at 13-14 degrees.

The forecast read: \u0026ldquoShowers may affect eastern and some central areas and these could turn wintry over hills. It will be cold, especially in the south, with this accentuated by the brisk wind.\u0026ldquoNight frosts are likely and could become widespread at times. Although many places should stay dry, some showers or even longer spells of rain could affect some southern and central areas, perhaps with hill snow.\u0026ldquoSimilar conditions will probably continue into the following weekend and the last week of November although it could become more unsettled from the west or south.\u0026ldquoThere\u0027s also a small chance that wintry showers may develop more widely across northern and eastern areas for a time.The forecast added: \u0026ldquoThere will be an increasing chance of some more unsettled interludes developing, with showers or longer spells of rain spreading to many areas at times.\u0026ldquoTemperatures are likely to be below average overall, with a greater incidence of frosts than usual and any milder interludes likely to be short-lived.\u0026ldquoWith more generally colder temperatures, there will be an increased chance of snow during spells of unsettled weather, especially for the north.

including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby. Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired in , costing the party its Commons majority.Critics in her own party are circling over her handling of Brexit, with rumours more than  MPs have sent letters of no confidence.She could be forced out MPs demand her exit and she loses a subsequent vote.There would then be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to her government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.There could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20180910_130230.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brit trying to claim universal credit told he must take his first day off at his new job to go to a job hunting meeting","story":"Geraint Jones, , who lives in Reading, has been trying to get help on the new benefits system after he lost his job earlier this year.He’s managed to find a new one and is due to start in a couple of weeks, but has bizarrely been told he must attend a mandatory job-hunting meeting at his local job centre anyway, or he won’t be entitled to a penny.The IT sales worker, who has also served in the RAF, told The Sun Online: “They said I still need to come in and meet a job coach.“I’m away for a few days visiting my elderly mum so they told me to take my first day off at my new job - to help me get a job!“It’s just ridiculous.”Geraint, known to pals as Taff, fears he will go into debt as a result of being unable to get help on Universal Credit during the days he’s out of work.He was trying to claim the Jobseekers’ Allowance and Housing Benefit parts of Universal Credit - just to help him for  days when he was between jobs.He waited until his final pay cheque had come through from his old job - another trap that many other claimants can fall into - to make sure his benefit wouldn’t be affected.And after spending weeks hunting, he was delighted to find a new job.But Taff’s pay will likely outweigh any benefits he could get anyway, meaning he won’t be able to get any help for the time he’s been out of work.“I’m quite worried about the next few weeks,” he said.“They say the system encourages people to work as quickly as possible but it’s in my financial interest to not start work until next month so I’ll be entitled to benefits.“It seems designed to do as much as they can not to pay out.“I’m just an ordinary people in a bit of a bad situation and just want some help to get me through.“I served in the forces, I want my little bit back that I’m entitled to.”Now Taff thinks hell not be able to claim the £ to help with his housing and bills, that Universal Credit staff thought he could be entitled to.Taffs just one of many who have had problems on the new system, which many say has pushed them into debt.But officials said it was too late now to half the whole process - even though millions of Brits have been affected by the problems.The Chancellor revealed a new funding boost which will help Brits on the new scheme, but it wont kick in for millions until at least next April.The DWP say any new claimant needs to attend a job centre interview to discuss what they need to do to find work - and whether they are entitled to cash help when they are in it.A spokesperson said: When applying for Universal Credit, people will be asked to meet with their Work Coach to agree a Claimant Commitment.If they already have a job this commitment might include ways to progress in work and increase their pay, rather than looking for work.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003730276661-e1541888658682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp lives in social housing","story":"Shadow development secretary Kate Osamor has faced intense criticism after it emerged that she promoted her son in his House of Commons job, regardless of his conviction for having £, of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bestival in Dorset last year.Now the Sun on Sunday can reveal that Ms Osamor and her son Ishmael, , are living in social housing in Tottenham, north London -

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though.

Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It should include common development of arms industry, she said as well as an EU-wide arms export policy and crucially a European intervention force.It came a day after a senior minister from the French Government called for the EU to become a powerful new “empire” to rival the US and China in an interview which will infuriate Donald Trump.Merkels remarks today in the EU parliament drew loud applause in the legislature but also boos from euro-sceptic members.One of them was chief Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who said: Its a European Union that we are told is now to become an empire - a militarised European Union.A European Union that has launched a new Cold against the United States of America.One hundreds years on from the Armistice we should genuinely be worried.The idea that this new militarised union is somehow a recipe for peace I suggest you sit back and think a little bit more carefully.Maybe you should all re-read history because the European project was set up to stop German domination and what you have seen today is a naked take-over bid.Yesterday French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Europe must be strong enough to defend itself in the future - words the US president called insulting.Le Maire controversial calls for a new superstate came as he backed Macron’s and Merkels plan for a “real European army”.Le Maire suggested Brussels should go one even further and establish itself as an “empire”.Its about Europe having to become a kind of Empire, as China is. And how the US is, the French finance minister told the German newspaper Handelsblatt.After being quizzed by the newspaper on his comments, he added: “Do not get me wrong, Im talking about a peaceful empire thats a constitutional state.I use the term to raise awareness that the world of tomorrow will be about power.Power will make a dference: technological power, economic, financial, monetary, cultural power will be crucial.Trump has blasted Macrons idea for the European Union to build an army to protect itself from the US as insulting.The US President tweeted: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidises greatly!It comes three days after the French President said the US is as big a threat to the EU as Russia and China and called for a “true European army” to defend the bloc.In an extraordinary attack on the US president, Macron lumped Washington together with Moscow and Beijing as Europe’s biggest foes.The arch euro federalist insisted only a fully fledged EU defence force can protect the continent against the trio’s aggression.He said: “We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.“We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.”The French president lashed Mr Trump for deciding to pull the US out of a nuclear treaty with Russia that was signed during the Cold War.He raged: “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim  Europe and its security.”Mr Macron made the comments in a radio interview from the town of Verdun - the site of a major WW battle - as he tours the Western Front ahead of Remembrance Day.They were welcomed by the EU Commission, which said it has already put the wheels in motion for the eventual creation of a euro army.A spokesman beamed: “If there is a Commission that has put forward the need for a meaningful defence identity for the EU, it’s this Commission.“President Macron has been consistently putting forward this narrative for a stronger Europe that empowers and protects.“This is totally totally compatible with our work and all contributions from our EU leaders, and especially from President Macron, are very much welcome.”But the remarks were savaged by former British Army commanders, who said the revelations showed why the UK must pull out of the EU’s defence plans.Major General Julian Thompson, who led British forces in the Falklands, told The Sun: “The EU Commission now openly admits it has created the preamble to an EU army.The UK is in that preamble and risks being kept in it.“Ministers must withdraw or risk losing forever whole chunks of the UK’s democratic control over defence.”Colonel Richard Kemp, a commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added: “This is precisely what eurosceptics have been warning about.“It is time for ministers now to take notice and rein in what they have agreed since the referendum.They have been led astray in the most crucial area of sovereignty.”And Tory MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, a former British Army Brigadier, raged: “Instead of th century dreams of French-led European grandeur, President Macron should be helping build Western solidarity.“That means helping and not obstructing a strong partnership with Britain and strengthening the NATO alliance.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000248408276.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits wont need a visa to travel to europe even if we get a no deal brexit eu confirms","story":"UK citizens will be able to visit the EU for up to three months at a time without having to get new documents -

costing £,with her partner months ago - flagging her nut allergy immediately.The young woman, of Saint Albans, Herts, said she was then given a form for her doctor to sign that would guarantee crew would not serve peanuts to the passengers in her cabin.But she said her doctor took issue with one of the paragraphs in the statement, which reads: “The passenger’s peanut and or other nut allergy condition do not pose any serious risks to his her health given the conditions inflight as stated in attached.”She explained: “It says that there would be no risk of me having an allergic reaction.“But I’m still at risk, there’s always a risk.”The young woman said she had even started wheezing while on a train and sitting next to someone eating peanuts - showing just how deadly the food could be for her.Sophie then provided a statement from her doctor confirming her peanut and nut allergy – but was told last week by the airline it wasn’t enough.The marketing worker said: “I provided this for proof – why they need proof I just don’t know.“Even though they know I have a peanut allergy, they are still going to serve peanuts as a cocktail snack.“I don’t know what  I can do.”Anaphylactic shock is a severe and potentially fatal reaction to a trigger such as an allergy.It normally comes on suddenly, and gets worse very quickly.Symptoms include:A sufferer may also display symptoms of allergies, such as an itchy raised rash , feeling or being sick, swelling or stomach pain.Cases of anaphylaxis can be fatal - like in the case of Megan Lee, who an inquest heard likely died of an anaphylactic shock after eating a meal from the mice-infected Royal Spice takeaway in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire.It comes after -year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died from an allergic reaction while flying with British Airways.The young woman had eaten a baguette from Pret A Manger that had not sufficiently labelled there were sesame seeds inside the sandwich.Sophie said Cathay Pacic yesterday gave her a second medical clearance form about .pm – and told her they needed it ed by the end of the day.Sophie then tried to get a doctor to look over the form but was told the timeline would be impossible.The young woman said she was now desperately trying to get the form signed today – and still didn’t knowshe would fly tomorrow.She said: “The anxiety it is causing – I just don’t know.“I was in tears all day yesterday, I’ve never been put in this position before.“It’s just terrying for me to be sat with everyone eating peanuts.”Cathay Pacic told her to delay her flight, but she said the trip was for a family wedding.She said: “I know it sounds silly – I paid a huge amount of money for this flight and the holiday.“It’s a hell of a lot to throw away because they won’t do this small thing.“At the moment, I literally don’t know what to think.”Cathay Pacic said: “Our team has been trying our best to assist her.”The Sun Online has contacted them for further comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449365690.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"abu bakr al baghdadi search syria hajin","story":"The Sun Online was alongside the battle-hardened warriors as they targeted the warlords henchmen and family in their stronghold of Hajin, east Syria - near where al-Baghdadi is thought to be hiding out.The operation comes just weeks after the so-called Invisible Sheikh ordered the execution of  of his followers for disloyalty from his secret bolthole, which is said to be close to the Iraqi border.“In other battles, the jihadists had other places to run to, but in Hajin they have nowhere to go,” said Commander Havel Ronnie Walat of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which has been fighting ISIS since .“ here it is only the true believers left and they will fight to the death,” he chillingly added.The father of two - who has fought ISIS in Raqqa and Manbij - believes that those Islamic extremists currently left in Hajin includes, mostnot all of ISIS top leadership.In addition to al-Baghdadis relatives many of those still in the area are thought to be the most dedicated of the foreign fighters.“About two months ago we captured this British doctor. He was trying to get to escape to Turkey,” recalls Havel Ronnie.But here is signicant numbers of other foreigners here too - not just British – but many of the top leadership, who are Saudi, Chechen or Iraqi.”ISISs so-called caliphate has been left virtually decimated since they lost their de-facto capital, Raqqa, in Syria last year.However, according to the Havel Ronnie in and around Hajin the bloodthirsty group still control around  square kilometers of villages spotted along the Euphrates river and dislodging them will be extremely dficult.“ISIS have had over five years to prepare, and they have built tunnels and placed IED everywhere… they also know the terrain very well,” he states.“It is very slow work [and] we are having to take it, house by house, metre by metre.”The American-backed coalition recently suffered a major setback last month after the extremists launched a series of counter attacks using the cover of sandstorms.“The sandstorm lasted for almost three days and we could only see meters in front of us,” a female commander explains of that attack.Luckily they suffered no losses at that base, but it was almost over run by the jihadists.Some of those involved in the assault were also foreign fighters.“We captured a Saudi and Afghani…and my [female] comrade shot a blonde European man in the head,” she states pointing near to the ISIS vehicle, where it happened.“He was about to enter our base and explode his suicide vest.”The SDF have recently redeployed some of their elite ‘counter terrorism units to Hajin to bolster their troops in the area.“We will begin the offensive against Hajin soon...but I don’t think this battle will be done quickly” the chief commander explains.“This is not a war that can be won quickly,” he added.Eventhe jihadists do lose Hajin this commander does not believe it will be the end of the terror group.“I am certain that they will be defeated here, but, that will not be the end of ISIS... and what may come after maybe worse, he adds.According to him this is a generational battle which cannot be defeated just by retaking territory.“At least now we and you know where ISIS is but after they are gone, they could attack from anywhere, even in Europe,” he says.In August Baghdadi urged his followers to unleash suicide bombs in the West, just days after he was reported to be brain dead.In the recorded message the worlds most wanted man urged fanatics to follow the striking lions behind recent lone wolf attacks in Europe and Canada."},{"url":null,"title":"you had one job images photos","story":"Even something as simple as labelling a tin of butter correctly has been made a hash of and the people responsible for these hilarious snaps certainly wont be getting a promotion anytime soon.Sometimes the solutions to our everyday problems are so simple that we fail to see it when the answer is staring us right in the face.But even then, some problems can be too hard to deal with for some people.This hall of shame includes everything from grammar mistakes to other-worldly concepts.The outrageous gallery will have you chuckling at some of the funny ways people have mucked up a very simple job."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449416601.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"obese children given electric bikes conwy county","story":"Conwy Council in North Wales says it wants to help kids with weight management dficulties engage in sport.A pilot scheme involving  local youngsters last year showed overweight children struggled to ride up hills using normal bicycles.And leisure chiefs say the motorised bikes - which use batteries to ease pedalling - will help fat children move around dficult terrain.A report found that a third of all schoolchildren in the borough are overweight.The council was asked to match £, in private funding to pay for five so-called e-bikes after a pilot scheme with a local school.If successful, the cash will be provided by EU funding.The council report said: Having run a pilot scheme on a smaller scale within a local school using traditional bicycles, the evidence was clear that e-bikes can help those with weight management dficulties to engage in sport.Using the bike as a tool to experience the outdoors without the e-bike would not have the ability to ride up hills thus making it more accessible and enjoyable.Other benefits include less time on video games and social media s.Long term goals include making the transition on to traditional cycling and long lasting health benefits including a lower body mass index.But locals say the scheme is another example of council jobsworths wasting taxpayers cash.Bin collections in the area are down to just once a month — while councillors signed off on £million rent commitment on its new headquarters.And despite reduced services, council taxes rose by  per cent this year.Local resident Mair Dempster-Jones, said of the bike plan: Tax payers paying for this nonsense again.

This is a decision that will come under intense scrutiny and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable.She concluded: I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions in the national interest.I firmly believe with my head and my heart this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449288384.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mechanic girlfriend ring greggs bake","story":"Mechanic Tony Brown, , got down on one knee in Newcastle city centre between Greggs and department store Fenwick.And when Rebecca, , said yes, they celebrated with a pie.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off. Threatening to kill anyone who supports her.We should give the poor woman asylum in our country, away from the Islamist savages in Pakistan.But the Government fears “reprisal” attacks by the extremists.That’s a gutless response and devoid of ­principle.Give Asia Bibi a home here. We’ll deal with the savagesthey try ­anything on.We’re getting used to it, after all.I’M trying to work out which of the Remoaners I dislike more. Gary Lineker or Tony Blair.I suppose Gary didn’t illegally invade a sovereign country.But then Blair never sported a stupid goatee beard or spent half of his le selling crisps.Although I daresay he would have donethere’d been enough dosh in it.Lineker, like many other remoaners, was demanding a second vote on Brexit.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is a decision that will come under intense scrutiny and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable.She concluded: I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions in the national interest.I firmly believe with my head and my heart this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.Mrs May insisted that blocking her deal would mean going back to square one, with more ision and more uncertainty.And she promised to present the deal to Parliament tomorrow morning in a formal Commons statement.A number of pro-Brexit ministers were previously feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.The main point of contention is the Irish backstop - a mechanism which will keep the borderthe two sides fail to strike a comprehensive trade deal in time.Arlene Foster is expected to have warned Mrs May that the DUP could pull the plug on the deal which sees them prop her up in power.Senior unionist Sammy Wilson blasted: We fought against a terrorist campaign to stay within the UK, were not going to let the EU break Northern Ireland just as we didnt let the IRA do so.IRISH BACKSTOPBRITAIN will be able to try get out of the controversial customs backstop after six months - but onlythe EU or an independent  sign it off.In a move that infuriated Brexiteers, the draft withdrawal agreement contained no fix date or “unilateral” way for the UK to collapse the controversial insurance measure that will keep Britain locked to Brussels trade rules for years.But in a win for Britain, the insurance option will be UK-wide rather than simply keeping Northern Ireland bound to Brussels.It reads: Until the future relationship becomes applicable, a single customs territory between the EU and the UK shall be established.Before the backstop kicks in, an option to extend the -month transition period can be discussed by both parties in July .But once it kicks in, either side have to give six months notice to bring it to an end - andboth sides do not agree a new trade deal keeps the Northern Irish border open, then a five-strong  of judges and experts will be called in.CITIZENS RIGHTSTHE Brexit agreement guarantees residence and social security rights to an estimated .million EU nationals living in the UK.And Brussels is thought to have made a similar pledge to the .million or so British expats living on the Continent.Theresa May had already declared that any EU citizen living in the UK could apply for Settled Status in Brexit Britain right up until the end of the transition phase on New Year’s Eve in .Those who arrive before  can have temporary leave to remain while they build up the five years they need to apply for Settled Status.Under the plans, the EU nationals will also have a “letime right” to bring their spouse, their parents and grandparents to the UK at any point.EU nationals can also bring in girlfriends or boyfriendsthey can prove they have been a “durable partner” for two years.Britain had already controversially conceded it would follow EU case law in the run up to Brexit on any legal cases regarding EU nationals.And it will take account of the views of the European Court of Justiceon citizens’ rights for up to eight years afterwards.DIVORCE BILLSOME £billion of taxpayers’ cash will be handed over to Brussels in a ‘Financial Settlement’ agreed by Theresa May and her negotiating team.Under the terms of the ‘Divorce Bill’, Britain will initially pay around £billion – reflecting the EU membership fees for the post-Brexit transition phase next year and .The remainder is made up of obligations and legal commitments from the UK’s -year membership - such as part-funding Eurocrat officials’ pensions.Under last night’s deal the EU will update the UK’s outstanding obligations by March  of each year – starting from .Any missed payments will accrue interest.Inthe UK will get cash back for its assets – such as its share of the European Investment Bank.EURO JUDGESEUROPEAN judges will have the ultimate say on most disputes relating to the Withdrawal Agreement - making it one of the most contentious parts of the document.A Joint Committee will be set up by the end of the transition period - comprising of two judges from each of the UK and EU and a fth independent.It will aim to resolve all disputes butno mutually agreed solution is agreed on any inidual dispute within three months then an arbitration  will be set up to make a final decision.But any dispute that involves a “concept” of EU law will go straight to the European Court of Justice to give a ruling on the question.This will trigger fears that all contentious decisions will ultimately be ruled upon by European judges - because most of the withdrawal agreement could be interpreted to involve “a concept of union law” and therefore be deferred to the ECJ.Within minutes of Mrs May revealing the deal had made it through the Cabinet, Jacob Rees-Mogg called on Brexiteer MPs to vote against it when it comes to the Commons.He wrote in an open letter: The proposed agreement will see the UK hand over £billion to the EU for little or nothing in .The deal is unacceptable to unionists, will lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws and is profoundly undemocratic.Mr Rees-Mogg added: For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in Parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.Mark Francois, a senior member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, warned Mrs May the deal could bring her time in office to an end.He blasted: A lot of colleagues are very unhappy with this deal. I would rule nothing out.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns said she was dismayed and disgusted, adding: The only way to save Brexit is a new leader.Nadine Dorries said: The Cabinet backing this deal is the quickest route to a leadership election.And Nigel Farage tweeted: Any cabinet member who is a genuine Brexiteer must now resign or never be trusted again, this is the worst deal in history.But Eurocrats tonight spoke out in support of the deal and said it provided enough progress for the ongoing talks to move to the next stage - with a summit of European leaders taking place within a couple of weeks.Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was a decisive crucial step in concluding these negotiations.He claimed the deal would lead to an ambitious partnership, which we want, which is a free trade area based on regulatory and customs co-operation, in depth and with a level playing field.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, wrote to European Council boss Donald Tusk officially recommending that the next stage should be triggered.He said: I look forward to our continued good co-operation with a view to bringing this important matter to a successful conclusion.During Prime Ministers Questions this afternoon, the PM was assailed from all sides over her Brexit plans.Jeremy Corbyn blasted: After two years of bungled negotiations, from what we know of the Governments deal its a failure in its own terms.Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone told Mrs May: You are not delivering the Brexit people voted for and today you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.And Ken Clarke called on her to put Parliament first by keeping MPs in the loop - instead of hatching agreements behind closed doors.Last night Cabinet ministers were called into Downing Street one by one to examine the details of the agreement.TOMORROW: Theresa May makes statement in the House of Commons in her first attempt to win the backing of MPs as a wholeNEXT FEW DAYS: EU diplomats study the text of the deal and flag up any problemsLATE NOVEMBER OR EARLY DECEMBER: EU leaders attend an emergency summit in Brussels, probably on November , where all  heads of government will sign off on the treatyBEFORE CHRISTMAS: Parliament votes on the withdrawal agreement -

It’s swapped vassalage for slavery.”Last night it appeared Theresa May had chucked elements of her controversial Chequers deal to get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line.Under the Chequers plan, the Government had argued for a single Common Rulebook for laws on a future trade deal.But last night a senior Government source refused to sayshe was still pushing for it, saying: “We may get frictionless trade through another way.”It could open the door for the UK to pursue a Canada-style free trade, championed by Boris Johnson.The major climbdown by No emerged when London and Brussels published a political declaration setting out an outline of a future trading relationship alongside the orce deal.Despite only being seven pages long, it spelt out a joint aspiration for the UK-EU’s future economic relationship.The draft agreement will now be the subject of intense negotiation over the next ten days before it is forecast to get the nod at an expected emergency EU summit on Sunday November .It sets ambitious goals for zero tarfs, no fees and no charges for all goods moving between the EU and the UK.On citizens and tourists, it proposes visa-free travel for short-term visits for Brits visiting Europe and Europeans coming to the UK.The draft agreement proposes a new fisheries deal.It also covers agreements in transport and energy, and says the future relationship would also cover justice, security and foreign policy co-operation.The whole document is based on the EU’s concept of the closer the cooperation and the more sovereignty is pooled, the better the access to Europe’s single market.Brexiteers have campaigned for years to free Britain from the stranglehold of the European Court of Justice.But the Withdrawal Document makes  references to the future role of the hated ECJ.Downing Street will have to give six months’ notice that it wants to walk away from the backstop.The request would go before a joint committee made up of two UK judges, two from the EU and one independent trade expert.If the two sides cannot agree on who the independent trade expert should be, they could “draw lots”.The Withdrawal Agreement confirms Britain will have to pay an estimated £billion “orce bill”. It reflects almost all of the detail of a deal outlined in principle a year ago when Theresa May made a pre-dawn dash to Brussels.The UK will as expected give letime residency to an estimated . million EU citizens currently living here.Their close family members will also be given the opportunity to have ‘Settled Status’ in Brexit Britain.Some . million British expats will be given the similar commitment on the Continent.Britain saw off a bid by Madrid and Brussels to use Brexit to open up fresh questions about Gibraltar’s sovereignty.Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “We urge all politicians to think long and hard about how they react to this first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for business, workers and consumers.”SOME £billion of taxpayers’ cash will be handed over to Brussels in a financial settlement agreed by Theresa May and her negotiating team.Britain will initially pay around £billion — reflecting EU membership fees for the post-Brexit transition phase next year and in .The rest is made up of obligations and legal commitments from the UK’s -year membership such as part-funding Eurocrat officials’ pensions.Under last night’s deal, the EU will update the UK’s outstanding obligations by March  of each year starting from .Any missed payments will accrue interest. The UK will get cash back for its “assets” which include its share of the European Investment Bank.The Treasury’s independent forecaster had claimed payments could last all the way up to  with £.billion handed over in , £billion in  and £.billion in .Britain will not pay relocation costs of two EU agencies — the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority which will leave the UK for the Continent.THE BREXIT agreement guarantees residence and social security rights to an estimated .million EU nationals living in the UK.And Brussels is thought to have made a similar pledge to the .million or so British expats living on the Continent. Theresa May had already declared that any EU citizen living in the UK could apply for “Settled Status” in Brexit Britain right up until the end of the “transition phase” on New Year’s Eve in . Those who arrive before  can have temporary leave to remain while they build up the five years they need for Settled Status.Under the plans, those EU nationals will also have a “letime right” to bring their spouse, their parents and grandparents to the UK at any point.EU nationals can also bring in girlfriends or boyfriendsthey can prove they have been a “durable partner” for two years.Britain had already controversially conceded it would follow EU case law in the run-up to Brexit on any legal cases regarding EU nationals.EUROPEAN judges will have the ultimate say on most disputes relating to the Withdrawal Agreement — making it one of the most contentious parts.A Joint Committee will be set up by the end of the transition period — comprising of two judges from each of the UK and EU and a fth independent.It will aim to resolve all disputes butno solution is agreed on any dispute in three months then an arbitration  will be set up to decide.But any dispute that involves a concept of EU law will go straight to the European Court of Justice to give a ruling on the question.This will trigger fears that all contentious decisions will be ruled upon by European judges — because most of the Withdrawal Agreement could be interpreted to involve “a concept of union law”.The arbitration  that will resolve disputes that are not deemed to involve EU law will be made up of five judges.These will be drawn from a list of  judges.The UK and EU will nominate  each, with the remaining five independent.THERESA May last night abandoned her bitterly criticised Chequers plan for a future trade deal to agree a “free trade area” for goods instead.The major climbdown by No emerged when London and Brussels published a political declaration setting out an outline of a future trading relationship.At seven pages long, it spelt out a joint aspiration for the UK-EU’s future economic relationship.It suggests the deal is neither the Canada-style option favoured by the hardline Brexiteers nor the closer Norway model of single-market alignment.It will be “a free-trade area combining deep regulatory and customs co-operation”.It sets ambitious goals for zero tarfs, no fees and no charges for all goods moving between the EU and the UK.Alongside this are proposals for a “level playing field” on social, employment and environment standards in order to keep trade as frictionless and smooth as possible.It proposes a new fisheries deal governing access to each other’s waters and quota shares.THE controversial “backstop” insurance plan will only kick in after December the EU and UK decide not to extend the transition phase.In July , both sides can chose to extend the exit process one time only.The draft withdrawal agreement contained no fix date or “unilateral” way for the UK to collapse the controversial insurance measure that will keep the UK locked to Brussels trade rules for years.Once it kicks in, either side must give six months notice to end it by mutual agreement.If both sides do not agree a new trade deal that keeps the Northern Irish border open, then a five-strong  of judges and experts will be called in.We can appeal to an independent  to rule on whether Brussels is trying to trap the UK inside a never-ending customs union.However the UK will sign up to “level playing field rules” to stop us getting an economic advantage over the EU by cutting rules or taxes.BRITAIN saw off an attempt by Madrid and Brussels to use Brexit to open up further questions about the sovereignty of Gibraltar.The Rock is covered by exactly the same orce terms as the UK mainland.But a decision on whether to let the Spanish share the access to Gibraltar airport has been kicked into the long grass.Also Brexit questions over keeping our RAF bases in Cyprus have also been put to bed.Brussels raised the possibility of hiving off Gibraltar and possibly excluding it from any transition phase because of its border with Spain.But the withdrawal agreement makes clear this is not the case and any mention of the UK also covers the territory.There will however be joint committees set up between the UK, Spain and Gibraltarian governments to tackle smuggling of petrol and alcohol over the border after Brexit.And there will also be joint measures to tackle money-laundering and tax avoidance. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A total of  per cent of young women say they have missed at least one day of school because they didnt have adequate sanitary protection, and some have missed more.He continued: Well work with schools and colleges so they dont need to miss school.As a council, this in our power to address. And it was about time, in terms of equality, to discuss these matters in public.In Bristol, Councillor Helen Godwin, who lobbied for the motion, said: This issue simply shouldnt belong in  and it is a travesty that we need to tackle period poverty in our city. Too many of our girls and women are unable to afford or access sanitary protection during their period.Godwin said she wants Bristol to be a trailblazer local authority in how they tackle the issue and will hold a period poverty summit next month to map out how to ensure that all girls in Bristol for Year Five to  can access pads and tampons in their school.She said they will also pledge to ensure that free sanitary products will be available from libraries and civic buildings, as well as encouraging local businesses to provide products to their workforce.It is my hope then that women and girls will never have to consider whether they can afford to have their period, she said.Charity Plan International UK has found that one in  girls aged  to  have been unable to afford sanitary products.A total of  per cent have had to improvise sanitary wear and  per cent of girls have changed to a less suitable sanitary product due to cost.Lucy Russell, Plan International UKs Campaign Manager, said: We welcome proposals and new ideas to help tackle the fact that for too many girls, dealing with their period each month is proving a tough challenge. Distributing products at school, including reusables, could play a role in ensuring that no girl struggles to afford sanitary wear.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/denise.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=686\" height=\"960","title":"james bulger mum denise fergus blasts channel 5 documentary","story":"The two schoolboys - then aged -years-old - abducted and mutilated little James while he was out shopping with Denise Fergus.James Bulger: The New Revelations aired this evening on Channel  and Denise tweeted her disgust at the show.She wrote: Ive had to watch the disgusting @channel_tv @caravan__media documentary, to know what Im having to deal with.I can honestly say Im upset, fuming with the  sided sympathy with the evil killers of my beautul son who was only  yrs old when they abducted  murdered him.The Channel  show claim it would present startling new evidence about the case.The documentary explored the home le of both Venables and Thompson, who was described by experts as an urban feral child.He revealed in his parole statement his dad would beat his mum in front of his family and said he would stay out for as long as he could to avoid going home.The killer claimed his dad once made him strip naked when chocolates vanished from the Christmas tree one year and threatened to chop his penis off with scissors.Experts claimed his home le could have led to his actions and revealed he had a baby brother who looked just like James.One said everything went to the new baby - speculating whether there was connection between a child who had experienced a rejection through the arrival of another child.Viewer supported Denise, with one writing: I am so sorry that you have to go through this again.The should have never have been released  there is nothing to excuse what they did to your gorgeous boy.

She has to overcome three major hurdles - her own Cabinet,  EU leaders, and finally a vote in the House of Commons. At every stage she could be thwarted - especially the last one. MPs are threatening mutiny over the Northern Ireland backstop, a customs backup plan that could leave the UK trapped in Brussels orbit. After months of very little to report things could now move very quickly in a frenetic round of diplomacy. A lot is unknown, but here is the most likely timetable in the weeks and months ahead. Tuesday  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, and  days after the Brexit vote, a deal was finally reached at a technical level between the UK and EU. Wednesday  November: Ministers flooded to an emergency Cabinet meeting from pm that ran for more than four hours to sign off the deal. This was the first of three danger moments for the PM, and ministers were ordered to either back the deal or quit. Thursday  November: Theresa May due to give a statement to Parliament on the -page Brexit deal, allowing MPs to finally question her for the first time.  Sunday  November: This date has been pencilled in for an emergency EU summit with  other leaders to sign off the deal. This will be danger moment number two for the Prime Minister, when she has to face down pro-EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. But its likely shell face more trouble at home than in Brussels, where EU officials have already spent months working out the detail. Thursday  December: The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to agree a deal with the other EU leadersno emergency summit is scheduled. Already its much later than the ideal date, which was meant to be October. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day.  Thursday  December: By this date, there will be a vote in the UK Parliament on the deal. MPs should get a vote on two elements - the withdrawal agreementand the future framework . This is danger moment number three for Theresa May - and by far the worst one. If any of the crunch moments will force her from office, it will be this one. She will almost certainly have to resign or face a vote of no confidence. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  January to March : Dozens of national and regional parliaments across the EU will hold their own votes on the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, No Deal planning has to ramp up in case everything doesnt come together in time.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.   December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. Only at this point will the much-discussed Brexit deal actually kick in. Talk has been floated of extending this date by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal to stop customs checks on the Northern Ireland border, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. What happensa deal is voted down   If MPs do not vote for the PM’s deal then the UK defaults to a no-deal Brexit. Such a scenario could trigger a crisis in the financial markets, plummeting sterling and adding to an unprecedented political crisis. What then  Constitutionally, the Government must decide what happens next. Ministers have to come to Parliament by  January to make a statement setting out their proposals. Will the PM quit or face a leadership challengeshe loses the vote   Few Tory MPs seem happy with Mrs May’s leadership but important factors have somehow managed to keep her in power to date, and they haven’t changed. Tory MPs know they are likely to face voters’ anger and there is no agreed successor. If she resigns it could still be messy. Will there be an election  Theresa May would also have to lose an vote of confidence in the Commons in order for an election to occur. What is the latest stage at which a no-deal Brexit can be reversed   Some argue the only real deadline for a deal is  March . As long as a deal has been struck, and approved by Parliament in a meaningful vote by Brexit day, then Article  can be extended in order for the legislation to be passed. This could mean that evena deal was voted down the first time round it could be put in front of MPs again, possibly early next year.

It’s believed McVey called for a vote to “put on record where everyone stood” but the idea was rebuffed. Sources claim McVey was emotional and aggressive as she argued against the deal. An insider told Thethat McVey had a massive bust-up with May and warned the Government will be voted down when the deal goes to a meaningful vote in Parliament.Warring Tories were left furious at plans for a backstop to keep the Irish border open - by extending EU customs rules across the whole of the UK.That would keep the UK locked in Brussels orbit without a say on its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world.

No sources said all  ministers spoke - and they were all offered a glass of wine afterwards, red or white. A source admitted there were “dficult issues” that were “uncomfortable”.

The Labour leader was handed a piece of paper as he was grilled over a second Brexit referendum. Mr Corbyn answered tough questions from the editors of the Daily Mirror andat a ReachFest event in London, hosted by the Mirrors parent company Reach. At the same time, Theresa May was attempting to convince her Cabinet to support her Brexit draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union. Mr Corbyn was handed the note before he joked with the  saying “it says do not pass go”. He later said he was going to “read this message and see what it says”, placing on his glasses to read the note before turning to the  and joking: “How do you spell resign ”  During the forum, Mr Corbyn, who has come under mounting pressure to support a second poll, dismissed another Brexit vote as not “a priority”. The party leader, who spent  years on the backbenches as a eurosceptic before campaigning for Remain after winning the party leadership in , risked disappointing Labours pro-EU members with his comments. Quizzed about a second referendum, he told guests: “I dont see that as a priority.” As the Prime Minister was engulfed by unprecedented threats to her premiership following a five-hour Cabinet showdown, he insisted Labour was ready for a snap election – and shouldering the responsibility of starting fresh talks with Brussels. “We have to reopen the negotiations quickly,” he vowed. “We would do a better deal.”  Brexit timetable: What happens next now UK finally has a deal with the EU  Challenged over what Labours Brexit policy would be for a general election, he insisted the party would decide. “Its a very democratic party,” he said.“Listen, I am not a dictator.” The Labour chief also revealed his MPs would be whipped to tow the party line in a crunch Commons vote on the Prime Ministers EU orce pact. “We will be voting as a party,” he confirmed. Mr Corbyn was tackled over criticism of Labours “six tests” for backing a Brexit deal from his own Shadow Cabinet. Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner dismissed the tests as “b*******” over the summer. The Labour leader revealed Mr Gardiner had apologised to him.  Mr Corbyn confided: “He said to me he was very sorry for using bad language.” He also used the -minute  debate in Soho, London, to blast the Governments universal credit roll-out and homelessness And discussing plans to revive ailing high streets, he said he “didnt think” he had ever used Amazon for online shopping. “If we all do that kind of shopping our high streets become payday loan companies, coffee shops and very little ,” warned the party chief. He also launched a bid to shore up his support among youngsters, some of whom are angry he has failed to be tougher on the Government over Brexit. “Young people have for too long been told, Youre going to have to pay for your education, you better think about private healthcare, you better think about private pensions and you better be thinking about paying for your education,” he said. “Surely as a society,we want – as we must have – that skilled, educated workforce for the future then we have to invest in education, training and skills.”  Mr Corbyn backed hiking corporation tax from % to % and renewed Labours support for a mass renationalisation programme. “In the case of the water industry they are taking out loans in order to pay shareholders,” he said. “Surely what they should be doing is investing in our water service, not paying out all these idends.” He was also grilled about his feelings on Britains nuclear deterrent. The Labour leader – a veteran Stop the War and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament activist – distanced himself from the policy of the party he leads, which is to renew the Trident submarine system. He said: “I have a whole letime history of being appalled by nuclear weapons and nuclear warfare.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sky news adam boulton swears","story":"NewsSky News Adam Boulton swears on live TV as he covers Brexit talksThe senior journalist swore during a rant about Theresa Mays delayed address on the Brexit dealShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video sky-news-adam-boulton-swears-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSky News editor-at-large Adam Boulton swore live on TV today outside Number  Downing Street in the latest in a series of high-profile gaffes.

The Prime Minister cleared the first hurdle when Cabinet ministers finally approved the draft terms of her agreement with Brussels at a stormy five-hour meeting on Wednesday. But she now faces a battle to get it through Parliament as pro-Leave Conservative MPs - as well as some Remainers - lined up to condemn the plan, accusing her of breaking promises and leaving the UK at the mercy of Brussels.Following the release of the -page agreement document, Jacob Rees-Mogg - the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group - wrote to all Tory MPs urging them to vote against it. Rumours continued to swirl at Westminster that the tally of Conservative MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May is about to reach the  threshold needed to trigger a vote on her position. Mr Rees-Mogg said that he was not among those MPs who had written to the chairman of the Tory backbench  Committee, Sir Graham Brady, but suggested he could be very close to doing so. Certainly this has dented my confidence, he told ITVs Peston programme. Politics depends on trust and this document is shattering to trust.  While the Cabinet agreed to collectively support the agreement, there was speculation that some ministers were so unhappy that they could still quit in protest. Reports suggested as many as a third of the  ministers attending the meeting in No  voiced doubts about the deal.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was said to be particularly upset amid reports she was shouted down after she tried to press for the agreement to be put to a vote. Mrs May described the debate around the Cabinet table as long, detailed and impassioned, in a clear indication her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers. Speaking outside  Downing Street minutes after the meeting concluded, she acknowledged she faced dficult days ahead as she attempts to win round critical MPs. I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom, she said.At the same time she warned Brexiteers thatthey failed to back her plan they risked ending up with no Brexit at all. Chief Whip Julian Smith has said he is confident the Government will get the support of Parliament for the deal.But with the DUP - whose  MPs prop up Mrs May in the Commons - voicing their unhappiness at the agreement, and the prospect of a signicant Tory backbench revolt it is hard to see how ministers can make the numbers add up. Jeremy Corbyn again made clear that Labour was unlikely to come to the Governments rescue.I dont believe that the deal that Ive heard of so far is in the national interest. It doesnt meet the interests of all parts of Britain, it doesnt give us a security of our trading relationship with Europe in the future, he said.  Meanwhile European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker issued a statement that decisive progress had been made, clearing the way for a special summit for leaders of the remaining  EU states to give their stamp of approval, probably on November . Senior UK Government officials said the final text of the withdrawal agreement featured important gains for the UK on the so-called backstop arrangements to be implementedno trade deal can be reached. The outline political declaration - which will be subject to further negotiation over the coming weeks - expresses an ambition to achieve zero tarfs and no quotas in EU-UK trade, something the officials said no other major economy had achieved.

Corbyns accusation that Mays posing a  choice between a botched deal and no deal thats a failure on its own terms following two years of bungled negotiations hurt because its largely true. Picking at sovereignty and trade deal sores, this was the best Prime Ministers Questions performance for months from a Labour leader who mocked her and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabs discovery of the importance of the Dover-Calais route to and from the Continent.  The usual Tory wall of noise behind May was largely quelled and her dig at Labour splits, Corbyn asserting Brexit cant be stopped and Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer insisting it can, lacked sharpness as Corbyn gave himself wriggle room by arguing he wouldnt frustrate it but he would oppose a Tory mess. This is a colossal crisis for Britain and not just May when her effective deputy David Lidington earlier today admitted the Brexit hes supporting would leave the country worse off.

And the groom is captured in the stark landscape, his neatly tailored wedding suit soaked through by sheets of rain lashing the crags. But the results of their bold choice of venue are a series of stunning images that capture both the raw beauty of the wilderness setting and their love for each other.  Newly-weds James and Laura picked the Isle of Skye after considering locations around the globe. James, , and Lisa,  flew from their home in Chicago to the picturesque island for the unique shoot following their Scottish wedding ceremony on September .The couple, who have been together for four years, got in touch with Andrew Rae - a Scottish photographer - on Instagram after viewing his incredible gallery of past images.However, the pair were hit with strong winds and a barrage of mud as they posed for the set.  Lisa said: We anticipated cooler, misty, weather similar to that of the Pacic Northwest in the states. Boy, were we in for a surprise. The wind was unreal. The weather in Chicago fluctuates pretty regularly in spring and fall. We could have a week of F and have snow the next. We have a fair amount of wind that comes off of Lake Michigan, but nothing like the wind in Skye. I’m sure it was F and sunny back home on our wedding day.  Lisa said the couple took a while to decide on their perfect destination to elope but after spotting pictures of the Isle, their mind was made up. Lisa added: We wanted a unique wedding experience that was reflective of us. We both love the outdoors and are always up for an adventure. We were interested in a remote area overseas, the idea just seemed more romantic.  She added: Our first destination thought was French countryside, but the more I researched it, the more dficult it seemed to be due to the language barrier. Scotland continually came up as an elopement destination and neither of us had been before so we just kind of went with it. Photographs of Skye really solidied it as the perfect place for us.  The couple prepared for the weather conditions and Lisa said she didnt mind getting her wedding dress covered in mud. She added: It was expected. I searched for the perfect dress that could pack well and was lightweight for hiking around for this purpose. We wanted to end up in the fairy pools, but due to the weather we never made it. I’ve been dreaming of Skye every day since.  The newlyweds grew up just half a mile away from each other Lisa said: We knew of each other in high school but connected well after college at a neighbourhood bar. We now own a home in the same neighborhood we grew up in.  Lisa said she would recommend a similar shoot to anyone who wants incredible wedding photographs. She added: We planned to marry at Loch Coruisk but could not make the trip due to bad weather. We chose to marry at Honeycomb Rock, an area near the pier to travel to Loch Coruisk. Andrew’s photography skills are truly an art form. I never imagined I would look at such a beautul photograph and see myself in it.  We had such a wonderful experience, everyone was so warm and welcoming. The people really made the trip. For those interested, expect the worst with the weather and embrace it. And please, leave Skye as beautul as you found it.

Since , a small industrial zone near Leeds city centre has become an area where police say there is a “lower likelihood of arrest” for those involved in the sex trade. Leeds councillors yesterday voted to have an independent review into the managed approach, in Holbeck, after calls were made for it to be suspended. The women working in the zone have a dedicated female plain-clothes officer they can turn to for help. And police, who make regular patrols, mostly turn a blind eye to the sex trade. CCTV cameras were put up by the council shortly after the  murder of Polish national Daria Pionko, . But the managed scheme has been slammed by locals. Campaign group Save Our Eyes claims children are in danger, and are witnessing sexual activity and drug taking on a daily basis.  But the sex workers in the city defended the arrangement, saying “it’s keeping us alive” and “feeding our kids”. Cllr Amanda Carter yesterday told the chamber: “The pimps have to be dealt with because [the women] are controlled by these men who are evil.” But Cllr Andrew Scopes told the council: “In , only % of crime was reported – now that rate is %.” The Mirror has spoken to those on both sides of the debate.  You cant stop this trade but its safe for us here Desperate women who say they are forced to sell their bodies after getting caught in a poverty trap are urging the council not to axe the zone. One, a -year-old mum, said: “I’ve got no criminal record and I don’t take drugs. I’ve never stolen anything in my le. But three months ago I lost my professional job of  years and I’ve got nothing to live on. “I’ve got a claim in for benefits but haven’t had a penny. They tell me to be patient, but being patient isn’t going to feed my child or pay my mortgage. “A few months ago I’d only ever slept with seven men, now I’m seeing perverts every night. “I hate it but I’ve got to pay my bills and save my home. This is my secret, my partner thinks I work in a bar. It’s a horrible secret to keep.” But she urged the council and police not to shut the zone down, adding: “This is an industrial area, there’s CCTV and police patrolling all the time. It’s safe for us here. You’re never going to stop this trade, toleration is the key.” A mum-of-two, aged , also claimed a cut in benefit forced her on to the streets. She said: “They took pound a week off me. My kids are nine and one and I need to get school unorm for the eldest. “I didn’t have a good childhood. My kids aren’t going to suffer like I did. What the kids want, they get. “But it has to be paid for. That’s why I’m here. My boyfriend doesn’t know. He thinks I work in a strip bar. He doesn’t agree with it. My first [punter] was really sweet and now I can earn pound a night. I’m good at it. I’ve been out in snow shivering but I made pound, that night because they felt sorry for me.”  Many street workers congregate on Holbeck Lane under the scrutiny of half a dozen CCTV cameras. The area is littered with pink condoms, given to the girls by a local charity. A makesht bed – an old massage table – lies in waste ground nearby surrounded by condoms and human excrement. “They complain about the condoms but don’t provide bins,” said a -year-old, clutching her silver heels to give her aching feet a break. “I bring nappy sacks with me.” She said she had been a sex worker for  years and had entertained some , men at a rate of up to  a night. She said: “We need these cameras to protect us. I’ve got called a slag – I’m not a slag, I get paid for it. “I had six eggs thrown at me the other day and one hit me on the head.” She admits working the streets to feed her crack cocaine habit. A Romanian aged  told how she boosts her pound-a-month factory wage by coming to the zone twice a week. She has been in the UK for five years and said: “I feel safe because of the CCTV cameras and police. There are some men I’m scared of.” Another woman, who is with her, discreetly nods at a middle-aged man in a Volkswagen car who has been parked up watching the girls all night. She said: “He owns half the girls on this street. He supplies them with cocaine and they pay him. He’s got six women under his control. But not me.” Chloe, : I get old men offering me sweets for sex on my way to school A schoolgirl who lives nears the red light zone claims she has been approached about  times by “old men” with one offering her sweets for sex. Chloe Lynch, , said she has been pestered since she was  while walking to and from school in her unorm. She said: “Once I was in a group walking back and a man offered us sweets. “Another time an old man askedI was working and asked me to go in his house.  “It is frightening. Before, I thought prostitute meant some sort of politician. I didn’t even know what one was. But now I know what it means. It’s scary.” Chloe’s mum Gemma, , said locals fear for the safety of their children, who are exposed to sexual activity almost daily. She told how her youngest child, nine-year-old Charis, saw a prostitute injecting a man in his genitals. “We don’t let the kids play out now,” Gemma said. “This managed area was all right at first but now it has spread to residential streets.” Even the local primary school caretaker has been forced to clear up condoms and used syringes every morning, campaigners claim. And recently a grandmother alleged a man approached her as she pushed a pram and sickeningly asked her for an hour alone with the baby. Police said they were investigating this claim. Local shop owner Laura Walton, , said “The managed area has spread – some can’t be bothered to walk down to the zone.  “There’s used condoms and needles all over Holbeck now. The prostitution seems to have moved to the residential areas. “People are seeing them having sex outside their homes, in people’s driveways, phone boxes and around St Matthew’s Church. In the summer it gets worse and we have to prepare ourselves. I had customers in one day with children and a woman lted her skirt up at us. “My friend’s little boy is four and he asked his mum about one woman: ‘She’s not coming back is she, that bad lady ’” Chief Superintendent Steve Cotter said: “We encourage people to report incidents immediately. We recently increased the level of resources we have dedicated to the Managed Approach and we have had some positive feedback about policing of the area. “We will not allow crime or antisocial behaviour to go unchallenged.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains nuclear bomb test legacy","story":"NewsBritains nuclear bomb test legacy of early deaths and deformed childrenThe horric story behind the UKs nuclear experiments have been told in full for the first timeShareCommentsBySusie Bonace:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mirror-been-fighting-justice-medal-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter the horrors of the Second World War, it was deemed necessary for Britain to have a weapon that could unleash hell.

The site takes its name from an editorial written in  by Mirror editor Richard Stott, who thundered: “How many more generations of the damned will our politicians allow to suffer before they accept the calamities of their predecessors and the consequences of their own cowardice ” In May, the Mirror called for an award for the veterans and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has ordered a medal review. DAMNED begins with Operation Hurricane in , when Britain exploded its first atomic bomb, covers the Minor Trials in South Australia, which left the landscape littered with plutonium debris for decades, and reports on Operation Grapple in  when the UK detonated its biggest weapon. It also details the human cost and shows how every other nuclear nation on Earth came to accept and recognise their nuclear heroes – leaving Britain the only one to deny a duty of care. The MoD said: “We are grateful to all those who participated in the British nuclear testing programme which contribute to keeping our country secure and we carefully consider every request to recognise their extraordinary accomplishments. The National Radiological Protection Board has carried out three large studies of nuclear test veterans and found no valid evidence to link participation in these tests to ill health.” DAMNED has a memorial section with the pictures and health problems of every veteran from our archives. Some of their stories can be read here: I was used in a human radiation experiment Bob Malcolmson was an -year-old wireless operator on destroyer HMS Diana in  when he was used in a human radiation experiment. Operation Mosaic saw the ship spend eight hours after each of two blasts in the toxic clouds. Captain John Gower later wrote: “We were required… to deliberately contaminate our ship.” The aim was to seethe vessel could be washed down andthe crew remained operational. Bob left the navy in , but four years later, was diagnosed with polycythemia rubra vera, a condition linked to radiation which makes his bone marrow produce too many red blood cells.

He has had  procedures to remove blood, a heart bypass, glaucoma and cataracts, a deep vein thrombosis, an incurable circulatory condition, four operations to remove skin cancer, eight operations on his leg, two stents and had part of his penis cut out to remove a cancerous tumour.

The -year-old shot dead Fred Barras, , and wounded accomplice Brendon Fearon, , when they burgled his Norfolk farm in . The case ided the nation – with many saying he had the right to defend his home and property. He was convicted of murder and wounding with intent and got a le term in  but the murder rap was downgraded to manslaughter on appeal and he was freed in . Still unrepentant, Mr Martin said he last year visited Barras’s grave for the first time and thought: “Well, boy, this is basically what you wanted.” He also claimed burglars have targeted his now derelict farmhouse, Bleak House, again. And he told of how he believes his standing shyconvictions should now be quashed. Mr Martin will appeal the shyconvictions amid claims new evidence has been found, which casts doubt on original findings in the case.  Asked why he was making the move, he said: “Your home is your castle, it’s about having the courage to be free. I want freedom for people who are decent. I have a right to clear my name – I’m not sure how much longer I’ve got to live.” The appeal is expected to set out analysis of the original probe and concerns over forensic evidence, the trial and appeal. The case will be submitted to the shyCriminal Cases Review Commission, which decides whether to take it on – with new evidence almost always needed. The CCRC mulls whether the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal, based on whether there is a “real possibility” a conviction would be quashed. The move comes as a dramatisation of Mr Martin’s story screens on Channel  this weekend. He is played by The League of Gentlemen’s Steve Pemberton in The Interrogation, which is based on police interviews. He said of the drama: “It will be interesting to see how it comes over. I’m a simple man really. I see things more clearly than the establishment.”  Mr Martin was in Lincolnshire for a farming show last year when he sought out the grave of Barras, from Newark. He said: “I stayed there for a couple of minshyshyutes. It’s got a photo of Barras on it, the same one used in the papers. “That was the only photo I’d ever seen of him – I couldn’t see him at the time [of the shooting]. “I ran into a guy in the graveyard and asked himhe knew where Barras’s grave was. He said he did. I told him, ‘It’s a strange thing to say but I’m the one who put him there’. “I looked at the grave and said, ‘Well, boy, this is basically what you wanted. You’ve made your mark’. I suppose I made my mark too but my mark came about simply because I happened to live in a house. Barras did what he wanted to do. He had a short le. Seeing the photo and reading about him, he seemed a happy sort of lad.” In August , Mr Martin was charged with murder, attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause injury and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger le. He did not hold a valid shotgun certicate – or the more restrictive firearms certicate needed for the Winchester pump-action shotgun he used. In his trial, the prosecution accused him of lying in wait and opening fire without warning, after previous break-ins. A shot was fired towards the raiders in his shystairwell and two as they fled.  Both suffered leg wounds and Barras was hit in the back, dying at the scene. Fearon and getshyshyaway driver Darren Bark, , admitted conspiring to burshyshygle the house. Fearon got three years’ jail and Bark received  months. In , Mr Martin’s le term was cut to five years on grounds of diminished responsibility, after he was diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder exacerbated by depression. Mr Martin still works the  acres of land at his farm but has not set foot in Bleak House since Barras’s death. He said: “I’ve no end of jobs. I’ve never caught up with the four years I lost.” Of the recent break-in, he said: “I put a ladder out the other day, up a tree. Later, they’d put it against the house. They’d tried to get in.”The Interrogation, Sunday, C, pm."},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results wednesdays winning national","story":"NewsLotto results: Wednesdays winning National Lottery numbers for £.million jackpotTonights Lotto has a huge jackpot while the Millionaire Raffle will create one guaranteed millionaireShareCommentsByLaura Forsyth:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video were-you-lucky-winner-watch-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTonights Lotto draw has an amazing pound.million is up for grabs.

Women across the globe are desperate to copy her looks and get their hands on whatever clothes she wears. Dubbed the Duchess effect her outfits usually sell out within hours of her being photographed in them. But even the most fashion forward of people can still slip up sometimes - something the Duchess of Sussex proved to be true over the weekend.  The expectant mother accompanied her husband and other family members to the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday November . On first glance the -year-old looked incredibly chic in a black Stella McCartney coat dress, which cleverly hid her baby bump thanks to a big bow. She wore her dark hair down, tucked behind her ears and paired the dress with a black clutch and heels. But people couldnt help notice that something about her ensemble was a little odd - and its all to do with her tights.  Meghan, who has famously opted to forgo wearing hosiery thus far, decided to put on a pair of shiny, nude tights for the event. And many people on social media were bemused by the way they looked. One person wrote: Meghan rewearing her fab Stella McCartney coat from Cardf visit, but I cannot get over the glare of these tights. Another said: What has happened to Meghan Markles tights  Has she spilt her wine   However others found this criticism incredibly offensive and highlighted how dficult it can be to find tights that match your skin colour. I feel so sorry for Meghan Markle because her every move is scrutinized because shes American, a commoner older and biracial. Now they are talking about her nude colour tights. They dont exactly match her skin tone. Well, this is a COMMON problem for women of colour, argued one Twitter user. Another added: Do we really have nothing better to talk about on Remembrance Day than Meghans tights  This isnt the first time the duchess has come under fire for her choice of hosiery.  In May, she wore a similar pair of tights to Prince Charles th birthday party at Buckingham Palace and was also criticised for them. She has since been seen stepping out in public with bare legs. Some have suggested that the decision to cover her skin may not have been her own - as it is commonly thought that the Queen has an unwritten rule about guests and family members wearing tights at royal events. However Marlene Koenig, royal expert and Royal Musings blog founder, told BAZAAR this isnt actually true. She said: There are no rules for royal women regarding pantyhose. While most womenwear pantyhouse with suits or gowns for a good slim line, it is not required by any decree from the Queen. What do you think of Meghans tights  Let us know in the comments below.

She said she was told to bring the banana into the supermarket and was offered a pound voucher.But Gemma claims when her friend asked whether the supermarket would be checking bunches of the fruit, Asda said this was not possible.The mum continued: I am a bit disgusted with how they handled it to be honest. They should have done more, not just palmed me off with a pound voucher.I wanted to warn parents to check their childrens fruit before giving it to them.

Alana Burns, who is due to give birth in March, has crammed her kids Alisha, two, Steven, four, Cayden, seven, Leigh, , and Caitlin, , as well as adult children Stewart, , and Bryan, , in the flat above a pub. The family has squeezed into three of the four bedrooms as the fourth is uninhabitable due to a leak. Ms Burns said: My relationship with some of my children is at breaking point. We cant keep living like this. I just want to get out of this hell. Id rather live anywhere , as long as it is not in here. It has been really tough. The council has been out to the leak and said theyd get in touch with me, I have heard nothing. The family was living in a private let in nearby Livingston until her landlord decided to sell the property in August. They spent a month in hotels before West Lothian Council found the Bathgate flat in September.  But Ms Burns added: Im feeling down every night and sometimes you just feel like giving up. But I just have to keep going for the sake of the kids. It is not safe for anyone to be sleeping in that room so were now down to eight people sharing three bedrooms which is ridiculous. Ms Burns says the flat, which does not have a television or room outside in which her children can play, also has uneven flooring, damaged ceilings, noisy neighbours and is not receiving post. She is having to pay out pound a day on electricity and claims a third party is using her supply. The mother continued: We all have to wake up at .am and a taxi picks the kids up at .am to take them to school in Livingston. I need a proper house where I can bring up my children. The whole situation is unbelievable. My kids cant go out to play here. The road in front is busy and there is a car park at the back of the property so it isnt safe. All the kids are stuck inside all night crammed in without any TV. There is no way were using anywhere near that level of electricity. We wouldnt be herewe had a choice but we need to now get out as soon as possible.  A West Lothian Council spokesman said: It can be challenging to find suitable accommodation for large families who present themselves as homeless, given the limited stock of larger homes available. In this case, the council arranged for temporary accommodation from a private landlord to try and meet their housing needs until a permanent home could be found. Previous repairs notied by Ms Burns have been fixed by the landlord. The leak was only notied to us on November , with a repair to be arranged soon. We would encourage Ms Burns to engage with the offers of support already made, to allow us to help find a solution for her familys housing needs. This includes widening her choice of areas to maximise her opportunities for permanent housing.

Were talking about an incident that came before both of these, a time when he had his sight set on a dferent woman all together. But there was one problem - she wasnt interested in him that way.  According to a Channel  documentary called The Royal House of Windsor, Charles honorary grandfather Lord Mountbatten never wanted the young prince to be with Camilla, so attempted to set him up with his granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull. At nine years his junior and despite being his cousin, Amanda was considered the perfect candidate for Charles. For years, Mountbatten was secretly lining Amanda up as a future queen, explained the narrator.  They went on to reveal that her mother is Patricia Knatchbull, Countess Mountbatten of Burma and her father was the late John Knatchbull, Baron Brabourne.

Students at Woodchurch High School in Wirral will not be allowed to wear branded coats such a Moncler, Canada Goose and Pyrenex, after the Christmas break. The Church of England Academy school wrote to parents and carers to say the high-end coats, which can cost upwards of pound for children and over the pound, mark for adults, will be banned in January, reports Liverpool Echo.The letter, which spells two of the brands incorrectly, says: As you are all aware from an email that was sent out yesterday, pupils will not be permitted to bring in CanadianGoose and Monclaircoats after the Christmas break.

Some have also asked whether Pyrenex coats, which are also in a similar price rangewill also be prohibited. I am writing to confirm that these brands will also be prohibited after Christmas. Thank you for your on going support.  Explaining its decision, a spokesman for Woodchurch High School said that the school is concerned with poverty proofing and its policy has always been to minimise unorm costs to parents and carers. Poverty proofing is the phrase given to moves to stop pupils feeling embarrassed or disadvantaged because of their parents income. A spokesman for Woodchurch High School, which has , pupils, said: We are concerned with poverty proofing in school, where issues can routinely,unintentionally, stigmatise children living in poverty and contribute to the increasing cost of the school day to parents and carers. It has always been our policy to minimise the cost to parents and carers of unorm.  The decision was taken following consultation with representatives of the pupils themselves and has been welcomed by the vast majority of parents and carers who have responded to the letter. However, parents took to social media with mixed views on the ban. One mum said: Its been the cause of bullying for so long and those that do have them can still wear out of school. Its a win, win. A fellow parent echoed her comment and wrote: Wow a school actually acting on bullying. Another said: Brilliant thing from a high school.

Watts is now facing le behind bars without the possibility of parole. He will be sentenced on November . After Shanann, Bella and Celeste vanished three months ago, the murderer made a tearful TV plea to find them.Days later, on August , he was arrested but denied he had killed them.  However, he began repeatedly changing his story to police. He claimed that his we had strangled their daughters in revenge after he revealed he was having an affair and wanted to split. He allegedly told detectives that he flew into a rage and strangled Shanann after catching her in the act on a baby monitor screen. But police rejected Wattss story and charged him with three counts of first-degree murder. Bella and Celestes bodies were found on the property of Anadarko Petroleum, one of Colorados largest oil and gas drillers. Shanann was discovered dead in a shallow grave nearby. The mum had been initially reported missing after ing home from a business trip to Arizona at around am. Watts had spent the weekend at home with their children.

Ahead of Wattss guilty pleas last week, it had been reported that the killer was on suicide watch and was not doing well at all. A source told People: “The gravity of the situation has hit him like a ton of bricks. Depression is setting in, and he’s despondent.  Shanann and her daughters were laid to rest on September . In a moving tribute at their funeral service, the mums brother, Frankie Rzucek, said she had wanted a great le for her children. I always worried about her and the girls being so far, because I couldnt protect them, said Frankie. Meanwhile, a tribute from Shananns dad read: Daddy loves you. You are a wonderful daughter and a great mother. You are nothing but pure love, always caring fro everyone. You will always be Daddys little girl.

The lawyer added the records showed CIA doctors were indispensable to the effort of legitimizing the program.” Abu Zubaydahs capture in Pakistan in  prompted the CIA under President George W.

The woman, known only as Sangita, was admitted to the hospital suffering from severe stomach pains. Concerned, doctors ran a series of tests to see what might be behind her painful symptoms. They were left totally dumbfounded when they saw a lump in her stomach containing dozens of foreign objects. The patient,was thought to have swallowed the items over long periods of time causing the metal to build up and her stomach to harden.  Dr Nitin Parmar, senior surgeon at the Ahmedabad Civil hospital in India said:“The stomach of the woman had become rock hard. When we conducted the X-ray, it showed a lump in her stomach. Safety pins consumed by her had partially perforated her lungs, a pin that she had consumed even punctured her stomach walls prompting us to carry out the surgery immediately.”  Doctors were then given the grim task of removing the ious items she had consumed, many of which were sharp and metallic.  One item recovered in the procedure was a mangalsutra, a traditional necklace worn by married Hindu women. Stranger still was the reason why she had consumed these items in the first place.  Sangita was thought to be suffering from acuphagia a rare disorder where a person consumes sharp metallic and indigestible objects. Prior to her surgery and admission to a government hospital she was found wandering the streets. After a few days, she started complaining of the pain in her stomach. She will be kept in observation by doctors to ensure that no further obstructions can enter her system.

While looking incredible for his age, Mickey Mouse has undergone some big changes across nine decades . For example, the first ever version of the lovable character was actually called Mortimer and only for Walt Disneys we Lillian did he get re-branded with his new moniker, Mickey. Now Disney are inviting the world to join in the celebrations and step into his world - born from the mind of a total genius. As part of a host of celebrations to mark  years of Mickey, Disney has launched the True Original Exhibition in New York as well as a free art exhibition in London.  The interactive New York pop-up is a tidal wave of all things Mickey - from original work commissioned by contemporary artists, to the very first motion sketch of the loveable rodent himself. New Yorks True Original Exhibition features original work by  artists - each bringing their own flare in pieces representing what Mickey means to them. This is far from a simple gallery of exhibits - its a total multi-sensory experience. British artist Michael Bosanko was approached by Disney to make his own contribution to the New York exhibition in the form of his light paintings.  His work is created using light to draw images in mid-air, capturing it on camera in a single shot. Speaking about being a part of the Mickey th celebrations, Michael, based near Caerphilly in South Wales, said: Mickey is just such an icon and hes an image recognised across the whole world. I was approached to take part and immediately said yes. Some of the artists are as young as  and have come from dferent walks of le, each creating totally unique and inspiring pieces and Im immensely proud of what weve created collectively. Its an honour to show my work alongside them and be a part of the True Original th celebration. The ,sq ft exhibition itself is set across  rooms - each filled with something truly jaw-dropping - cameras must constantly be at the ready!  The Mirror had the chance to step into this marvellous Mickey world in New York - and to say expect the unexpected is an understatement. The exhibits start in the early days of Mickeys le, in his first ever motion pictures Steamboat Willie and Plane Crazy. Stepping from the introduction cinema room to the first black and white exhibition room is more like taking a leap from the real world straight into a Mickey cartoon itself. The room is filled with D sculptures and floor to ceiling posters of old school Mickey - and of course his long-suffering girlfriend Minnie. The rooms seamlessly flow from one to the next, with each presenting a magical feast for the eyes, often including thought-provoking, contemporary works. In the fourth room, named Ink  Paint, visitors are transported from Mickeys black and white days to a world of stunning technicolour, paying homage to the team of artists and painters in Disneys legendary painting department.  Other rooms document the creation of some of Mickeys most-loved appearances - including his first featurefilm, Fantasia. Exhibit curator Darren Romanelli said: I’m incredibly excited to bring Mickey Mouse back to New York City where Steamboat Willie premiered. The moment becomes even more special by being able to pair art world legends like Kenny Scharf alongside today’s top emerging artists in an exhibition unlike anything we’ve ever seen. These artists have all been touched by the magic of Disney and the experience will reflect that through and through. I can’t wait for the world to see it all come to le. The history of Mickey Mouse Mickey Mouse began le as a basic sketch in  and was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Walt Disney had entered a dispute with his business partner at Universal, and lost the rights to Oswald - triggering the birth of the worlds most famous mouse. Originally called Mortimer Mouse, the moniker didnt last long after Walt Disneys we Lillian said she hated the name and suggested it be changed to Mickey. The first Mickey short to receive signicant attention with synced music and sound was Steamboat Willie, an animation released in November . This was quickly followed by a second animated short, Plane Crazy - and by the end of  - Mickey had become a national fad.  Mickey stayed silent in eight animated shorts, before squeaking his first words in  - hot dogs - in The Karnival Kid. Until then, he had only giggled and squeeled. Bolstered by the marketing and advertising, Walt Disney launched a line of Mickey merchandise and within two years of his creation, the Mickey Mouse fan club for children was set up. Mickey looked much the same for the next seven years, before a young animator called Fred Moore gave him his first makeover - and introduced the Mickey we all know and love today. Previously, Mickeys simplistic design comprised of a series of circles, limiting his movement in animation, before Fred adapted his body to a pear shape, added pupils to his eyes, shortened his nose to make him cuter and added a pair of the now-famous Mickey gloves. By , Disney Studios was producing around  Mickey short animations every year and had the world gripped.  By the s, Mickeys fame had led to theme parks opening in his name, newspaper comic strips, toys, books and magazines. He was officially a household name. Mickey has gone on to become to a pancultural character and brand, with Disney claiming the mouse had a % awareness among children between - worldwide - beating Father Christmas. And despite the huge number of Disney characters which have been created over the last  years, Mickey still represents the true original icon. As Walt Disney said himself: I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing -that it was all started by a mouse.

For the -plus who travelled to watch the weekend win at Ross County, it might be well nigh impossible.Because at the Global Energy Stadium on Saturday, Neilson’s Tangerines looked every inch the kind of side that finish top of this notoriously dficult of leagues. That was largely down to there being nothing pretty about this win.Under McKinnon, Laszlo and even Neilson already, United have shown when it comes to quality football,everything clicks there’s not a team in the second tier who can live with them.They can pass any side off the park, keep possession and conjure enough chances to comfortably win a game.For all but a few sides with genuine aspirations to win the Championship, however, that’s seldom enough. This is a ision where the team finishing first must also have the ability to grind out wins.It’s what St Mirren did last season, Hibs the one before and even Rangers found they had to be able to do as they got up two years ago.Even Neilson’s young Hearts side that galloped away with the title in  did, on the few occasions when necessary, show they could dig deep and battle for points.Now, and arguably for the first time since they dropped down from the top flight, it’s a quality United possess.They ended County’s nine-game unbeaten home run since the start of the campaign, not through playing the kind of football of which we know they’re capable, but by standing up to the physical challenge that’s always posed by the home side up there.Yes, United had to do plenty defending, but through a clear game plan, organisation and a willingness of players to put their bodies on the line, it was executed so well that, for all their territorial dominance, the Staggies had very few clear sights of goal.A nice bonus stemming from that fact was, for the first time in his short tenure, in the build-up to the game injuries were a signicant issue.Frederic Frans and Callum Booth were doubts last week and unable to train with the rest of the squad until a Friday session confirmed they wouldn’t make it. In William Edjenguele and Paul Watson, the manager found able deputies.He’s said since he arrived at Tannadice winning promotion would take a squad of highly committed players.He now knows he has that and try as they might not to, the fans must be getting excited."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/Strictly-Come-Prancing-dancers.jpg ","title":"were doing 20 hours of dancing this week stage all set for strictly come prancing in dundee this weekend","story":"The disco ball is being dusted off as Dundee prepares for its most glamorous charity event of the year. vw, px\"  Strictly Come Prancing takes place this Saturday at pm, with  couples taking to the stage in support of children’s charity Help for Kids.The event, featuring fashion icon Gok Wan as head judge, is being supported by the Evening , Wave FM and the Overgate Shopping Centre.The night is being hosted by the Apex Hotel, and the nerves and excitement are beginning to build as the big day approaches.With precious little rehearsal time left, the Tele caught up with some of the couples before they take their bow.Iain McLeod, , and fiancée Jemma Ward, , from St Mary’s, are one duo in the spotlight.Jemma said: “All the other couples have been really supportive and I think we are all going to go for it on the night.”Another couple – Carolyn McLaren, , from Stobswell, and Mark Rice, , from Fintry – are also taking the plunge on Saturday.

However, it is not something I take for granted and I will still continue to work as hard as I can to get as many caps as I can.”Following his debut in Peru, Shinnie admitted that first cap meant “everything” to him.Now in contention to earn a fth at the Loro Borici Stadium in Shkoder, Albania, on Saturday, the Aberdonian admits he still faces a nervous wait before a Scotland squad is announced.He need not have worried.He said: “Being in Scotland squads and getting caps has been great. However, it is also tough because I never expect to be there and wait patiently for the squad to come out for the next one.“I always just hope I am in the squad when it comes out.”Shinnie’s contract with Aberdeen expires at the end of the season and he will be free to talk to any interested teams from the start of the winter transfer window on January .Aberdeen have tabled a new deal that would make him one of the club’s highest earners.The club captain recently insisted all his focus is on helping the Dons secure success, with the Betfred Cup final looming next month and that thoughts of a new deal were on the back burner.Shinnie is in the squad along with fellow Dons Scott McKenna and Gary Mackay-Steven. McLeish’s selection has been decimated by withdrawals and he is now without another Red, Mikey Devlin, as well as Charlie Mulgrew, Kevin McDonald, Craig Gordon, Stephen O’Donnell and Ryan Jack.Strikers Leigh Grfiths and Steven Naismith are also injured.James McArthur has retired from international football, while Robert Snodgrass and Matt Ritchie have confirmed they would rather not be considered for selection at the moment.Such is the lack of defensive options, uncapped Aberdeen centre-back Devlin, who has forged a strong partnership at club level with McKenna, was in contention to start in Albania.However, Devlin was rated at “-” by Scotland’s medical staff for the game after picking up a knock training with McLeish’s squad, before pulling out all together and being replaced by Celtic’s Jack Hendry.Shinnie said: “It is good for the club to have players in the international squad and shows that the team are doing well. The gafferand the club will be happy with having players in the squad.”The four initial Aberdeen call-ups is recognition for the recent form that has secured a Betfred Cup final slot against Celtic at Hampden on December .“It was very important for the club to get to another cup final,” said Shinnie. “When you are in a final, anything can happen.

I think it’s important to show other people with a disability it doesn’t matter.“You can learn to swim and don’t need to go into private lessons. They can go into the normal Learn to Swim programme.“Swimming’s been a huge part of my le. It’s given me more confidence and so many experiences to travel and meet new people.“If you want to take it up I think it’s a really good thing to do.”Toni’s journey in aquatics began on the Learn to Swim programme at Northfield Swimming Pool, before she joined Cults Otters club.Her talent saw her move to join up with the Aberdeen University high-performance squad.The  Tokyo Paralympics hopeful has experience as an instructor – teaching her own mum how to swim.Her role will involve promoting swimming among youngsters at launches across the country, with world, Olympic and European champion Duncan Scott another of the governing body’s ambassadors. vw, px\"  Paul Wilson, disability performance development manager for Scottish Swimming, said: “Toni has had some success on the international stage, so in terms of inspiration to younger athletes she’s the perfect role model for us.“The key thing is, with her age.

There’s two sides of that – there’s inspiring the next generation of para-swimmers who think ‘I’ve got a disability like Toni, I can do that as well’.“There’s also the other side where it’s educating non-disabled people that a para-swimmer at the high-performance level has the same commitment, effort and mindset that’s needed to progress as a non-disabled swimmer.”Scottish Swimming’s Learn to Swim programme is inclusive, with teachers able to adapt lessons so those with disabilities can take part.There are , kids, from pre-school age upwards, on the programme across Scotland.More information is

States.The seaside town forged links with Acheres in France earlier this year, with the latest agreement to be announced on Saturday by the mayor of Athens, Ronnie Marks.It will take place during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of Athens.Meanwhile, closer to home, the Stonehaven and North East Scotland Twinning Group will take part in the celebrations at Castle Fraser.The historic castle is a twinning partner with the group and will be flying the Alabama state flag and US flag from its turrets later this month.Phil Mills-Bishop, the co-ordinator for the twinning group, was delighted to announce the latest twinning agreement.He said: “Modern twinning is much more than just a civic connection with a plaque, as in the past, but includes educational exchanges, tourist flows, reciprocal sporting events, business opportunities and greater understanding between respective communities.“The twinning group grew out of Stonehaven, which is still very much the place of destination, as the US delegation will be based here next summer when they visit, but also Stonehaven can act as a gateway into other areas within the north-east.“Castle Fraser is an example of that and has been one of our early members and staunch supporters.”A special birthday cake will be baked by castle staff to celebrate the event, with the Scottish delegation joining in celebrations via

Gary was at Celtic and is now at Aberdeen and is maybe putting himself in the shop window for another big move.“It’s great to see them making an impact for Scotland because they are great players and, hopefully, they keep kicking on.”Ahead of the Nations League crunch this week Dow is optimistic about the national team’s chances.Winning group C would guarantee a play-off place in the quest to qualy for the European Championships in .Dow believes there is talent in the Scotland squad and says the fixtures provide Mackay-Steven – who has two caps – and Armstrong – who has nine – with a chance to establish themselves in the national team.He added: “The team gets criticised a lot, but I think there are a lot of players not so much coming through, but trying to establish themselves.“Stuart is  and Gary is  and there are other good players like Callum McGregor and others.“I think we need a bit of luck and to get a couple of results and then you might see us kick on.“The talent is there in the squad.

St Johnstone had a hoodoo over us that season and it’s one of those games that I don’t think we will ever get over.“It’s annoying that we never added a trophy to that couple year spell when we were playing some great football under Jackie McNamara.“It was a good team with really good players, and when you look at Stuart, Gary and Andy it shows the talent that was there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kim inspired by russian mission","story":"A trampolinist has been left “inspired” after competing in the Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships in Russia.Bridge of Don’s Kim Beattie left the major event with a disappointing result due to injury problems.However, the double mini trampolinecompetitor aims to power on and build on her skills ahead of future competitions.Speaking about the championships on her , the University of Aberdeen student admitted to remaining highly optimistic.She said: “My overall experience at worlds was incredible.“I haven’t competed much this year due to injury, so I was so excited to be out on the competition floor.“I am very happy with the passes I competed.“And it is nice to see the improvement in my execution and confidence from worlds last year. “Beattie, who juggles between her university studies and intense training regime as part of Banchory’s Trampoline and DMT Gymnastics Club, placed th inidually at the championships so was unable to qualy for the final.Beattie added: “The standard of competition was so high this year.“I feel really inspired to have competed alongside so many amazing girls.”The event ran from November  to  at its official venue within the St Petersburg Sports and Concert Complex.Despite a pre-worlds schedule punctuated by injury, Beattie’s career will undoubtedly progress further following her string of previous achievements.Last month she received the Student Sports Achiever of the Year title at Aberdeen’s Sports Awards.This came on the back of several fantastic results over a -month periodKim claimed top spot in DMT at the Trampoline, Tumbling and Double Mini Trampoline British Championships.She beat out the likes of Team GB’s Olympic silver medal-winning trampolinist Bryony Page.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13563563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_boyle.jpg","title":"danny boyles armistice tribute pages","story":"NewsDanny Boyles Armistice tribute Pages of the Sea to honour British Armys first black officer on Ayr beachA large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsLieutenant Walter Tull\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first black officer in the British Army will be commemorated on Ayr beach as part of director Danny Boyle’s Armistice commission Pages of the Sea. Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the

Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"defensive mistakes created 12 goal romp","story":"SAFL Premier First DivisionAlex McKinvenWhen last did the Pupils score five goals at home and eventually manage to lose the match The simple answer to the question is never.Readers will be rubbing their eyes in disbelief, but the self destruct button was firmly pushed last Saturday and the home side weren’t alone in a gt strewn afternoon.Both teams seemed determined to outdo one another in a goal fest of biblical proportions.As both sets of coaches closed their eyes in horror, a sizable crowd was entertained as both nets rippled and bulged at regular intervals.With only four league games on it was the perfect opportunity for the winner to go top, an achievement that looked well and truly on when a double from the departing Sary Rahma put the Pupils in pole position.It wasn’t to be the ideal parting gt for the Pupil’s top scorer, a game that could have taken on the guise of a classic, was down to two s unable to defend as units and not as the score suggests the failings of respective defences.It was a crazy match from start to finish the visitors taking an early lead only to be pegged back immediately by Rahma.Neilston restored their lead minutes later, but the McFadyen sponsored Pupils ed to the other end and the game was level once more from a Grumoli strike.The Pupils got their noses in front when Robbie Dudley followed up his own header to score from close range with just  minutes on the clock.Although the game was stretched throughout, it wasn’t devoid of quality,  the home side#s finishing was clinical in the early stages.Three each and only half way through # the referee’s whistle brought the first half to a close and allowed time for everyone to draw breath.Sary Rahma put the home side ahead with  minutes to go and celebrated in some style – possibly his last goal for the home team and maybe the winner The dream finish to a successful stay eluded him, as the home side collapsed in the final quarter to surrender the initiative and points.The extraordinary game also had a thumping free kick from Martin McCallum that almost demolished the cross bar, before he rounded the keeper to narrow the deficit with five minutes left. IIn the final minutes the Pupils were denied what seemed a stonewall penalty.Who knows what the score would have beenit had been given and converted.Looking forward to a better team performance, Campbeltown Pupils travel to play Easthall in the league tomorrow.Gary Grumoli was in the thick of the action till going off injured in the closing moments. _cpupilsSary Rahma caught in a balletic move in front of the Neilston goal. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter campbeltowns role in the perisher","story":"Shortly before the war ended in , HMS Thames, the submarine depot ship, arrived at Campbeltown with her attendant submarines.The Thames was the base for the Periscope School which trained submarine commanding officers in the principles of attacking.The submarines were used to put theory into practice.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges. Working out whether cuts or charges are the best way forward, whilst protecting the vulnerable, will make this yearrsquos budget no easy task. This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further. I am hoping that the budget will provide an opportunity to improve the position."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-for-140-holiday-lodges-at-former-golf-course","story":"Whitekirk Hill, which already has planning permission to revamp the clubhouse at the former Whitekirk Golf and Country Club, hopes to build ldquocirca  holiday lodges and woodland pods on the site.Debate centring on the development, which will be determined by the councilrsquos planning committee, has been ongoing for months.Tony Thomas, representing Whitekirk Hill, said: ldquoWhitekirk Hill Ltd is delighted to reach this milestone after months of hard work completing the environmental impact assessment .

Work would be spread over six phases and it is anticipated it could be phased over the next  years.The golf club opened in  and planning permission was given nine years ago to expand the facility, with plans including a -bed hotel, new clubhouse, a second course,  lodges and  homes, but that never got off the ground.Eric Martin, who lives in the village and is part of Dunpender Community Council, said residents were still looking at the plans before forming an opinion.Save Whitekirk Campaign has set up an online petition in opposition to the plans.A spokesman said: ldquoThe plans to destroy this wonderful landscape, a haven for wildle, show no respect for the countryside or local communities and are driven solely by profit. With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

The location has been selected as it forms the primary gateway into the town and is visible from the railway line, said the applicants.Ken Ross, from applicant Hallhill Development Ltd, said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Scottish Government has approved this fantastic piece of public art and are actively engaged with Andy to get the bear erected in Dunbar in spring .ldquoThis piece of art will not only contribute to the emerging identity of Dunbarrsquos new gateway but has the potential to draw people into the area to find out more about John Muir.Mr Ross was confident the sculpture would prove popular with children and would become a landmark.The sculpture is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, heavy at the bottom and lighter towards the top. Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire. He said: ldquoThe proposal has had a range of dferent opinions within the community.ldquoHowever, any piece of new artwork that is ever produced and put into a location always has dferent opinions from dferent people about whether it is good or not.ldquoThe artist selected to produce this is well-known.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

properties in a key location next to good schools, public transport links, amenities and facilities, with a minimal capital outlay for the council.ldquoThe fact that these homes will eventually revert

through other financial models.ldquoThis project fits in perfectly with our Draft Strategic Housing Investment Plan, which sets out an ambition to deliver a further , new affordable homes.The innovative funding model allows the council to use funding support from Scottish Government to deliver much-needed new socially rented homes, with the private sector funding enabling mid-market rental homes in this case.Neil McCormick, managing director, Robertson Capital Projects, said: ldquoWe have been working incredibly hard for the last two years to make this delivery and funding model a reality because we understood the need for private sector support in order for local authorities to meet their key housing targets.ldquoI am confident that it will be the first of many.ldquoWe are

You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree.

We know in any criminal trial the test is whether or not the prosecution has proved its case ldquobeyond reasonable doubt. If not, juries have to acquit. Which means not guilty ndash there is no middle way in the law. So why, in effect, have two not guilty verdicts Some lawyers, like Derek Ogg QC, have argued that logically it is the ldquonot guilty verdict that should go. This would concentrate jurorsrsquo minds on deciding whether or not the prosecution case had been ldquoproven beyond reasonable doubt. This is apparently how it was in Scottish courts in the th century. The ldquonot guilty verdict was reintroduced in the th century.However, many lawyers used to argue that the not proven verdict harmed the accused, not the accuser. Having a jury rule that the case against you was ldquonot proven might suggest that you got off on a technicality, or that the prosecution just hadnrsquot got its act together. Defence lawyers argued that guilt should be expunged by an unequivocal declaration of not guilty ndash meaning he or she really, really didnrsquot do it. The late former Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, moved a Commons Bill in  to have the ldquobastard verdict, as Sir Walter Scott called it, scrapped. But this wasnrsquot because he thought it would necessarily make rape convictions easier.Not proven still has its defenders. Some say abolition would undermine Scots law and that we shouldnrsquot be importing an Anglicised system on a wave of emotion. It is good for juries to have more than one option so that they can express a degree of doubt, or qualication. Brian McConnachie QC, the former President of the Criminal Bar Association, has pointed out abolishing it could have unintended consequences. As we discovered during the debate about scrapping corroboration in rape trials, getting rid of one anomaly often creates a raft of new ones.In Scottish jury trials there need only be a simple majority for conviction, eight to seven in a -person jury. In England the test is much stricter ndash there are smaller juries and the majority has to be  out of . If not proven is dispensed with, many would argue that the Scottish majoritarian system would have to go too. This might actually make it harder to get rape convictions.Indeed, you could argue that not proven gives an ldquoeasy option the other way ndash in favour of the accuser. It allows juries who believe the ldquovictim, but are not convinced by the prosecutionrsquos handling of the case, to say: ldquoWe think he or she probably did do it, even though the evidence isnrsquot conclusive. This arguably sends a signal to the civil courts that this person might be guilty on the balance of probabilities. Civil courts are less strict on the need to prove ldquobeyond reasonable doubt.This is actually what happened in the case of Miss M, the rape victim who has been arguing for not proven to be scrapped. She made legal history last month by taking the not proven verdict against former student Stephen Coxen to the Personal Injuries Court in Edinburgh, where it was effectively reversed. She was awarded pound, in damages. Of course, that raises further questions about double jeopardy. If someone is found not guilty in one court, does it makes sense for them to be found guilty in another If you accept the #metoo doctrine ndash ldquoalways believe the victim ndash then you donrsquot really need trials at all. However, this causes problems when the wrong people get accused. When one of the leading figures in the #metoo movement, the Hollywood actress Asia Argento, was accused in August of statutory rape of an underage boy in Calornia, her defenders insisted that she should be given the benefit of ldquodue process, and be innocent until proven guilty. This was correct. The rush to judgment was wrong and unfair ndash even though she reportedly gave the ldquovictim , to settle the claim privately.The problem with sexual assault and rape is that they often involve dficult cases relying, in the absence of corroboration, on ldquohe said she said and the credibility of the parties involved. I have never sat on a rape case jury, but Irsquove spoken to many who have, and they tell me the cases often involve alcohol and vague and muddled memories. It is probably the case that too few rapists are being punished. But tipping the scales in favour of the victims doesnrsquot always work.The justice system in England has been rocked by the collapse of a succession of highly-publicised rape trials in which the police withheld, or failed to disclose, evidence crucial tothe defence. The former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, had to make a formalapology, and then resigned last month, after a review covering just two months of English rape cases found that  had to be halted because the police had failed to hand over evidence of innocence. The police insist that they werenrsquot trying to rig the prosecutions. But the head of the politan Police, Cressida Dick, has since issued new guidance saying that ldquocomplainants in rape and sexual assault cases should be listened to, but not automatically believed. ldquoItrsquos not all about the victims she said.Justice is hard. The debate over not proven has been grinding on for a long time. Holyroodrsquos Justice Committee has said that the dual acquittal is on ldquoborrowed time ndashwhich I suppose is itself a kind of not proven verdict. Scrapping the Scottish verdictis beginning to look well nigh inevitable. But whether or not this will increase rape convictions is, well, not proven."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-christmas-festival-has-113m-boost-for-the-city-report-finds","story":"Underbelly, the major Fringe producers who also manage the Christmas festival and Hogmanay, said last years events - which include an ice rink, a market, a city centre fair and other attractions - drew , visitors.Over the six week run, the Christmas festival grew its audience by .%, which was up from , visitors the previous year, a report by BOP Consulting has found.Underbelly recently released an impact assessment, by the same company, for Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay which showed an economic impact for Edinburgh from the festival in   of poundm.Footfall to Edinburghrsquos Christmas three main sites was counted at .m.The centre of the city is transformed during the festival, with attractions, rides, food markets and a big wheel taking up Princes Street Gardens and St Andrew Square.More than , tickets were bought for Edinburghrsquos Christmas rides, attractions and shows last year.The majority of the attendees were from outside Edinburgh and the Lothian area.Of the % who came from outside the capital, around seven per cent came from  dferent countries including Australia, Ireland, USA, Holland, Spain, Canada, France, Germany and New Zealand.Last year was the fth year of Underbelly produced Edinburghrsquos Christmas for the City of Edinburgh Council.

The truth is much more worrying ndash it simply hasnrsquot looked.When I sit with people on Universal Credit, it is the administrative chaos that is most obvious. Journalists have reported on many horric cases, but it is the everyday pressures caused by delays, computer issues, documents going missing, as well as the ever-present threat of sanctions, that reveal just how badly this system is failing many families.Universal Creditrsquos architects, the Centre for Social Justice and Iain Duncan Smith, have argued that it is spending cuts that have caused the problems. They have a point. Yet while the Budget partly reversed one of these cuts, Universal Credit bears the scars of eight years of cutbacks with much more planned.Churches, charities and claimants themselves have repeatedly said that Universal Credit leads many towards financial crisis and even hunger. The UK Government has vigorously rejected these claims, but has never backed this up with direct evidence.A Government survey of claimants showed that  in  families were struggling. In response the head of the Universal Credit programme admitted that the survey design means itrsquos not possible to tellUniversal Credit makes things better or worse. In the words of the National Audit Office, the DWP ldquodoes not know how many claimants are having problems withor have suffered hardship.William Beveridge designed the current benefit system  years ago with the express intention of ending poverty, or in his words the ldquogiant evil of ldquoWant. Today, the purpose of Universal Credit is very dferent.The purpose of Universal Credit is made clear in DWP documents that describe how the systemrsquos success or failure is judged. It aims to increase employment by \"changing the behaviours and attitudes of low-income families.Questions around families being able to cope, experiencing hardship or needing to use foodbanks simply do not appear. There is however copious data about peoplersquos job searches and their attitudes to work.The result is thatyou ask how strongly claimants agree with the statement \"any job is better than none the DWP can give you full and detailed answers. Ask whether those same families can feed their children and the silence will be deafening.A benefit system is always a balancing act between competing principles. Overall cost, incentivising work and ensuring that families have enough money have always been set against each other. Universal Credit strikes a new balance emphasising lower costs and work incentives. These necessarily come at the expense of providing an adequate income.Churches are seeing some of the human consequences of this new balance. Some impacts, such as the run on foodbanks, can be counted. We also hear stories of families needing help to get nappies for newborns, or unwell folk walking for hours to get to the Jobcentre because they cannot afford a bus.Today these peoplersquos experiences are being brushed under the carpet ndash but it is these peoplersquos voices that must be heardwe are to stop Universal Credit pushing families towards foodbanks.The Budget announcement of a few billion and further delays will not rescue Universal Credit.A properly funded ing benefit system has the potential to enable people held back by poverty to reach their full potential. However, this is impossible in families that are simply focusing on finding their next meal. The principle of preventing hardship must be reintroduced.Universal Credit needs a comprehensive overhaul where genuine poverty experts ndash those who face poverty every day ndash are included in the process. This is not an impractical pipe dream ndash Scotlandrsquos experience  are already helping design the new Scottish Social Security System.I do not know what the result of such a redesign would be but I do know that by tackling hunger and listening to those affected by the benefit system we have a much better chance of releasing the enormous potential that Universal Credit increasingly locks away.Rev Dr Richard Frazer is the Convener of the Church of Scotlandrsquos Church and Society Council"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-black-and-ethnic-minority-teachers-are-being-ground-down","story":"One of the reasons for the lack of recruitment of black and minority ethnicteachers across the UK is that they have not grown up in classrooms with BME teachers.Their children are not surrounded by BME teachers so it is not a profession that necessarily sends strong signals saying BME teachers belong.We would argue there has to be a national campaign to say we need more teachers from these backgrounds, but there is no evidence of that.A lot of the experiences of people from BME backgrounds in schools is around the colour of their skin and our studies have shown how profound and pernicious that experience in school can be.It is the subtle and insidious ways they were not promoted, the slights and micro aggressions which held them back or damaged their confidence.Teachers from all backgrounds, regardless of ethnic group, want to be teachers for the same reasons ndash because they have a commitment to the pupils, a passion to be a mentor and so on.It is not a lack of commitment that wears them down, but a reflection of those everyday experiences of being racially discriminated against.That comes on top of everything  that teachers are having to deal with, from an increasing workload to being undervalued in terms of pay.You also have to ask about retention and evidence from surveys we have been involved with suggest people are leaving the profession because they are being ground down. There are issues with BME teachers dropping out in the first three years of teaching.Equality issues in schools in general do not seem to be a strong enough focus and that is a particular case in terms of race.We have evidence that Muslim teachers are particularly struggling with racism in schools, and that can be from pupils or subtle messages from other teachers.Another key issue is that teachers talk about how racism in school has become more of an issue in the context of Brexit.

However no official complaint was ever made.The SNP Government has repeatedly insisted there were no recorded complaints against Mr Salmond before January.Mr Robertson lost his seat in June  but continued as the SNPrsquos deputy leader until earlier this year.He previously said: ldquoGiven ongoing inquiries Irsquom not making any comments at this stage."},{"url":null,"title":"headteachers-back-action-to-support-ethnic-minority-teachers","story":"Both secondary and primary heads said the barriers identied in the promotion of black and ethnic minorityteachers would be taken ldquoextremely seriously.A Scottish Government-backed report, entitled Teaching in a Diverse Scotland, said the countryrsquos education system could no longer shy away from ldquoracism, racial discrimination or harassment.The working group report found the lack of ersity in the teaching profession was caused by a range of barriers ldquothroughout the arc of their career.The report recommended that by next summer Education Scotland should update all leadership programmes to help headteachers understand the impact of ldquoeveryday racism, institutional racism or bias.The working group also wants schools to identy and encourage BME pupils who would make good teachers while ethnic minority teachers who are ambitious should be encouraged to apply for promotion.Jim Thewliss, general secretary of School Leadersrsquo Scotland, which represents secondary heads, said: ldquoWe are well aware of both gender balance and the ethnicity issue.

She has broken the first rule of democratic power: she has displeased most of the people most of the time - and yet stayed in office. That is not easy.There is, of course, a political explanation for her endurance. Her party does not want to fight a leadership contest that would be yet another battle in a decades-long civil war over the EU. Michael Keating, professor of politics at Aberdeen University, explains: \"There could be no agreement about her replacement because there could be no agreement about Brexit.\"Mrs May balances Remainers and Leavers in her own cabinet. And not always successfully. She has lost two Johnson brothers from her government, Leaver Boris and Remainer Jo.The politics may explain why she has managed to stay. It must, however, take character to want to do so. Mrs May, even her enemies privately admit, has been dogged, determined, thrawn. She has stickability.There is another word those complimenting Mrs May reach for. It is far from traditional praise: Britains prime minister is, well, relatively normal.In an age of demagoguery, of populism and of Twitter tantrums, Mrs May also stands out as much for what she is not as for much as for what she is.Because - let us say it out loud - the prime minister is not Donald Trump. Imagine how Americas thin-skinned president would have responded to the kind of pressure his UK counterpart has endured The prime minister does not have the folksy easy charm of a Blair, or even a Clinton or a Bush. Voters probably would not want a beer with her. Or even a sherry. She may be of the right, but she is of the mainstream right. She can still fit on to a political spectrum of a European liberal democracy. A replacement may not.Speaking just as Mrs May was elected, PJ ORourke, the American republican commentator, through grinning but gritted teeth, endorsed Hillary Clinton. \"I mean, shes wrong about absolutely everything,\" he explained. \"But shes wrong within normal parameters.Would Boris Johnson be \"within normal parameters\"  Nigel Farage  Arron Banks Would Jeremy Corbyn  Maybe. But the Labour leader, even as the grim reality of Brexit becomes clear, cannot quite convince enough Britons he is PM material. Mrs Mays Tories, despite everything, despite a raging binfire over Europe, remain clear in the polls.David Cameron was blandly \"within normal parameters\". The Tory prime-minister-cum-PRman tried and failed his own balancing act between what was then called Eurosceptics and Europhiles. His solution was a referendum on EU membership. His Remainer side lost and he quit. Now there was a Weeble who wobbled and very much fell down.Mr Camerons party avoided a membership vote for a new leader - one Prof Keating reckons could never be won by a Remainer.

Earlier in the day, prominent Leaver Peter Bone warned Mrs May she risked losing the support of \"many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country\".Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeted: \"Any cabinet member who is a genuine Brexiteer must now resign or never be trusted again, this is the worst deal in history.\"The DUP, which props up Mrs Mayrsquos Government, has repeatedly insisted it will not back a deal that treats Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.Last night, senior DUP MP Sammy Wilson said: \"Its a poor deal. Its a bad deal. Its a deal that she said shed never accept. I think that people will be appalled at this deal.News an agreement had been reached between EU and UK officials broke on Tuesday. The full, -page text was published last night.It includes plans for a -month transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March , as well as a so-called orce bill which is believed to be around pound billion.But controversy centres on plans for a ldquobackstop to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Both the UK and EU will \"use their best endeavours\" to achieve a future trade agreement by July  ndash six months before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, said the European Commission.Should this not be possible, the UK and EU could jointly agree to extend the transition period.Alternatively, they could introduce a \"backstop\" arrangement from January , establishing a \"single EU-UK customs territory\" to apply until a new trade deal is implemented, covering all goods except fishery and aquaculture products.Northern Ireland would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring Britain to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections.Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, told reporters in Brussels: \"In addition Northern Ireland will remain aligned to those rules of the single market that are essential for avoiding a hard border.Mr Rees-Mogg said the plans would see dferent rules for Northern Ireland, adding: ldquoThis is unacceptable to Unionists particularly in Northern Ireland, and Scotland where the SNP will seek to demand similar internal UK border to weaken the Union.The level of Brexiteer discontent has raised expectations that Mrs May faces further letters of no confidence from Tory MPs, with a total of  needed to trigger a vote on her position.Sources within Westminster said the delivery of letters to the chair of the backbench  Committee Sir Graham Brady was \"imminent\".Mrs May described the debate around the famous Cabinet table as \"long, detailed and impassioned\", in an apparent indication that her proposals had come under intense challenge from ministers."},{"url":null,"title":"barnier-says-the-uks-draft-brexit-text-is-a-decisive-and-crucial-step","story":"He said the UK would remain \"a friend, a partner and an ally\", that there was \"still a lot of work\" to be done and that the future relationship will be on the basis of duty and quota-free trade.And he warned: \"The two negotiating teams have taken their responsibility. The British government has taken today its responsibility. Now, everybody on both sides has to take their responsibility.\"Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentrsquos Brexit coordinator, also backed the agreement, saying that negotiators had tried to ldquomake the best of the bad situation.Mr Barnier reassured the three million EU citizens in the UK and the one million British citizens living in an EU country that they could continue to live, study and work there throughout the transitional period and \"throughout their letime\".Britain would leave the EU and all its institutions on March ,  but there would be a planned transitional period to December ,  to \"allow business to prepare and adapt before implementation\".The UK has agreed to be bound by a UK-wide Brexit \"backstop\" which will effectively keep Britain in a customs union with the EUthe prime minister fails to secure an alternative arrangement before the end of the two-year Brexit transition period.A customs union reduces administrative and financial trade barriers such as customs checks and charges, and boosts economic co-operation.Mr Barnier said the single EU-UK customs territory, of which Northern Ireland would be a part, would mean that UK goods get tarf and quota-free access to the EU market.The transitional period could be extended \"once\" for a limited period by joint agreement.And Mr Barnier was positive about the EU relationship with the UK saying: \"We are drawing the basis for an ambitious partnership, which we want, which is a free trade area based on regulatory and customs co-operation in depth and with a level playing field.\"Our objective is to abolish customs duties and quotas for all goods based on what we are proposing in the withdrawal agreement, a single customs territory.\"He spoke after briefing ambassadors from the  member states in Brussels, as part of a carefully choreographed response to the agreement reached, including the controversial Irish backstop which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event this is not settled by a UK-EU trade deal.He explained that Northern Ireland would stay in the same customs territory as the rest of the UK but that the region would remain aligned to some EU regulations to avoid a hard border.That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to seethey meet EU rules \"in the least intrusive way possible\".Both sides resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.Mr Barnier saidthis is not possible by July , the transition period could be extended - andit is still not settled by the end of the transition, the backstop would \"kick in\".This would involve a joint UK-EU \"single customs territory\", so customs checks are not needed on the border.Northern Ireland would stay aligned to the EU single market rules that are \"essential for the avoidance of a hard border\", Mr Barnier added. He said the backstop plan had \"evolved considerably\" and had been based on the UKs proposal.He said: \"If we are not ready by July , we could jointly decide to extend the transition to provide for more time\"This backstop is not meant to be used. Our objective remains to reach a new agreement between the EU and the UK before the end of the transition.\"In closing, Mr Barnier said:\"It is the basis of a plan. We are going to start working with the  member states, and I will start tomorrow with the European Parliament on this draft political declaration.\"We have reached an important moment in this extraordinary negotiation which we entered into at the request of the United Kingdom.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amThis week#s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services. We all need to be well prepared before driving in winter weather and drive according to conditions.Thursday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Executive chairman Wolfhart Hauser had taken over at the helm following O’Toole’s departure, but will now revert back to his non-executive chairman’s role.Details of the changes came as the group reported interim pre-tax losses widening to £. million in the six months to  September from £.m a year earlier due to restructuring and reorganisation costs from the withdrawal of Greyhound services in Western Canada.But revenues rose . per cent to £. billion and on an underlying and constant currency basis, pre-tax profits jumped . per cent to £m, while earnings lted . per cent to £.m.But FirstGroup warned that its rail arm, which includes the South Western Railwayand Great Western Railway franchises, would see annual underlying operating profits fall year-on-year. Half-year underlying rail earnings reversed . per cent to £.m.On the rail performance, FirstGroup said: “Industry conditions remain very challenging with macroeconomic uncertainty, infrastructure upgrade works across our networks and the industrial action in SWR all affecting our franchise performance levels.”The group’s overall performance has been weighed down by woes at its Greyhound bus service in the US, which has been struggling amid the rising popularity of low-cost airline competition.Greyhound’s interim underlying operating profits more than halved to £.m from £.m a year ago. But the firm said its group-wide performance was “encouraging” in the first half and maintained its overall outlook for the full-year.Gregory said: “Our First Rail operations continued to focus on improving services for our passengers while maintaining overall profitability in a more challenging industry environment during the period.”John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin Scotland, said: “In , FirstGroup ceased paying idends in order to reduce debt and refocus the business.“However, shareholders have yet to see the benefits of this action in terms of positive .

But I think people will also understand serious concerns and complaints have been raised. People raising those complaints now deserve to have the benefit of due process.“I will answer all and any questions when legal processes have concluded, but I think as most people will understand, it is neither possible nor appropriate for me to do so at this time.”Scottish Labour’s Equalities spokeswoman Pauline McNeill MSP said the First Minister was attempting to “hide behind process”.: Alex Salmond harassment probe investigates alleged incidents at Edinburgh AirportShe said: “The allegations facing Alex Salmond are extremely serious and deserve proper scrutiny.“But Nicola Sturgeon seems determined to hide behind process rather than be honest about who knew what and when – and crucially what was done to protect women.“That is unacceptable.

He’s about to get on a plane but the worn white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard, on which he wrote best selling hits with his band Chic and produced some of the biggest-selling albums of all time with David Bowie, Madonna and Diana Ross, won’t be shoved in the hold. The Hitmaker, as he calls it, and which is integral to his funky ‘chucking’ style, won’t be out of his sight. He left it on a train once, luckily got it back, but yes, he did freak out...The Grammy Award-winning musician, composer, arranger, guitarist and co-founder of Chic says, “I have a replica, and a plexiglass one and they sound really great live and on record, real close, but it’s not the same.” Rodgers is about to fly out of Toronto when we speak, heading for London in his trademark dreadlocks and beret to put the funk into the X Factor, replacing the touring Robbie Williams as a judge. He’s also collecting a humanitarian award from the Global Gt charity for his work with his We Are Family Foundation, named for his Sister Sledge anthem. Career-wise he’s flying high too, after releasing the first Chic album for more than two decades this summer featuring Elton John, Emeli Sandé and Lady Gaga, with another album due out in February and about to kick off a -date European and UK tour with the band that’ll make Glasgow Dance, Dance, Dance in December. He’s the newly elected Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and as the recently-appointed inaugural Chief Creative Advisor for Abbey Road Studios, it’s time to celebrate Good Times. Rodgers is responsible for decades of floorfillers, after starting out as a musician on Sesame Street, playing clubs and bars before co-founding Chic in  with bassist Bernard Edwards. There were Chic disco hits: Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love, Le Freak and Good Times, and hits he produced for others: He’s The Greatest Dancer, We Are Family, , I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, , Like A Virgin, , Let’s Dance . Then there are his collaborations, with Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories album and single Get Lucky, global hits that won him three Grammys, with Avicii, Sigala Disclosure and Sam Smith, plus the genre crossing talent that saw Good Times spark the advent of hip-hop when it was picked up as the base for Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. In all, his work has sold more than  million albums and  million singles, but it’s been  years since Nile Rodgers and Chic released a studio album. Hence the title It’s About Time. “Yes,” he laughs. “For one thing there’s the obvious – it was about time I did this stuff and got it back out.” It would have been earlier, but as Rodgers was working on the album the deaths of his friends and previous collaborators Prince, David Bowie, George Michael and Chris Cornell hit him hard. “What happened was I had got a large tape drop from Warner Brothers of masters that I thought were gone for ever and that made me feel so happy and nostalgic and I was about to release an album. But then people started passing away that I had written tribute songs about, and it made me feel like I’d be capitalising on Bowie and Prince’s passing, and it was just so wrong.”The time is right now, however, and at , Rodgers has been thinking about mortality. He’s beaten prostate cancer once in  and last year had a lump removed from his kidney. Today he declares himself fit and healthy,a little tired from last night’s Toronto gig, but he’s determined to fulfil his mission to get everyone dancing to feelgood music.“I know that our time on this planet is finite,” he says “and you know what, I want to spend the rest of my le making really great dance music. When I was producing Eric Clapton one day he came out of the studio and said to me that he was gonna play blues for the rest of his le. I said ‘Eric, you mean to tell meI come see a Clapton show I’m not gonna hear Sunshine of Your Love  Or any of those Cream and Blind Faith cool songs ’ And he said ‘no, you’re not gonna get that again, because I’m not going to play it again.’ I went home and thought about it for a bit and I said, ‘well, hell,Eric Clapton is gonna play blues for the rest of his le, I’m gonna play dance music for the rest of my le. Right! I just wanna play music for ever.“Not that I think I’m Eric Clapton, but you know,you’ve put in all this time, you have the right to decide what you want to do and I decided that I like to make music that makes people happy, makes people want to dance. It really feels good to me to see people express themselves through motion.”Speaking of dancing, as a legendary exponent of dance music, what does Rodgers consider to be his hottest move  How would he wow one night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco  Rumba and Tango, Latin Hustle, too, Yowsah, Yowsah… “I have no idea,” he says and laughs. “I don’t consider myself a good dancer any more, because I was actually a serious dancer. I was actually a ballet dancer in another le. Not many people know that, but it’s true. Around the time I was working with Sesame Street when I was  or , and I took it very seriously for a while. Then I just started gigging a lot more and I didn’t have time to practise and ballet you gotta practise just as seriously as you practise music.” As for the upcoming tour, Chic fans can expect to hear the old favourites alongside some of the new album because Rodgers knows his crowd and after playing the festival circuit with Glastonbury and Coachella last year, he’s also conscious a lot of the audience will be hearing them for the first time. “At our shows I ask people to raise their handsthey’re seeing Chic for the first time, and we’re averaging about  per cent first timers. This is amazing to me! Especially since we’ve played the UK so much. I’m like Jesus, everybody has seen us! But no, more than half the crowd will raise their hands and that’s cool.”Rodgers may have four decades in the business but he’s still an innovator and already at Abbey Road has been the first to shoot a video there and has more plans to move and shake the legendary studio.“Abbey Road’s amazing,” he says. “They’re allowing me to do everything there, matter of fact, ha! I might re-invigorate my ballet career, have a dance recital there! It’s just incredible. It’s probably one of the most artistic, creative environments I’ve ever been in. I’m making films, doing concerts, even Paul McCartney wound up having a concert there after I came.”Born in New York in  Rodgers didn’t have the easiest start in le. His mother was  when she got pregnant with him and his biological father, Nile Rodgers Senior, a travelling percussionist, moved on. With his mother and step-father both being heroin addicts, Rodgers learned young to be self-reliant. The last time I interviewed him he spoke about how once as a five-year-old he got wedged down the back of the sofa when his parents were out of it and he had to wait for his grandmother to come round to the house and retrieve him. If he could, what would he say to that little boy stuck amid soft furnishings, waiting for someone to realise he was missing  “I’d say, buckle up, it’s going to be a hell of a ride!” He laughs. After learning to play the guitar at  Rodgers figured he could pay rent and landed his first professional job in the Sesame Street band at . But despite their struggles, he’s very close to his family, especially his mother, and is grateful for the legacy of music bequeathed him by his parents. It’s in his bones and has been all his le.“I have music in me, around me, it just swirls in my head all the time. I can’t turn it off as a matter of fact. Oh yeah, I always hear music, all day long. I heard it as a child, and I hear it now,” he says. In was almost inevitable he would make his name in music, from the beginning playing and practising every day. “I wish I could do that now,” he says, “I would give my left arm to be able to do that. Oh, no… you know what I mean.” He laughs. “I just think practising makes me play better, and he quotes the violinist Jascha Heetz, who once said ‘ I don’t practise one day, I know it two days, the critics know it three days, the public knows it.’ His insecure formative years necessitated a work ethic that spurred Rodgers on and brought financial rewards such as the house by the shore in Westport, Connecticut, with the boat moored at the jetty, where he lives today. Apparently alone, but then Rodgers never talks about his relationships. “Yeah, I’m pretty discreet,” he says. And just out of nosiness, because he’s ulged this to me before, and he is the child of a pair of beatnik hippies, does he still like to hang out there naked when he doesn’t have guests  He laughs. “Yeah, of course, why would I change  Old dog new tricks  No.” With his colourful le story, Nile Rodgers The Musical, should be worth the wait, but his much anticipated autobiographical show is still being written and may be another couple of years in the pipeline. Right now he’s got his hands full with the musical he wrote with Jean-Paul Gaultier, entitled Fashion Freak Show, currently wowing the Folies Bergeres in Paris, as well as another musical bound for Las Vegas and provisionally London’s West End. “The Paris show is doing great and the other one is loosely based on disco lestyle stuff and it’s being done by [Steven Hoggett] the choreographer from the Harry Potter show that’s in the West End now.”As to who would play Rodgers in the musical of his le, he’s at a complete loss, sounding surprised at the question.“Oh, I don’t know… I wouldn’t even… I don’t even know,” he says. “That person would have to be a hell of a lot more talented than myself, because they’d have to do a lot of things at an early age that I couldn’t do when I was that age!” He laughs.Compose, perform, produce, act, oh and they’d have to add ballet to the long list of talents now too, know their ballottéfrom their boogie. “Yes, they would.” He laughs. And no, he wouldn’t consider playing himself.Today Rodgers’ mother Beverly has Alzheimer’s, but the two find common love in music and when he visited her last week, as usual they revisited their playlist for le.“She loves everything. My mom is a be-bop junkie... and loves everything from Charlie Mingus to Nina Simone to Miles to The Beatles. The other day we were singing Hey Jude and she knows every single word, even sings the ad libs…” He lts his voice and does his mother doing McCartney’s scat, “Ju-Judy Judy Judy Judy Judy.“She’s amazing.”Rodgers’ own playlist of signicant songs would contain primarily jazz and some of his own tracks, not out of narcissism, but because he rarely gets to hear them. “I only hear my music when I’m playing it and there’s a huge dference between the recorded and performance versions. In performance there’s a lot of improvisation whereas recorded is exactly the same every time. Sometime when I hear the recorded version I go ‘oh my god, I forgot I wrote that part too’. The other day I heard Let’s Dance and forgot how intricate the horn voicings were. I listened to the whole album and thought wow, this is cool.“Let’s Dance was part of Rodgers’ reinvention as a producer, the album that turned his career around after punk kicked in and left disco apparently for dead. Boogie was busted as punk gobbed in its face and Chic, with their soul, RB, funk, glitter and groove were out in the cold. “Durin’ the disco sucks era,” he says, “we couldn’t get anything, no buzz, no one would listen to us. We were just persona non grata. It’s not that the music was bad, it was just we were not flavour of the month. People didn’t like us.”The collaboration with Bowie was to reinvigorate his career and satisfy his love for discovering new sounds. “Up until David’s record I had six failures in a row. I was known for producing disco. But after David I probably had six successes in a row: David Bowie, INXS, Duran Duran, Madonna, then Duran Duran again, then Mick Jagger and David Bowie with Dancing in the Street... yeah I had a clutch.“And collaborating is fun! Not only have you got your own energy to vibe off, but you have other people’s. I love being in Chic but for the last  years I’ve been mainly in the room with brand new people, in other people’s bands.” Looking back over his career Rodgers is hard pushed to nominate an event or song of which he is most proud. “I’m not more proud of Let’s Dance than We Are Family, Get Lucky, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance or Rapper’s Delight.”As he lists the titles, it prompts a muscle memory, the beginnings of a hustle in the hips, a shimmy in the shoulders, so perhaps it’s the longevity of his sound that’s most impressive. Rodgers, however, can’t explain his success. “If I knew the answer to that question, don’t you think every record I’ve put out would be a hit ” he says. “Most of my records are not hits. Most of my records are flops. Only a handful are hits. Well, actually, a big handful....”A very big handful...“Well, yeah, anyway...” he trails off, modest and mellow.Holding his Hitmaker, it’s time for Rodgers to board his flight, with a final word about how much he’s looking forward to the tour. “You know, I really love composing, I love making records, and when we know from the charts that people are listening, there is a joy that we get. “But when you can actually see people having a good time, that feels pretty damn good. There’s nothing like that. It’s wonderful. So... see you in Glasgow for Good Times.” @JanetChristieNile Rodgers  Chic kick off their UK arena tour at The SSE Hydro Glasgow on  December.

a single customs territory,” he said.Read more: Brexit: Theresa May wins support of cabinet for draft EU orce dealThere would be a new agreement on fisheries and sectoral agreements in transport and energy.The future relationship would also cover justice, security and foreign policy co-operation.He indicated it could be possible to agree the final trade deal within the transition period, due to expire at the end of  -

Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing. The bans, which were pretty lenient in any case, should stay. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"16 murrayston lerwick ","story":"OFFERS OVER £, Murrayston has recently been extended and completely renovated to a high standard providing a modern two bedroomed house with high quality fittings throughout.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"meet donald the new animated face of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local businessman from Skye has created an animated character with the aim of providing useful information to visitors to the island.Donald from Skye is an animated character and the star of a short film about the island.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement was the best that could be negotiated and it was for the Cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks. The choices before us were dficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop, but the collective decision of Cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration. This is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead. These decisions were not taken lightly but I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest. When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear: this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all. I know that there will be dficult days ahead. This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny, and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable. But the choice was this deal, which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country, or going back to square one with more ision, more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum. It is my job as Prime Minister to explain the decisions that the government has taken and I stand ready to do that, beginning tomorrow with a statement in Parliament. If I might end by just saying this: I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest. And I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.

The teachers set up the cheery morning activity to encourage positive interactions between the youngsters.For the past week the  pupils have been choosing which greeting they would like from a list on the classroom door. They simply pointed to it and their teachers Louise Weir and Lorraine Hutton give them that greeting - a fist-pump, high-five or hug.But now the pupils are fetting in on the act, with a dferent child being chosen to stand and give classmates their greeting of choice. Principal Jillian Wallace says the school learned about the greeting system from a school in the United States and decided to give it a try.\"Every morning our two P teachers always stood outside their classroom to say good morning to the children by name and asked them to say it back to them,\" she said.\"P is all about friendship and every child feeling safe, loved and welcome as soon as they enter their classroom. \"Sometimes with Ps the teachers are like their mummies by coming up and giving them a wee hug. \"So they drew up the chart and got the ball rolling last week, but soon the children were askingthey could be the greeters instead. Since the start of this week, a dferent child has been chosen to be the greeter to every other child. However, Mrs Weir and Mrs Hutton are still available for their morning greeting as usual. A heart-warming video posted on the schools Facebook page shows the children starting their day with a smile by greeting each other in fun ways.It has already been viewed more than , times.Ms Wallace says the new system is proving to be a huge hit with staff and students, as well as parents.\"We have our greeting time every morning,\" she said. \"The person who is the greeter changes each day on our job chart.\"There have been a few fist-pumps, lots of high-fives, but mostly the pupils are hugging it out. \"The excitement this has generated has been great and it is so funny, but lovely to watch, in the mornings. \"The pupils seem to really love our new greeting time every morning. \"Our Ps are definitely feeling loved and cared about, which is the most important thing.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"creating waves haunting image by belfast telegraphs kevin scott makes headlines","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The DUP will owe an apology and an explanation to the people who voted for them on the basis of More votes. More seats. More influence. More for Northern Ireland.\"Well what exactly were they doing with their influence \"A stark example is that Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules which includes VAT and excise in respect of goods and state aid rules, so rather than the prospect of being the best of both worlds, this would restrict any potential opportunity.\"Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle ONeill accused the DUP of using \"reckless language\" and added: \"The backstop is the only insurance policy we have. This has been a mess, a debacle. There is no good to come from Brexit. There is no magic deal sitting waiting to be done.\"My message to Theresa May is simple and clear. We, the four main pro-Remain parties, speak for the majority of people in the north. The DUP do not speak for the majority.\"We need to protect our economy and that is about staying in the Customs Union, the single market. That is about the backstop being permanent, there unless or until something better comes along.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MLA called on Arlene Foster and the DUP to \"cut the hysteria\" and \"act on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland\".Mr Eastwood said: \"The reaction to a reported Brexit deal by the DUP is both flippant and irrational.\"I would remind Arlene Foster that her first priority is to defend political stability and the economic future of our people here. Its time for cool heads, not kneejerk reactions.\"The best Brexit deal is no Brexit at all but this draft agreement seeks to protect Ireland from a hard border. There is a proper backstop that protects citizens and businesses here.\"The Good Friday Agreement is protected, including the principle of consent. Unionists should be comfortable that there will only be constitutional change when a majority votes for it. This agreement is about protecting and enhancing our economy and protecting our peace process.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long also said while she is relieved a potential agreement between the EU and UK is closer, there remains no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit.Mrs Long said Alliances preference remained a Peoples Vote on the deal.\"We are relieved there is a potential agreement between the EU and UK on a Withdrawal Agreement, including a backstop which meets the conditions set out in Joint Report from December  and which is supported by representatives of the majority of people in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"The backstop is not a threat to the constitutional position here. Rather it is an insurance policy based on existing precedents, and helping us to better survive Brexit.\"However, there is nothing to celebrate because there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit. The backstop is a last resort safety net, the bare minimum to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border. But only as insurance against a much worse fate.

This included being told he would be temporarily redeployed and could face disciplinary action.With most officers in the ARU being male, they added that enforcing the ban discriminated on the grounds of gender.The PSNI may now be forced to carry out an audit of all the relevant breathing masks.A lawyer for the PSNI accused the claimant of \"making this up as he goes along\" and said the new evidence was an attempt to distract the tribunal . \"Its unacceptable at this stage to introduce this attack,\" she said.The employment judge on the  called it \"less than satisfactory to introduce it at this late stage\".The constables legal team said they only became aware of the issue on Tuesday, after a sergeant giving evidence told them the filter on his own breathing mask was five years out of date.After checking, the constable said his masks filter also expired around .\"We will be pursuing our application for additional evidence to be produced,\" the constables lawyer said.\"The canisters and filters were out of date and therefore we would seek to argue as a consequence this is entirely relevant to the proportionality of discrimination case thats advancing.\"You make the case my client needs to be clean-shaven because of health and safety,\" he added.\"The police havent even been ensuring these things are in date... it shows a major flaw in the consultation process and undermines the decision to enforce the policy against men in this unit.\"On Tuesday the tribunal was told that a police officer would need a moustache \"like a walrus\" to interfere with the breathing masks.The remarks were made by businessman Richard Gates, the director of a UK company that sells safety equipment.The PSNIs corporate appearance and protective equipment policy was introduced at the start of this year, following consultation with a range of stakeholders including the Police Federation, the organisation that represents rank and file officers.On Tuesday the constable accused the federation of being \"asleep at the wheel\" when it backed the policy.He added that many officers were unhappy with the new rules and had not been properly consulted.The case was adjourned until February ."},{"url":null,"title":"listen pilots report multiple ufo sightings in irish airspace investigation underway","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit draft agreement: Read entire  page document Both the UK and EU will \"use their best endeavours\" to achieve a future trade agreement by July  - six months before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, said the Commission.Should this not be possible, the UK and EU could jointly agree to extend the transition period.Alternatively, they could introduce a \"backstop\" arrangement from January , establishing a \"single EU-UK customs territory\" to apply until a new trade deal is implemented, covering all goods except fishery and aquaculture products.Northern Ireland would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring Britain to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections.Below is a fact sheet produced by the European Commission on Northern Ireland.Protocol on Ireland and Northern IrelandBrussels,  November Questions  AnswersWhat has been agreed on Ireland and Northern Ireland The EU and UK negotiators have agreed in full on the terms of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.The Protocol includes all the provisions on how the so-called “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would work. This forms part of the overall Withdrawal Agreement and will apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole or in part, by any subsequent agreement. Both the EU and the UK will use their best endeavours to conclude and raty a subsequent agreement by  July .As part of the Protocol, a single EU-UK customs territory is established from the end of the transition period until the future relationship becomes applicable. Northern Ireland will therefore remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK with no tarfs, quotas, or checks on rules of origin between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK[].The Protocol also sets out the UKs commitment to no diminution of rights as set out in the Good FridayAgreement , and provides for the continuation of the Common Travel Area arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. It ensures that the necessary conditions for continued North-South cooperation are maintained, and preserves the Single Electricity Market on the island of Ireland.This agreement addresses in full the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. It is the insurance policy that guarantees that, whatever the circumstances, there will be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and it will protect the Good FridayAgreement  in all its dimensions, North-South cooperation, and the all-island economy. How will the backstop work If an agreement on the future EU-UK relationship is not applicable by  December , the EU and the UK have agreed that a backstop solution will apply until such a time as a subsequent agreement is in place.Alternatively, the UK may, before  July , request an extension of the transition period. Such a request would be dealt with under article  of the Withdrawal Agreement and must therefore be agreed by the Joint Committee.In the scenario where the \"backstop solution\" would apply, this would mean the following in practice:There will be a single EU-UK customs territory. This will avoid the need for tarfs, quotas or checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK.The EU and the UK have agreed on a set of measures to ensure that there is a level playing field between the EU and the UK.The Unions Customs Code , which sets out, inter alia, the provisions for releasing products into free circulation within the EU, will continue to apply to Northern Ireland. This will ensure that Northern Irish businesses will not face restrictions when placing products on the EUs Single Market.The UK in respect of Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules that are related to the EUs Single Market and indispensable for avoiding a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. Why do you need a backstop The United Kingdom has decided to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union. Both the EU and the UK have committed to avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and both Parties intend to solve this first and foremost through a future agreement.The UK has also committed to respecting the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union – and Irelands place in it.Given that negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship will only be conducted during the transition period, the EU and the UK have agreed to include a legally operational backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, which guarantees that no hard border s – whatever the circumstances. This was agreed in the Joint Report in December  and reiterated by Prime Minister Theresa May in her letter to President Tusk in March , through which the UK government committed to have a legally operative backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. How long will the backstop apply for The aim of the Protocol is not to create a permanent relationship between the EU and the UK. The EU and the UK have committed that they will use their best endeavours to conclude and raty an agreement by  July  which would replace the backstop as contained in the Protocol, in whole or in part. Is there any review mechanism foreseen  Can the EU or the UK ask to stop applying the backstop in whole or in part If at any time after the transition period, the EU or the UK considers that this Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary, it may noty the other party, setting out its reasons. The Joint Committee [as established in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement] will consider the notication and may seek an opinion from institutions created by the Good FridayAgreement . Following discussions in the Joint Committee, the EU and the UK may decide jointly that the Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives. What is the “Single Customs Territory” The EU and the UK have today agreed that a single EU-UK customs territory will apply from the end of the transition period until such a time as a subsequent agreement becomes applicable. This single customs territory will comprise of the customs territory of the UnionNo   and the customs territory of the United Kingdom.This means that:the UK will align the tarfs and rules applicable to its customs territory to the Unions external tarfs and rules of originthere will therefore be no tarfs, quotas and checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK, with the exception of fishery and aquaculture productsboth the EU and the UK have agreed on a series of measures ensuring a level playing fieldthe UK will harmonise its commercial policy with the EUs common commercial policy to the extent necessary for the ing of the single customs territory. Under no circumstances can the UK apply a lower customs tarf to its customs territory than the EU Common Customs Tarf for any good imported from any third country or apply dferent rules of origin.The Union shall apply its trade defence policy and Generalised System of Preferences to both parts of the single customs territory it shall consult the UK on any measures or actions which it considers taking. What “level playing field” measures have been agreed The UK has committed to a level playing field based on open and fair competition between the EU and the UK given the establishment of the single customs territory with no tarfs, quotas and checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK. The economic interconnectedness of the UK and the EU as well as the UKs geographic proximity to the EU are key elements to take into account when regulating the proper ing of open and fair competition in the single customs territory.The Protocol binds the UK to substantive rules, based on international and EU standards. Apart from competition rules, it is based on the principle of non-regression from the current levels of protection under international and EU standards. State aidThe United Kingdom has committed to apply EU state aid rules, in a way that is dynamically aligned to the development of those rules in the EU.For aid granted by the UK that affects trade between Northern Ireland and the EU, the Commission will continue to enforce State aid rules directly as part of the backstop solution. The Court of Justice of the EU also remains competent in this respect.For State aid granted by the UK affecting trade flows only between the rest of the UK and the EU, the UK will set up an independent enforcement authority, which will work in close cooperation with the Commission. UK courts will supervise the independent enforcement authority. The Commission will have legal standing before UK courts and the right to intervene in cases.The Withdrawal Agreement ensures close cooperation between the Union and the UK. The UK state aid authority will regularly consult with the Commission. A Joint Committee will allow both Parties to discuss matters of interest and seek commonly acceptable solutions to disagreements. In case no mutually agreed solution can be found, interim measures and an arbitration system are foreseen in case of unresolved conflicts. CompetitionThe EU and the UK acknowledge that anti-competitive business practices and concentrations of undertakings have the potential to distort the ing of markets and undermine the benefits of trade.In this light, the EU and the UK agree that certain agreements between undertakings, the abuse of dominance by undertakings, and certain concentrations of undertakings must be prohibited in so far as they affect trade between the EU and the UK.The EU and the UK commit to ensuring that their respective competition laws effectively enforce these agreed rules. More concretely, the UK commits to ensure that administrative and judicial proceedings are available in order to permit the effective and timely action against violations of competition rules, and provide for effective remedies. In case of disputes about whether the UK complies with these commitments, dispute settlement through arbitration is available. TaxationThe UK has committed to implementing the principles of good governance in the area of tax, as recently agreed by the Council. These include global standards on transparency and exchange of information, fair taxation and OECD-BEPS standards. It will continue to apply its domestic law which transposes the EU Directives on the exchange of information on taxation, anti-tax avoidance rules and Country-by-Country-Reporting by credit institutions and investment firms. Moreover, the UK reaffirms its commitment to curb harmful tax measures as defined in the EU Code of Conduct.The implementation of this commitment will be addressed by the Joint-Committee. EnvironmentThe EU and the UK have committed to maintain the current level of environmental protection. Both Parties have committed not to lower the EUs existing environmental standards in key areas such as industrial emissions, air quality targets, nature and bioersity protection and environmental impact assessments. The UK will abide by key environmental principles, such as the \"polluter pays\" and the precautionary principle. Furthermore, the Joint Committee will - based on existing EU standards - lay down specic minimum commitments on issues such as pollution, sulphur in marine fuel and use of best available techniques governing industrial emissions.The EU and the UK have also agreed to take the necessary measures to meet their respective commitments to international agreements to address climate change, including the Paris Agreement. Finally, the UK will implement a system of carbon pricing that is at least as effective as the EU Emission Trading Scheme for greenhouse emission allowances.The UK has committed to ensuring the effective enforcement of such common standards in its law, regulations and practices and to set up a new independent body with the task of monitoring, reporting, overseeing and enforcing these commitments. The new independent authority will be able to receive complaints and conduct own-initiative inquiries and bring legal action before a domestic court for remedial action. In this context, the UK has committed to effective administrative and judicial proceedings which will give the right to authorities and members of the public to seek effective remedies and obtain sanctions that are effective, proportionate, dissuasive and deterrent. Labour and social protectionA non-regression provision also applies to labour and social protection standards. The EU and the UK have committed not to reduce their common level of protection provided by their laws, regulations and practices as a result of the implementation of Union law and ratied international conventions, such as the International Labour Organisation conventions and the Council of Europes Social Charter.This includes provisions in relation to fundamental rights at work, such as non-discrimination and equal pay, occupational health and safety, fair working conditions and employment standards, and social rights related to restructuring of companies.The UK will ensure effective enforcement through existing domestic authorities and an effective system of labour inspections. The UK has also committed to effective administrative and judicial proceedings. How will these “level playing field” measures be enforced The enforcement of State aid and competition rules is outlined above.The maintenance of the same level of social and environmental protection will be subject to dispute resolution in the Joint Committee. Disputes on the effectiveness of the UKs monitoring and enforcement of the common standards can, in addition, be brought to arbitration.In taxation, an infringement by the UK of applying the domestic legal rules which transpose EU tax directives covered by the Agreement will be subject to judicial dispute settlement with the possibility of sanctions.The Union will be able to adopt unilateral measures either under the Agreement or on the basis of Union law, and in line with international commitments. These measures may include the possibility to temporarily suspend obligations in the case of non-compliance with an arbitration ruling, safeguards or rebalancing measures , the listing of uncooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes, or action for health and environmental protection in line with international commitments . How can you include a UK-wide customs union in the Withdrawal Agreement  Is it not part of the future relationship The Withdrawal Agreement under Article  can wind down or phase out existing situations or it can provide a bridge to the future relationship.This means that the Withdrawal Agreement may include elements that form the basis on which arrangements in the future relationship are built. The Protocol is therefore only intended to apply temporarily, unless and until a subsequent EU-UK agreement is put in place. Will Northern Ireland be in a dferent customs territory to the rest of the United Kingdom No. Northern Ireland will form part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK, which forms a single customs territory with the EU.However, under the backstop and in order to avoid a hard border, Northern Ireland businesses can place products on the EUs internal market without restriction. Placing goods on the internal market that come from outside of Northern Ireland requires that the processes provided for in the Union Customs Code will have to be applied. Will fisheries be included in the “Single Customs Territory” Arrangements on fisheries will be negotiated as part of the overall future partnership. The EU and the UK will use their best endeavours to agree on a fisheries and aquaculture agreement by  July . An essential condition for this single customs territory to cover fisheries and aquaculture products will be to agree between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities. We have shared objectives to ensure fishing at sustainable levels and promote resource conservation Will Northern Ireland remain aligned to the rules and regulations of the EU  Will Northern Ireland have to apply the EUs Customs Code In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and to ensure that Northern Irish businesses can place products on the EUs Single Market without restriction, it will be necessary for the UK in respect of Northern Ireland to maintain specic regulatory alignment with the EU, as has been agreed between the EU and the UK in the December  Joint Report.This means that Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU rules that are indispensable for avoiding a hard border, namely:legislation on VAT and excise in respect of goodslegislation on goods standardssanitary rules for veterinary controls rules on agricultural production marketingstate aid rules.As explained above, the EUs Customs Code will also continue to apply in Northern Ireland within the overall context of the single customs territory between the EU and the UK. Will Northern Ireland remain part of the UKs VAT area Yes, Northern Ireland will remain part of the UKs VAT area, with HMRC remaining responsible for the operation and collection of VAT, and the setting of VAT rates across the UK, in line with the VAT directive. Specically, the UK will ensure that no business is required to pay VAT upfront when moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that accounting for VAT can continue to be done through postponed accounting and VAT s.However, to ensure that Northern Ireland continues to be able to operate the EUs VIES systemand to share data with Ireland, Northern Ireland will be required to remain aligned to EU VAT rules, but only with respect to goods. Will there need to be checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland There will be no need for checks or controls on goods or persons crossing the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. There will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. The Common Travel Area can also continue to . The UK has committed that this will not affect the obligations of Ireland under Union law, in particular with respect to free movement of EU citizens and their family members to, from and within Ireland. What checks will need to take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK In order to ensure that Northern Irish businesses can place products on the EUs Single Market without restriction – and given the island of Irelands status as a single epidemiological area – there would be a need for checks on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland. There would be a need for some compliance checks with EU standards, consistent with risk, to protect consumers, economic traders and businesses in the Single Market.The EU and the UK have agreed to carry out these checks in the least intrusive way possible. The scale and frequency of the checks could be further reduced through future agreements between the EU and the UK.For industrial goods, checks are based on risk assessment, and can mostly take place in the market or at traders premises by the relevant authorities. Such checks will always be carried out by UK authorities.As for agricultural products, already existing checks at ports and airports will need to continue, but will be increased in scale in order to protect the EUs Single Market, its consumers and animal health. Will Northern Irish businesses still have unfettered access to the rest of the UK Nothing in this Protocol prevents unfettered market access for Northern Ireland products in the rest of the UK. Nothing in this text prevents a product originating from Northern Ireland as being considered as a UK good when placed on the market in the rest of the UK. Who will be responsible for implementing and applying the backstop in Northern Ireland The authorities of the United Kingdom will be responsible for implementing and applying the backstop in Northern Ireland. The EU will have the right to obtain information and request control measures. The UK will facilitate any requests made by EU representatives. The practical arrangements for this will be determined by the Joint Committee, following a proposal from the Specialised Committee. How will certication and product approval work in Northern Ireland Where existing EU law provides for the possibility for an authority body in another Member State to issue product approvals certicates, this option should be used by Northern Irish businessesthey want to export to the EU Member States.On the other hand, Northern Irish businesses can rely on authorisation via UK authorities . UK authorities would apply Union law in respect of Northern Ireland, and could decide to make such certicates valid UK-wide.Products from Northern Ireland can continue to be labelled or marketed as UK products throughout the rest of the United Kingdom. Where EU law on goods is concerned, Northern Irish products shall be indicated as \"UK\". A relevant example would be regarding ear tags for live animals. What guarantees does the backstop provide to protect the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union The UK in respect of Northern Ireland will apply the Union customs code and remain aligned to EU rules and standards on goods. Authorisations by UK authorities for products to be placed on the market, as well as technical regulations, assessments, registrations, certicates and approvals issued by UK authorities or bodies in the UK will be valid for Northern Ireland only. If a Northern Irish business wants to place a product on both the Northern Irish market and the EU Single Market, an authorisation from an EU Member State authority or body will be necessary. Will the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice extend to Northern Ireland The Withdrawal Agreement will have direct effect. This means that UK courts will, in practice, apply this agreement, in the same way as they apply EU law today. The European Court of Justice is the ultimate arbiter of EU law. For issues related to EU law concepts outlined in the Withdrawal Agreement, including aspects of the Protocol, the ECJ will remain the ultimate arbiter. For all other areas of the Protocol, the enforcement and dispute resolution arrangements provided in the Withdrawal Agreement will apply. What  does the Protocol contain beyond the \"backstop\" The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland also contains provisions that address a number of other unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, beyond issues related to customs and regulatory matters, most notably:The Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom and its associated rights and privileges will continue to apply in conformity with EU law, in particular on free movement of EU citizens. The UK will ensure that there will be no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good FridayAgreement , including with regard to EU law on non-discrimination. This commitment will be implemented and monitored through dedicated mechanisms.The Single Electricity Market will be maintained on the island of Ireland.North-South cooperation will continue, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as in the areas of energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport. The report will be published shortly. How will the commitment to no diminution of “Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity” as outlined in the Good FridayAgreement  work The UK will remain bound by the obligations it entered into as a co-guarantor to the Good FridayAgreement .The UK has confirmed its commitment to ensure no diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity set out in the Good FridayAgreement. This includes a commitment to no diminution in rights in the area of non-discrimination at the time of or following its withdrawal from the European Union and Annex  lists the existing EU Directives that have been adopted by the European Union in this area. The commitment to no diminution applies further to all rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity concepts set out in the Good Friday Belfast Agreement.Article  of the Protocol provides that the UK will implement this paragraph through dedicated mechanisms. Article  provides that the United Kingdom will continue to facilitate the work of the institutions and bodies established under the Good Friday Belfast Agreement.The United Kingdom will set out further information on its commitments in this respect. Will Irish citizens in Northern Ireland continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens Northern Ireland will no longer be part of the EU, but a great number of people born and raised there will continue to be EU citizens. They will continue to enjoy their rights as Union citizens under the Treaties. Under the Treatythey will in particular continue to enjoy the following rights:non-discrimination on the basis of nationalitymove and reside freely within the EUconsular protection petition the European Parliament and complain to the European ombudsmancontact and receive a response from any EU institution in one of the EUs official languagesaccess European Parliament, European Commission and Council documents under certain conditionsaccess to the EU Civil Service What will happen to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes The EU and the UK are committed to the PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes under the current multi-annual financial framework and to maintaining the current funding proportions for the future programme. The Commission has already proposed the continuation of PEACE and INTERREG for Northern Ireland and the border regions of Ireland beyond  under a single programme PEACE PLUS. It will now be for Member States, with the consent of the European Parliament, to decide on this. What is North South Cooperation and how will it be protected in the context of the UKs withdrawal   Cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good FridayAgreement and is essential for achieving reconciliation on the island of Ireland.In implementing the Protocol, the conditions necessary for continued North-South Cooperation will be maintained in a range of areas including the environment, health, agriculture, transport, education, tourism, energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport. The protocol recognises that, in full respect of Union law, new arrangements building on the provisions of the Good Friday Belfast Agreement in these and in other areas of North-South cooperation, can continue to be made on the island of Ireland.Both parties have recognised that the UKs departure from the EU gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North South Cooperation. In this context, the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland, as provided for in other Articles of this Protocol, is an essential precondition to protecting North South Cooperation. [] Fisheries and aquaculture products are not within the scope of the single customs territory, see below.  "},{"url":null,"title":"civil servants told to stop including dup in brexit emails as partnership with conservatives crumbles","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That is the fundamental red line.”The critical stumbling block has been over what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republicno trade deal is secured by the end of the Brexit transition period in December , with Brussels having wanted the north to stay in a customs union with the EU to keep the border open.Under the “backstop” arrangement said to be in the draft text, the whole UK would remain in a customs arrangement with the EU instead – a condition sought by Ms May – until a future deal is secured, though there would be deeper provisions for Northern Ireland on customs and regulations, something the DUP find unpalatable.A review mechanism is also understood to be part of the text, which would determine when the UK would leave the backstop arrangement, but it is unclear whether it meets the demands of Brexiteers – including some in the cabinet – who want Britain to be able to unilaterally walk away."},{"url":null,"title":"has theresa may got the numbers for her brexit plan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Arlene Foster has said the Prime Minister is “fully aware of our position and concerns” over Northern Ireland being treated dferently to the rest of the UK.It seems unlikely the Scottish National Party would support the deal given Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement would be “a bad one for Scotland”.There is ision within the Conservative party too, with the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, claiming it has  MPs ready to vote against what it sees as Mrs May’s capitulation to Brussels.Opponents suggest the number would be whittled down under a concerted offensive of arm-bending by the Tory whips, so it may finally be considerably less.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  This means Mrs May could need to find up to  votes – but perhaps more realistically somewhat less – from where.So the Prime Minister may well need to extend an olive branch to Labour, which also has its own isions between those like Chuka Umunna who oppose Brexit, those like Caroline Flint who support it reluctantly because their constituents voted to leave, or those like Kate Hoey who are ardent Brexiteers.The question is how many of Jeremy Corbyn’s MPs are prepared to defy him and support the Prime Minister, reasoning that a no-deal Brexit, which they fear could bring about an economic disaster, would be a worse outcome."},{"url":null,"title":"is theresa mays brexit plan worst in history some people have other ideas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money. However, it was Scotstown who had a sting in their tail and they held on for victory.It was a similar story for Bredagh in their Ulster Club IFC quarter-final in Cootehill on Saturday where they were beaten - to - by Cavan champions Mullahoran. Jody Gormleyrsquos charges were desperately unlucky not to progress and were pipped at the post by a goal in the last minute of added time.Elsewhere, Downpatrick beat An Riocht - to - in the ACFL Division  relegation play-off at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle.The Hoops just about held on in dficult playing conditions as An Riocht refused to go go down without a fight.St Johnrsquos got the better of Ballymartin in their ACFL Division  relegation play-off and their - to - win was just reward for a determined display.The only negative thing for St Johnrsquos was the news that manager Benny Corrigan stood down after the game..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch bypass scheme edges closer  ","story":"THE planned Ballynahinch bypass scheme is moving into the contract stage, Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Cathy Mason has confirmed.The partyrsquos Slieve Croob spokesperson has received confirmation from the Department for Infrastructure that work has commenced on drawing up contract documentation for the scheme.She said: ldquoFollowing the decision by the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard to commence work on the Ballynahinch bypass in December , officials from DfI have been working diligently through the ious legal stages to ensure the long awaited bypass scheme can commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed earlier this year.Ms Mason added: ldquoThis has allowed the Department to now move ahead with preparation of the contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity  ","story":"A RECENT fundraising event in aid of Zambian businessman Charles Mwanda has raised pound,.The St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick was the venue in September for a night of musical entertainment organised by Sr Mary Delargy, a missionary sister from the town who has helped dozens of African children out of poverty and into professions over recent years.When Sr Mary worked in Zambia, Charles was her administrative assistant and she says the fundraising concert was not about giving him a hand out, but a hand up to continue with his business and employ a number of local people.The key reason for the September fundraiser was to generate enough money to allow Charles to purchase a generator so he could power his car wash business.Sr Mary worked in Zambia and during this period Charles was her assistant, helping her with the young people she was working with aged between  and .She had helped Charles get his business going through donations but there was a problemwith the power supply which is intermittent. To help keep the business going, he required a generator which is now in place.Sr Mary explained that due to regular power outages, electricity is only available from pm to am, therefore no business can operate during daylight hours.She said the recent concert at the St Patrick Centre raised pound, with an additional pound raised via subsequent donations.ldquoThe generator has been bought and installed and is making real dference to the business, a delighted Sr Mary confirmed this week.ldquoCharles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity of people he will never meet. He now employs five young men and sustains his own family with the proceeds of the business.Sr Mary has thanked everyone who made the recent concert such a success, in particular, the Director and staff at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and the talented Stephen Smyth and his band who provided the the entertainment.Thanks were also extended to Frenchrsquos for providing the delicious supper, Downe Travel, Connollyrsquos and the Knights of St Columbanus for sponsorship.St Mary added: ldquoThank you to all those who attended the .

For others, the staple was numerous laps of the lake or repeated jaunts to Castlewellan and back.Following a Mexican stand-off in the Coffee Dock two weeks earlier, Dee Murray declared that East Downrsquos top seven would beat Newcastlersquos Magnicent Seven. There was a lot at stake to see who would win the battle of the coaches. With excitement building, the pundits predicted that there was a real possibility that the Magnicent Seven could all break the magical three hour barrier.Running his second marathon in six weeks , Patrick Higgins went through half way exactly on : pace. He ran out of juice in the latter stages and cruised home for a time of : ndash a great achievement when added to his : in Berlin.Second man home for the second year in a row was Frank Cunningham. Starting with a spark in his eyes, the Burrenreagh bachelor stood with the big boys at the start line and held his rightful place at the front taking a massive  minutes and eight seconds off his time from last year, running an incredible ::, breaking the three in style and with plenty to spare.It was little wonder that he made the front page of the Irish Independent the following day, with copies sold out by am at every shop within  miles of Dublin.

Backed by his loyal Ardglass supporters who travelled down by the busload, it is little surprise the quiet gentleman has the loudest fans.Irish international Sineacutead Murtagh is the newest addition to the sub three hour club. After making her international mountain running debut in Andorra six weeks earlier, Murtagh can now add her sub three membership card next to the framed Irish vest on the mantelpiece. Murtagh also claimed the Newcastle  Districtrsquos female marathon record by a mere eight seconds which Mari Troeng set only six weeks earlier and was unanimously awarded the woman of the match award.With five runners under three hours, this was most successful marathon in recent club history.Almost, but alas still not quiteDublin  was season eight of Noel Gallagherrsquos journey to break the three.

Her extremely consistent training was undoubtedly her greatest strength and this instilled a sense of self-belief that enabled her to thrive.Richard Rodgers followed close behind in :, taking six minutes of his London time. Despite injuries late in the summer, coach Rodgers is like a fine wine, getting better with age.Given that a few weeks before the event he was no more than a lsquopossible maybersquo he put into practice the lessons he teaches athletes about determination, perseverance and resilience.After dining out on minimal portions of a leg of goldfish the night before, lsquoButcherrsquo Kelly ran on little miles in the bank and little food in the tank.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many will read his words as being a clear reference to paramilitary violence and intimidation used during the Troubles in Northern Ireland by terrorist groups.“Politicians set the tone. In this time of ision and rancour we must debate with respect and care.”Mr Wilson is well known for his robust and outspoken approach.In January, he expressed regret for calling Taoiseach Leo Varadkar “a nutcase”.Last month, he branded Mr Varadkar “despicable, low and rotten”.try catch     .               ..

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

Mrs Prancersquos husband, Clive, died at  from kidney cancer at the Marie Curie Cardf and Vale Hospice in August , and Mrs Prance said the support she and her husband received was invaluable.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Arlene Foster has said the Prime Minister is ldquofully aware of our position and concerns over Northern Ireland being treated dferently to the rest of the UK.It seems unlikely the Scottish National Party would support the deal given Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement would be ldquoa bad one for Scotland.There is ision within the Conservative party too, with the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, claiming it has  MPs ready to vote against what it sees as Mrs Mayrsquos capitulation to Brussels.Opponents suggest the number would be whittled down under a concerted offensive of arm-bending by the Tory whips, so it may finally be considerably less.This means Mrs May could need to find up to  votes ndash but perhaps more realistically somewhat less ndash from where.So the Prime Minister may well need to extend an olive branch to Labour, which also has its own isions between those like Chuka Umunna who oppose Brexit, those like Caroline Flint who support it reluctantly because their constituents voted to leave, or those like Kate Hoey who are ardent Brexiteers.The question is how many of Jeremy Corbynrsquos MPs are prepared to defy him and support the Prime Minister, reasoning that a no-deal Brexit, which they fear could bring about an economic disaster, would be a worse outcome..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Has Theresa May got the numbers for her Brexit plan  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His trophy for the Masters class success was a sword. David said: “I’ve been training from  years old on and off and decided to start competing six years ago. I held quite a few titles at the Northern Ireland Fitness Model Associationshows then started competing at the British National Bodybuilding Federationshows, where I have placed second three years in a row in the masters over  class. My goal is to become the masters champ at the BNBF.” Of why he started bodybuilding he said: “I started because I was a skinny kid and wanted to change my appearance, so my father took me to a gym one day and when I lted the weights for the first time I knew it was for me.“I always wanted to compete but never thought I was good enough till one day I said what the hell and went for it, so looked into shows where it was all natural athletes.” He added: “For shows you need to be strict on what you eat, when you eat and what types of food you eat and calories per day as it helps to hold onto muscle but, at the same time, you want to bring your body fat down to get great condition and for your muscles to be sitting out.“I have an amazing coach James Melville from the Compound Room, Lisburn, who I work with very closely. He does all my prep for shows. “I do all my training at Fitness Factory gym, Lurgan. “Leading up to shows I put my body through a lot of stress where I will be training two to three times a day six days a week, working on all body parts.” Police Ombudsman appeals for witnesses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"After Christmas he’ll be getting ready to compete at the BNBF British qualiers in Belfastwhere he’ll be aiming to win the masters title and qualy for the British finals in Liverpool.He said: “It would be a dream come true to get top five against the best UK national bodybuilders.” And of his recent successes: “I still really can’t believe it, It hasn’t really sunk in properly as going over I didn’t expect to place or was even happy to crack the top five. “I really can’t believe it, I still think it’s all a dream.”David thanked his family and friends for their support and said his partner Mandy “has been by my side with amazing support”.He added: “Without Mandy and kids Megan, Ben and Cody it would not have been as special, as it was a family holiday and for the first two days I had to watch them eat all the nice foods.

The deal sets out a -year plan to grow the economy, boost jobs and tourism, increasing skills, encouraging investment and developing infrastructure. Six Northern Ireland councils are working in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Northern Ireland Office, Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Treasury as well as Queen’s and Ulster Universities, and Further Education Colleges to move forward with the City Deal plans.Mr Buckley said: “Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon’s absence from what has been described as a once in a generation opportunity is astounding.”He added: “I am stunned ABC appears to have missed an incredible opportunity through Belfast Region City Deal. Just last month the council’s chief executive Roger Wilson was quoted as saying: ‘We are proactively developing a high-quality business infrastructure, boosting skills in the region, supporting economic development and promoting the borough as being very much open for business.’ “City Deal ticks all of those boxes and more, and our borough’s vital strategic location would surely have made it the ideal location to benefit from the City Deal bid. The fact that councils as far away as Newry and Mourne have secured their place at the Belfast region city deal table, gives me even more cause for concern as to why Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon are missing. “Just last week ABC council announced it had written to the Chancellor alongside Mid-Ulster and Fermanagh and Omagh councils to ask for a Treasury backed scheme, and Northern Ireland’s rd city deal. This leads me to ask why theyare not included in the Belfast city deal, when others were.“You just have to look at our neighbours to see what is being outlined. The Newry Southern Relief Road, for example, will be an invaluable addition to the area. In County Antrim, Carrickfergus is earmarked for around £m of investment in its town centre. My constituency of Upper Bann is crying out for similar investment, and was geographically and economical well placed to be included.”A spokesperson for the Council said ABC Council “set out its plans to explore mechanisms for a Growth Deal in collaboration with Fermanagh  Omagh District Council and Mid Ulster District Council in a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond. “We believe that working with our two neighbouring councils – which represent one quarter of Northern Ireland’s population – we have a strong chance of securing a Growth Deal which will work to boost economic growth and deliver a step-change to the future prospects of the collective area. It will work alongside the Belfast City Region Deal and the proposed Derry Londonderry City Deal to bolster the NI economy as a whole.”Police investigate war memorial incident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Oly-1.jpg","title":"titanic quarter office scheme out for tender","story":"Posted on Tuesday  November  by Ulster Business A huge office scheme for the Titanic Quarter has taken a step forward as the development is put out for tender.
