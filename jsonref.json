The photographs, captured by photographer and explorer Gianluca Chiodini, 41, from Rome, Italy, only hint to the New Guinea tribe\u0027s dark, violent history (Pictured: Young members of the Asmat tribe)         The Asmat people spent centuries hunting down their enemies and removing their heads, sometimes transforming their decapitated skulls into pillows (Pictured: A child in a sea shell hat)         The tribe is said to have \u0027officially\u0027 turned its back on headhunting in the 1990s in favour of a quieter, more peaceful life of woodcarving and creating \u0027legendary\u0027 handicrafts         \u0027I have always really wanted to go to Papua, in particular the Asmat area,\u0027 said Mr Chiodini, who works as a manager for an energy company\u0027Asmat handicraft is legendary of course and a big reason for my visit. Another was the beautiful body and facial decorations on display but most of all I yearned to explore a tribe which is close to world limits\u0027.The tribe, which still remains relatively isolated from the modern world, formed a community organisation, the Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat, in 2000.  This represents the needs and interests of the tribe, and promotes self-reliance, self-governance, and sustainable economic development.The Asmat people became infamous in 1961 after they were accused of the murder of Michael Rockefeller, who was the son of then-New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.              The tribe, which still remains relatively isolated from the modern world, formed a community organisation, the Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat, in 2000 (Left: A group of tribesmen and right: sacred wooden masks)         The tribe did not only hunt for skulls but also worshipped them, and believed that when they killed a man and ate him, they took his power and became him         The heads of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body\u0027You really need to want to go to Asmat, because it takes several days to get there, you need to sleep in tents in their longhouse, to navigate in narrow rivers and they are not that friendly\u0027, said Mr Chiodini.\u0027I knew the Rockefeller story before I got there, I was also a little bit scared because you cannot know what you will face when you arrive in the area.\u0027Officially headhunting ceased in the 1990s. What I can say is that Asmat are relatively isolated and their most important cultural traditions are still strong - you can feel it as you explore the area.\u0027The tribe did not only hunt for skulls, they also worshipped them. The heads of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body.          Two Asmat tribesmen exhale smoke in a small hut while wearing elaborately decorated feathered hats and body paint         Children were also covered in white paint within the tribe, which became infamous for its headhunting practices in the 20th century         Dozens of tribesmen sit crossed legged for a community meeting of the Asmat people, some with white paint across their bodies and heads         A group of tribesmen head across the coastal waters of Papua on their own hand-hewn canoes near to the isolated village         The Asmat people became infamous in 1961 after they were accused of the murder of Michael Rockefeller (Pictured in New Guinea)Skulls that were modified and decorated were then displayed by the Asmat in an honourable place in their homes. The tribe were said to believe that when they killed a man and ate him, they took his power and became him.Each of the thousands of tribesmen was named after someone deceased, or after a killed enemy. It is, however, believed headhunting ceased in the 1990s when Catholic missionaries suppressed the practice.          Pictured: Italian photographer Gianluca Chiodini, 41, who captured the striking photographsTheir biggest alleged scalp was Rockefeller, who had been exploring New Guinea in 1961 in search of treasures to bring home and put on display in New York City.He visited Asmat during the trip - a region he described as \u0027wild and somehow more remote country than what I have ever seen before\u0027 - where he had a pragmatic relationship with the local tribes. But as his boat approached what is now Papua New Guinea on November 19, a sudden gust of wind churned the water and capsized Rockefeller\u0027s boat. Despite being 10 miles from dry land, he attempted to swim to shore.In 2014, Carl Hoffman, a reporter for National Geographic, alleged in his book Savage Harvest that he believed Rockefeller was murdered and eaten by the Asmat people. According to years of research, the Oil Standard heir had managed to make it back to the island but was confronted by a bank of Asmat tribespeople who were fishing the waters.But the tale didn\u0027t stop Mr Chiodini from visiting the area. The photographer recalls speaking to the tribal elders, who were old enough to have partaken in their tribe\u0027s history of cannibalism and headhunting, and being distracted by the notion as he asked the ancient warriors to pose for a photo.\u0027Being able to capture people in their environment and show what life is like in these places is a big part of what I enjoy about travel photography,\u0027 he said.\u0027In other worlds, connecting with locals, even if sometimes just with non-verbal language.

After that summer I started following the English games on TV and as the recent World Cup winners Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa had signed for Spurs, I decided Tottenham was going to be my team. I watched as many games as I could on TV before I finally moved to London in 1993 and was from then on finally able to visit White Hart Lane on a regular basis.I’ve been supporting Tottenham most of my life and seen us in good and bad times. Seen players and managers come and go, and it can be frustrating, even heartbreaking, when they leave for another team. Sometimes it can feel like there’s little loyalty in football. One day you are Spurs, the next day you can go play for a rival. The focus is always on the players and the manager. I was interested in making a project about the fans. The fans never switch allegiances, they are here forever and I felt that needed to be documented and celebrated.I started bringing my camera to the games and photographed the atmosphere on the streets and in the pubs before and after. It ended up growing into an obsession, and after three years I realised that I was beginning to document a piece of our history – the last seasons at White Hart Lane. I decided that our last game at White Hart Lane should be the endpoint of this project. I went to, and photographed, over 100 home and away games between 2013 and 2017.I wanted to capture different generations of fans, the camaraderie, the banter, the songs in the pubs, the madness. Travelling up and down the country and the long away trips in Europe. I wasn’t interested in making a chronological “football fan” book covering all the games with numerous pictures on each page. I wanted the book to have some artistic merit in terms of photography. I am interested in people and I’ve always been more interested in photography that is open-ended, pictures that are suggestive and open to interpretation, rather than pictures that are descriptive.The Arsenal derbies are always memorable, something every fan looks forward to. It’s an early start and you can feel the tension and excitement in the atmosphere all over north London. I also used to love the trips to Upton Park, which are now sadly also part of history. The European away trips are fantastic. There is something special about going abroad with Tottenham. Being in a different country, putting our flags and banners up and taking over a pub with all the familiar faces. The last game at White Hart Lane was emotional and beautiful. When we beat Manchester City away in 2016, when Eriksen scored the winner in the 83rd minute, and of course our 3-1 win against Real Madrid at Wembley, these were all very special moments.There’s something about going to all those games, travelling home and away, which forms bonds between people, and over the past five years I have met so many fantastic characters and heard many Tottenham stories. There is something fascinating about meeting and talking to lifelong fans, those who have been there since the glory days – there’s a real link to the history of the club in their memories. It’s important to memorialise that.I was interested in capturing characters, emotions and expressions and also the dynamics of the group. I kept an instinctive approach throughout and often shot from the hip. Nothing was planned or staged. It was all about capturing those little moments – a feeling that could so often get lost if I’d spent time framing the shots.It definitely helped being a Spurs boy, but you don’t just turn up and get invited in and start taking pictures. In the beginning there were certainly a few people who questioned what I was doing pointing a camera in their face. I knew from the beginning that I had to take my time. It was important for me to get to know people first, find out what they are doing and just go with the flow. It might sound like a cliché, but you can’t make images happen when you want them to – the images will come to you. It’s a little bit like fishing – sometimes you catch something and sometimes you come home empty-handed.I like using my camera as a tool to meet other people. It can help break down boundaries. I always treat everyone with respect – if they didn’t want to be photographed I wouldn’t photograph them. I am always modest and interested in what other people are doing and thinking. I take better pictures when I feel a connection with others. Once you are accepted and you are part of the same dynamic you feel that you belong to something special and it becomes easier to take pictures.Can’t Smile Without You by Martin Andersen is published by AMS and available at https:www.shop.martinandersenproductscant-smile-without-you.

The gentleman in the foreground, Joe Wrenn, organises this group ride every fall in the hilly terrain to the north of the Mississippi delta. I’ve been going for a few years.Trail rides are universal in the American cowboy tradition. In other states you might find thousands of people on a single ride. Here there were about 100 people, many riding, and others, who you can’t see in the photo, on dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles.Most of the delta region is completely flat. Up here, though, are rolling hills, which is where the group gets its name. The ride wasn’t following a trail – part of it was along an old logging road. We had all stopped for a break. People were relaxing, playing music and then, when we started back out, Joe drove the truck up alongside these three horses. I shot I don’t know how many frames. I remember feeling so excited at getting both Joe and the kids on their horses silhouetted against that beautiful, late-afternoon sun bursting through. That is Joe’s grandson on the first horse.Elsewhere, I have photographed a great-grandmother who had just turned 92 – her husband, now deceased, was one of the first cowboys to start organising these rides in the delta. And I’ve photographed little kids, maybe four or five, riding around a horse show.Being a Delta Hill Rider is like being a member of a biker club. They have been riding horses for generations, and they take great pride in passing down the skills – riding, grooming, competing – from one generation to the next. The riders go to R\u0026ampB clubs dressed as cowboys and the DJ will play cowboy songs and zydeco music.My interest started by chance, in December 2016, when I was working as staff photographer at the university in Cleveland, Mississippi. I stumbled across a small group of riders during the annual parade and asked one of the riders if I could come and photograph where they keep their horses. He was excited that somebody was taking an interest. He invited me to a Black Heritage rodeo, which was happening the following month.Meeting the Delta Hill Riders has been life-changing. I grew up in Maine, in a place that was not erse. This was the first time in my life that I developed a deep connection with the African American community. I am really grateful for that. I feel like, if people made the time to get to know neighbours who were different from them, it would relieve a lot of the tension and isive thinking that we have.Trained: Journalism at St Michael’s College, Vermont.High point: “The excitement of getting my first magazine assignment.

It’s contained in one-month of learning, or hived off from the “core curriculum” in the form of optional modules.Why does this matter? A leaked draft of the independent review into the Windrush scandal earlier this year showed one reason. It recommended that all Home Office staff should “learn about the history of the UK and its relationship with the rest of the world, including Britain’s colonial history”.If we were all taught about colonial history in school, we’d learn at a young age that many of the people who came here from colonies and former colonies did so as citizens, not as immigrants. We’d discuss how so-called immigration policies introduced from the 1960s onward were designed to make it more difficult for people of colour to come to this country, and we’d examine the forms of resistance that came with this.In a manner similar to the implementation of the anti-Jewish Aliens Act of 1905, successive governments treated minorities as a threat to the UK. They enacted what the academic Gurminder Bhambra calls “policies of racialisation”. “If we understood that,” she told me, “we wouldn’t just shift the boundary of citizen and migrant to include people from (former) colonies. To say that I’m not a migrant is not a lack of solidarity with those who are migrants ... If we were to accept that I am British, then that would mean that we would have to think differently about migration in the present.”History is not stuck in the past. What we remember, and how, helps us understand who we are. Learning about empire – from the brutal suppression of Kenya’s Mau Mau uprising to WEB Du Bois’ work on colonialism – would mean understanding that colonialists created race and the racial hierarchy to control and govern colonies around the world. Unpicking how and why race was constructed would make for a more sophisticated discussion about racism now and chip away at the idea that this was ever an exclusively “white” country.It might also mean people on either side of the Brexit ide pausing before they demand “we” “take back control” or lament that the UK was a “tolerant” country before the EU referendum.In a sanitised version of history that is spouted by politicians such as Boris Johnson, the UK grew rich not because of exploitation and resource extraction, because of an innate ability to progress. This colonial thinking persists the “backward” became the “underdeveloped”, while the lives and knowledge of some are still considered more important than others.Four billion people are not poor because of some unhappy accident or an inherent failing legacies of colonialism, extractive capitalist economies and racialised hierarchies of power produce poverty. Against a history where supremacy often meant mastering the environment for profit – decimating indigenous communities in the process – it’s not by chance that the climate crisis now impacts those least responsible for it.As part of its race and faith strategy, the Labour party has committed to setting up an Emancipation Education Trust, which would ensure migration, colonialism and this country’s multiracial past are taught in schools. So too would the legacy of slavery, including “how it interrupted a rich and powerful black history which is also British history”.Some regard teaching about colonialism as simply too political, as if the way we tell history now is somehow neutral. Relative quiet in our schools is paired with politicians glorifying empire as its realities are erased nostalgia and amnesia sitting side by side. Britain’s bloody colonial history is weighed up as both good and bad the railways v the Bengal famine. One the UK can take credit for the other is too far in the past to have much to do with “us”. This country is the saviour, never really an oppressor.In this election there is a chance to change this narrative. It’s not about guilt or one-dimensional stereotypes: if histories of exclusion, colonialism and the fierce resistance to much of this were more widely known, it could mean a more nuanced, inclusive understanding of the present.• Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/569c5bf271689ddeb19d8af66d222a7efd8876f5/0_234_4925_2956/master/4925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d74a206523d26d5ad4e59ec3d0ae9c","title":"the tories do have policies they just dont want you to know what they are","story":"A cursory glance through the Tory manifesto would suggest a party bereft of ideas, with little meaningful or relevant to say about the challenges confronting a crisis-stricken society. “Get Brexit done” is their battle cry, so that we can finally talk about the issues that really matter – all the while gliding over the pesky minor detail that it is their leader who has played a pivotal role in making Brexit the issue sucking oxygen out of our political realm. The main parties’ manifestos, up against one another, is surely compelling evidence that – unlike in the 1980s – the left is bubbling with ideas and the Tories are in ideological retreat, sustained only by a wave of rightwing populism and the political polarisation delivered by the 2016 referendum.But it is the emptiness of the Tories’ flimsy document that should alarm us. It is a sign that the Tory right is in the ascendancy, and those deemed “moderate” (so even-handed and sensible that they will happily strip disabled people of their benefits) have been purged. The document gives them free rein to ride roughshod over Britain’s poorest people. Yet the Tories insist that this is all a conspiracy. We are invited to believe that, granted a parliamentary majority, rightwing politicians defined by their ideological fervour will skip a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to implement their lifelong, defining beliefs.This deceit is nothing new for British Conservatism. Let us recall the 1979 Tory manifesto: surely here was the founding ideological document of Thatcherism, setting out the party’s grand masterplan to refashion British society and overturn the postwar consensus established by the 1945 Labour government. It was no such thing. As one political academic puts it, Thatcher’s “government either cleverly concealed the true extent of its liberalising intentions or – more likely – only gained full confidence in the idea of unleashing ‘market forces’ once safely installed at No 10”. Another suggests its commitments were largely “compatible with other postwar Conservative manifestos”, and attempted to counter Labour’s attempts “to portray Mrs Thatcher as a dangerous extremist”.And what about now? Let us consider Dominic Raab, whose rightwing views frighten some of his own colleagues. Here is a man who co-authored a pamphlet arguing that the “current monolith” of the NHS should be “broken up”, while “new nonprofit and private operators should be allowed into the service, and, indeed should compete on price”. Translated into non-wonk speak, this is privatisation. The foreign secretary has also denounced British employment legislation as a “straitjacket” for the economy, favouring instead hire-and-fire rules. And again, another book he co-authored – Raab is nothing if not prolific – alongside fellow cabinet ministers Priti Patel and Liz Truss, denounced British workers as “the worst idlers in the world” and proposed scrapping workers’ rights.As Maya Angelou once said: “When people show you who they are, believe them.” Brexit, for them, is not principally about reconfiguring Britain’s relationship with the EU, but rather scrapping what they call red tape and we call workers’ rights and environmental protections. The same applies to Boris Johnson, who once lambasted the NHS as “top-down monopolistic healthcare” and advocated introducing charges for NHS services. We should heed the words of ex-Conservative prime minister John Major, who declared that “the NHS is about as safe” with Johnson and his colleagues as a “pet hamster would be with a hungry python”. Michael Gove, he suggested, desired to privatise the NHS: and indeed the cabinet minister is the co-author of a book that described the NHS as “no longer relevant in the 21st century”, instead arguing that Britain’s most important institution should be replaced by private healthcare companies.The Tory party should not be accused of a scarcity of ideas, but rather of being dishonest about its intentions. Johnson and his allies know their heartfelt beliefs are not popular with the general public they are also aware that Labour’s domestic policies on public ownership and raising taxes for the rich enjoy widespread support. It is for this purpose that they deploy Brexit as a distraction and so run down the clock with stunts such as picking fights with Channel 4 News. They will do anything to deflect from Labour’s programme and the failure to state their own in detail.There are fundamental differences with 1980s Thatcherism, of course. Back then, the Tories intended to embed a new political consensus by granting a short-term boost to the living standards of a layer of the population, principally through right-to-buy and share ownership. But this was an unsustainable bubble one that built a new social order that condemned the next generation to insecurity and stagnating living standards. It’s a phenomenon I encountered in Stoke-on-Trent at the weekend: a middle-aged woman confessed she had done rather well out of Thatcher, mainly because of right-to-buy. But she spoke of her son, unable to afford to buy his own home, instead paying through his nose to a private landlord and of his girlfriend, who studied for a university degree and has the vast debt to show for it, and is now stuck in a low-paid, low-skilled job. It is the experience of her son’s generation that explains why Tory support has imploded among the young.This time around, there is nothing left to sell, no meaningful short-term bungs to offer. Instead, the Tories rely on an authoritarian rightwing populism to fill the vacuum. Their hope is that this will appeal to working-class voters in Stoke-on-Trent, Doncaster and Bolton whose economic views are rooted firmly on the left. They make sure to keep shtum about their true intentions, believing Brexit demagoguery is a means to deflect from policies that threaten the living standards and rights of leave-supporting voters in the small towns of the Midlands, the north and Wales.And so here is a warning. The Tory manifesto is a blank cheque, not an empty sheet. The Tory rightwingers are ravenous vultures circling over the remnants of Britain’s creaking public realm and hard-won social rights. Their ambitions are not lacking, merely disguised. And if they secure the majority they crave, soon there will be nothing worthwhile left of Britain for them to feast on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

But as those waters have warmed, their numbers have fallen drastically.Tribal leaders in Sitka have long called for better protection of herring, a fish that holds cultural as well as economic significance for the people here. To demand protection of the sac roe herring fishery on which their way of life depends, they are taking the Alaskan government to court.For the subsistence harvesters of sac roe herring in the sound, this decline has been accelerated by what they see as the failure of the government to manage the herring fishery properly. Since 2002, the Sitka Tribe of Alaska (STA) has been appealing to the board of fisheries with proposals to protect the herring population.The scale of the decline was underlined in April, with the cancellation of an annual derby that usually sees hundreds of boats from the North Pacific gather in Sitka before setting sail for two to three days’ fishing. This year, not a single ship left the port and not a single herring was caught.The Sitka tribe, of more than 4,000 people, welcomed cancellation of the derby by Alaska’s department of food and game. But the move doesn’t reverse a decade of decline. While in 2009 the derby had celebrated a record fishing season, by 2018 the Sitka sac roe herring fishery was forced to close early because the herring were too scarce and too small.It was the fourth time in eight years that the herring fishery had shut down early without meeting the quota, following early closures in 2012, 2013 and 2016. In 2018 the department had expected a catch of more than 11,000 tonnes of sac roe herring, but not even 3,000 tonnes were produced, according to its own report.While the commercial industry harvests the eggs from inside the fish once caught, subsistence harvesters set out hemlock branches after the fleet leaves, where herring spawn and lay their eggs. Native Alaskans have been harvesting herring in this way for centuries but, in recent years, they have been pulling up branches bare. They say herring spawn now only cover a fraction of the coastline, and fear is mounting within the Sitka tribe that local stocks are on the verge of collapse.At the heart of the dispute with Alaska’s authorities is the question of whether the herring – which feeds on zooplankton and phytoplankton and is a key food for salmon, seabirds and marine mammals – is designated a forage fish. The STA wants the species to be included on a forage fish management plan, acknowledging its importance in the Alaskan food web.The Sitka tribe also want Alaskan authorities to decrease the size of the herring that can be taken to market in order to protect the species, but say their requests have fallen on deaf ears. Herring return to spawn for up to seven years, each year growing larger depending on conditions in the ocean. It takes a fish at least five years to reach the size and roe maturity that processors want.In 2018, the fisheries board turned down a proposal to reduce the level of the commercial catch, and last December STA launched legal action in the superior court to demand a new management plan for the fishery. The Sitka tribe also want the court to find the actions of the fisheries board department of food and game illegal.A spokesperson for the STA explained the action, saying: “The time is now to ensure that our people have the chance to fulfil their cultural responsibilities, which have been interwoven with the herring since time immemorial, and to fill their freezers. We cannot sit by while the state of Alaska shirks its statutory and constitutional duties to citizens. We demand action by the state.”The trial – the culmination of more than two decades of concern over declining herring for the Sitka tribe – has been set for January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03bcff1adf531ea1ba9d35dd2295f635b8df602b/709_0_2936_1763/master/2936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8286f501f15d11c22d38eeb83a270b7","title":"how hollywood feted the black power movement and fell foul of the fbi","story":"The biopic Seberg tells the tragic story of film star Jean Seberg who – along with Marlon Brando and Jane Fonda – gave money and public support for the Black PanthersHuey P Newton was rowing towards the Cuban coastline in a dinghy with only one oar when it capsized. The leader of the Black Panthers and his girlfriend, Gwen Fontaine, were on the final part of a journey that had been masterminded by the most important production team in the New Hollywood era: Bert Schneider, Bob Rafelson and Steve Blauner (AKA BBS Productions). Five years earlier, the trio had upended the movie industry with Easy Rider. Now they were attempting to do to American life what they had done to Hollywood: brazenly tear up the rulebook and redistribute power.The producers had clandestinely shuttled Newton to Mexico, then convinced a Colombian smuggler – known only as “the Pirate” – to take the black radical, who was on the run after being accused of shooting a 17-year-old sex worker, into Cuban waters. But Newton and Fontaine struggled in the choppy sea, eventually scrambling ashore where they were picked up by the Cuban authorities. Drenched and anonymous to their would-be saviours, it wasn’t the hero’s welcome the Black Panthers leader anticipated. But it might have been BBS’s most audacious production.It was far from the only unlikely connection between New Hollywood and the Black Panthers. In the late 60s and early 70s, dozens of actors, producers and directors would flirt with the revolutionary group – funding them, championing them and chronicling their rise and fall.The story of Newton and Schneider’s shambolic but ultimately successful bromance is on its way to becoming a TV series in the US with the original magazine story written by Joshuah Bearman – the same journalist who recounted the real-life storytale that became the Oscar winner Argo – being adapted into a limited series. Meanwhile, Seberg – the Jean Seberg biopic starring Kristen Stewart as the American starlet – is released in the UK next month. It tells the story of the star who was plucked out of obscurity in Marshalltown, Iowa after a talent search and became a darling of the French New Wave – starring in Otto Preminger’s Saint Joan in 1957 and then Jean Luc-Godard’s Breathless in 1960. Seberg’s career looked set to continue with big roles on either side of the Atlantic, but her association with black radicals and the Panthers would put her in the crosshairs of the FBI.In October 1968, Seberg was on the same flight as the former heroin addict turned revolutionary Hakim Jamal, who was married to a cousin of Malcolm X. Based in Compton, Los Angeles, Jamal acted as a fixer for the Black Panthers to meet with Hollywood royalty such as Marlon Brando. Jamal and Seberg would develop a close relationship – the Seberg biopic paints it as a sexual one, but her biographer Garry McGee claims it was platonic – with the actor becoming a key supporter of radical causes in Los Angeles.After starring in the air-disaster turkey Airport, Seberg transferred $5,000 to Jamal’s account. She bought a bus for his Compton school, and in April 1969 hosted a fundraiser at her home. Paul Newman and Vanessa Redgrave attended, as did Joanne Woodward, Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda who – before she became infamous after raising her fist in the black power salute while on the Oscars red carpet in 1970 – donated $1,000 to the school. Seberg’s support of leftwing political movements and donations to the Black Panther party were deemed enough to make her “a social nuisance” in the eyes of the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover. In Seberg, the FBI is represented by Vince Vaughn’s clownish agent and his morally compromised partner, played by Jack O’Connell. They are told they must carry on hounding the actor because the orders come “straight from the top” – meaning Hoover, who would sign off on the release of information to a gossip column in Hollywood that indicated that Seberg was pregnant with Jamal’s child. It was a lie – she had in fact got pregnant after a fling with a young Mexican actor – but it spread before she’d had a chance to explain the situation to her French husband, Romain Gary, driving a wedge between them. Seberg had a miscarriage in 1970 – the stress and paranoia that she endured having possibly contributed to it – and a mental breakdown. In a 1974 interview with the New York Times, Seberg discussed leaving the world of the black radicals behind – not because of the FBI intimidation, but because she felt her breakdown had made her a burden. “I’ve analysed the fact that I’m not equipped to participate absolutely and totally,” she said. “I had a very, very bad mental breakdown, and now I realise I wouldn’t want a person like me in a group I was a member of, as Groucho Marx would put it.”She also discussed returning home with her dead baby to prove the child’s ethnicity. “We opened the coffin and took 180 photographs, and everybody in Marshalltown who was curious what colour the baby was got a chance to check it out,” she said. “A lot of them came to look.” Seberg remained in Paris where her mental health problems continued. At 40 she was found dead in her car, after an apparent suicide. The Seberg case showed the lengths the FBI would go to in order to sabotage those associated with the Panthers, but it also highlighted the pull of the group. New Hollywood stars didn’t have to go as far as Seberg they could conveniently and safely tap into the group’s energy at fundraisers in Beverly Hills mansions and New York townhouses. Seberg was inspired to start acting after she saw Marlon Brando in The Men in 1950, and 18 years later the pair would be two of the Black Panthers’ most vocal Hollywood supporters. Brando was a boost for the Panthers because he raised their profile, but he was also a way to financially prop up an organisation that was constantly having to find bail money and needed cash to support a rapidly expanding operation.A donor to the Panthers’ cause, Brando gave the eulogy at the funeral of Bobby Hutton, a teenage Panther who was killed in April 1968 by the Oakland police while trying to surrender. “I’m not going to stand up and make a speech because you’ve been listening to white people for 400 years,” he said, before duly going on to give a speech in which he decried living standards for black Americans. After a fundraiser thrown by Shirley Douglas, then married to Donald Sutherland, senior Panther Bobby Seale reportedly said: “We took Marlon Brando for $10,000, we can take Jean Seberg for $20,000.” They would get a lot more from the New Hollywood cohort.The list of celebrity donors to the group reads like a who’s who of New (and old) Hollywood. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton signed cheques. Fonda solicited for donations to the Panthers at Taylor’s Oscars party in 1970. Mia Farrow, Shirley MacLaine and Barbra Streisand all contributed. But the relationship was not a one-way street: the group found inspiration from the new breed of risk-taking film-makers. As Newton became more unpredictable and isolated as the Panthers’ leader, he turned to The Godfather and would extol “its protagonists’ machiavellian cunning and ruthlessness”. Newton also loved Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song – Melvin Van Peebles’s groundbreaking 1971 film about a hustler who becomes a revolutionary and runs away to Mexico – which had more than a slight resemblance to his own story. Such fandom translated into real-life attempts at film-making. Richard Pryor was a close friend of Newton and was working on a screenplay about the Black Panther leaders’ life at Schneider’s LA home when an accident while freebasing cocaine left him with burns to his face and body he abruptly kiboshed the project. Seale and Newton were also reportedly working on a blaxploitation screenplay when their relationship broke down and Seale fled Oakland after Newton allegedly had him pistol-whipped.New Hollywood documentaries detailed the Panthers’ rise and contributed to their mystique. Howard Alk’s American Revolution 2 follows the Panthers after the unrest at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago as its leadership attempts to form an alliance with poor, disenfranchised whites. Alk’s The Murder of Fred Hampton serves as an “exposé of state-sponsored anti-black terror”, with the documentary maker attempting to reveal the extent of the FBI’s involvement in the young, charismatic leader’s death. David Weiss’s No Vietnamese Ever Called Me Nigger makes the link between the black liberation and anti-war movements, while documenting the anti-Vietnam-war march on the United Nations in 1967.Perhaps the most potent Panthers documentary is Agnès Varda’s 27-minute portrait, which captures the energy of the nascent movement in Oakland during the summer of 1968. Stokely Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver and Kathleen Cleaver articulately unpack the Panthers’ Marxist ideology, while other female Panthers explain the importance of wearing their hair naturally. Fifty years later, it still feels radical and Karina Longworth, host of You Must Remember This – who dedicated an exhaustive and excellent eight-episode run of her podcast to the story of Jane Fonda, Seberg and their relationship to black radical groups – believes Varda’s film represents the kind of romantic view of the group that Seberg and the New Hollywood supporters may have shared.Other films tapped into the comic potential of the Panthers, none more so than Robert Downey Snr’s innovative Putney Swope. Made in 1969, the same year Easy Rider ushered in the new wave of US film-making, it’s the story of a token black executive at a Madison Avenue ad agency – played by Arnold Johnson with his voice dubbed by the director – who accidentally becomes chairman and then replaces all the white employees with black revolutionaries. Advocates of the film include Paul Thomas Anderson, Louis CK and Boots Riley, who took the voice-dubbing concept to an even more surreal level in his 2017 satire Sorry to Bother You. So what became of Newton after his daring sea crossing? He was eventually released by the Cuban authorities and briefly settled down into a life of sugar-cane farming and motor repairs. At the same time, BBS Productions ran out of steam in a Hollywood that had shifted from late-60s optimism and invention into the late-70s blockbuster era. Newton’s caper was effectively BBS’s last act. But Schneider would have another revolutionary moment, when he appeared on stage at the 1975 Academy Awards to accept his award for best documentary for his anti-Vietnam-war doc Hearts and Minds. He offered “greetings of friendship to all the American people” from the North Vietnamese government, while dressed in a white tuxedo. Meanwhile, Jane Fonda continued to promote revolutionary politics, and the 1979 Academy Awards would become known as the “Vietnam Oscars” because of the political tensions over two New Hollywood anti-war movies, Coming Home and The Deer Hunter.  It is easy to mock the radical affiliations of Brando, Schneider and Fonda as contrived bandwagon jumping. But in the 70s they risked their careers and, in the case of Seberg, destroyed them in order to support a cause. In our age of ephemeral hashtag activism, when stars can send a tweet about an issue and be celebrated for it, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate their radical chic. • Seberg is released on 10 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3a724566a8330cab5c7c580ac03914d8db309a/0_142_2506_1504/master/2506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82697b90fe27324ed8f31ab390cad0e5","title":"maggie smith harry potter downton abbey were not satisfying","story":"The actor has said that, while grateful for the work, ‘I didn’t really feel I was acting in those things’Dame Maggie Smith has said her work in the Harry Potter films and on Downton Abbey “wasn’t what you’d call satisfying”.The actor, 84, played schoolmistress Minerva McGonagall in the boy-wizard films and the waspish Violet Crawley in the period drama. Discussing the earlier years of her career, she told ES magazine: “It seemed to take ages to get away from light comedy.”She added: “I am deeply grateful for the work in Potter and indeed Downton, but it wasn’t what you’d call satisfying. I didn’t really feel I was acting in those things.”Smith returned to the stage this year as Joseph Goebbels’ secretary in the Christopher Hampton one-woman play A German Life. She said that as soon as she agreed to do it, she suffered “doubt, doubt, doubt”.“I suddenly felt twice as old as I actually was,” she said. “And also, when you haven’t done a show for a long time, there’s something pretty dumb about doing it totally on your own.”The long-awaited Downton Abbey movie made almost $200m on release earlier this year, with home entertainment numbers expected to be healthy. Smith was reported to be on of the last cast members to agree to the feature film her involvement would also be key to any sequel.Speaking about the possibility of a followup last week, one of the film’s producers, Graham Neame, confirmed there is a potential film in the works.“We’re working on what the story is,” he said, “and when we might be able to make it.“But it’s the same as the first time around: we have to try and get everyone back together again. And that was very challenging.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c3dce56c0437bb89149ddf1cf5809896d8fe173/15_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e3e0dd2e72ecc6d6fbbf291454e8562","title":"stardog and turbocat review sci fi animation","story":"A canine astronaut crashes back to Earth 50 years into the future in this relentless, sentimental adventure for younger kidsHere’s a daft, likable enough animation for small kids, with a smashing voice cast but slim pickings for grownups. Nick Frost does a nice job providing a voice for Buddy, a dog sent into orbit in 1969 to test a rocket. When he crashes back down to Earth, he has somehow time-travelled 50 years into the future, to a small American town where an animal-hating meanie cop is cracking down on strays.In this neighbourhood, the streetwise animals mock poor old Buddy for his dumb loyalty to the human who fired him off into space to certain death. Felix (Luke Evans) is a mog who has reinvented himself as TurboCat, a Batman-ish superhero – he even has an English-accented robot butler (elegantly voiced by Bill Nighy). Gemma Arterton is Cassidy, a revolutionary bunny, the leader of a ragtag group of animals fighting for four-legged rights. Ben Bailey-Smith is terrific as her head of military operations, a goldfish with little-animal complex, barking orders from inside his glass bowl.From time to time this is reasonably entertaining there’s a nice double cross, where a character turns out to be a sneering baddie propelled to world domination by bitterness and rejection. Otherwise, the action is relentless and laboured with the odd pause for a sentimental lesson or moment of personal growth.

He finds himself in the bar where he first met his wife, when the world was at his feet, and where customers and staff are all still puffing away on Gauloises. It’s like a peculiarly French mashup of Westworld and The Truman Show.Unlike Truman, though, Victor is aware that his surroundings have been artificially created, and they help him come to terms with his present. Travelling into the past is a conscious decision on his part, one that has been specifically ordered and paid for, albeit from “Les Voyageurs du Temps”, an outfit that sounds like something from a story by Philip K Dick – Rekal Incorporated, perhaps, from We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (the inspiration for Total Recall and its 2012 remake) – or from one of Charlie Kaufman’s screenplays, such as Lacuna Inc. from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Indeed, the plot of La Belle Epoque is so improbable it could almost be sci-fi, but the film has muscled its way to mainstream attention by refashioning its premise as a romantic comedy of manners.In the forthcoming fantasy-adventure comedy sequel Jumanji: The Next Level, three high-school students go back into the role-playing game to rescue a friend. This time, unlike in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017), they make a conscious decision to immerse themselves in an artificial world, where you can be sure a fresh set of life lessons will be learned. And in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, due in UK cinemas next month, TV personality Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks) dispenses benign aperçus and life lessons from the studio where he presides over a pastel-coloured toy village complete with model railway, “Owl Correspondence School” and puppet population. No one is under the illusion that the village is real, yet it’s not an escapist theme park so much as a safe place of emotional honesty and positive thinking.These characters use their simulated realities in a therapeutic way, just as Mark Hogancamp (Steve Carell) in Welcome to Marwen (2018) deals with the brain damage he sustained in an attack by white supremacists by building a village in his backyard. Not just any village but a Belgian one in the second world war. No longer able to paint or draw because of his injuries, Hogancamp works through his unresolved trauma by setting up and photographing melodramatic scenarios in which the village’s Action Man and Barbie doll inhabitants, as avatars of himself and the people he knows, repeatedly fight back against the Nazi invaders.Such scenarios stand out amid one of the most pervasive cinema trends of the past 30 years, in that they’ve added a layer of awareness to the “rubber reality” syndrome. From The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) onwards, the cinema has always dabbled in alternative realities and imaginary worlds, but towards the end of the 20th century this tendency went into overdrive. In film after film, characters discover that their world is not what it seems. That it is, in fact, a fictional construct sparked by psychological or pathological conditions (Jacob’s Ladder Fight Club A Beautiful Life), or created by aliens (Dark City), an artificial intelligence (The Matrix), psychiatrists (Shutter Island), the supernatural (The Sixth Sense The Others), self-delusion (Mulholland Drive) or friends and relatives (Good Bye, Lenin! 50 First Dates).Rubber reality also crept into crime movies such as The Usual Suspects, Wild Things and at least two thrillers with the tip-off title Deception (2000 and 2008). Such films are fanciful, more personalised updates of the political paranoia thrillers of the 1970s. In preposterous thrillers such as Malice (1993), 88 Minutes (2007), Trance (2013) and Side Effects (2013), the criminal masterplan is so elaborate and requires such insane levels of plotting that you almost feel sorry for the villains, who really ought to have channelled all that preparation and ingenuity into a more lucrative, less risky undertaking, such as politics.Classic film noir, in which the antihero is entangled in a web of deception, often spun by femmes fatales in cahoots with the bad guys, was a shadowy precursor to the reality-is-not-as-it-seems scenario. And just as that genre in its 1940s heyday reflected the anxiety and alienation of a society still traumatised by the second world war and undermined by shifts in moral certitude, so the rise of rubber reality cinema coincided with the evolution of the conspiracy theory from a minority pursuit into a mainstream interest fed by the internet, The X-Files, 911, falsified WMD reports, the Panama Papers and Wikileaks.With so many films pedalling the scenario that the narrative is not to be trusted, audiences have become almost addicted to the “twist”, expecting or demanding one even where it doesn’t exist. Thus they’ve also been primed for a situation in which reality can no longer be trusted, facts are indistinguishable from fiction, everyone has a hidden agenda, the moon landing was faked, vaccination causes autism, the Earth is flat, and Britain can return to a great and glorious past in which the rest of the world falls over itself to shower it with amazing trade deals.With or without a narrative twist, films already offer alternate realities in which audiences can seek refuge, whether it’s an idealised vision of class-ridden Britain in the Downton Abbey movie, the extended Lucasverse of the Star Wars franchise and its TV spin-offs, or the Marvel films, where might is always right and the good guys come out on top. In this context, it’s heartening to see a few pioneers such as La Belle Époque and A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, which suggest to audiences that they themselves can control the narrative, rather than be controlled by it, and that - rather than requiring an army of servants, a full set of Infinity Stones or the Force, all it will take is emotional honesty and clear-eyed thinking.• Jumanji: The Next Level is released in UK cinemas on 13 December. A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood is released on 31 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790e4100b61f9a2ff0aa8a257418d7c4a350aa13/763_257_5143_3087/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a87fc6f6f166a9a3eef58ead633716","title":"crisps cheese and curacao how to have a fantastic election night party","story":"It may be a bit early to bring this up, but on the other hand, it is only a week away: what are you going to eat on election night? On 1 May 1997, a journalist named Gavin Hills held an election party that became the stuff of fable.There was a firework for every Tory, let off when they lost their seat, and the sky was ablaze. I wasn’t there, as I didn’t know him, but people talked about it so fervently afterwards that it has entered my memory as the best election night I ever had – the one I wasn’t at. Hills died in a freak drowning accident the same month, tragically young at 31, and the magic of the election party died with him. Now, instead, we have snacks.In the 00s elections, it tended to be pretty clear who was going to win, because Labour was going to win. I remember doing a Question Time-style panel for some sixth formers in 2010, and some bright spark asked Gus O’Donnell whether the civil service was ready for a hung parliament. “Never mind a coalition, we’re not ready for a change of government,” he said.Even though elections are inherently exciting because you get to stay up late, there was very little to get excited about, few marginals and even fewer surprises.You can have a lot of fun with colour coding when the stakes aren’t very high. I used to make cheesecakes decorated as a bar chart of the vote share, which was a shame as people actually prefer blueberries to strawberries, and kiwi to lemon. You can do the same with tiny quiches (cheese, chorizo, spinach), so long as you pretend to think aubergines are blue, when they are actually purple, and you ignore Ukip for disambiguation, which we all did, anyway, probably for too long.That was quite a lot of work in 2001 2005 was entirely crisps. Cheese and onion for the Tories, salt and vinegar for the Greens, roast chicken for the Lib Dems and spicy tomato Wheat Crunchies for Labour, which are – when in the right mood – the most delicious crisp imaginable.In 2010, the accepted wisdom was that Labour would probably scrape through again. There was just a residual sense that the country would give Gordon Brown one term of his own, because of fairness, and how long he had been waiting. Subconsciously, I must have known that wasn’t true, because my hosting strategy was to get everyone completely hammered. It had taken a decade, but having finally acknowledged that there were no blue foods apart from fruit, and that nobody wants fruit at a party, I went nuts with blue curaçao (plus vodka and lemonade to make a blue lagoon), very red negronis, greyhounds (which are yellowish) and caipirinhas. When the results started to roll in, nobody could understand them – it was like watching dogs try to do crosswords.There is a salient point to make here about how often accepted wisdom is wrong not because polling is flawed or the country has changed in invisible ways, but because of the baseline assumption that things will probably be a bit like they were last time.So, in 2015, everyone was expecting another hung parliament, and the mood turned to ash at exactly 10pm with the exit polls. I can’t remember whether or not people immediately went home, but they definitely didn’t eat the colour-coded macarons, which was good, as they are mad expensive and I hadn’t bought enough.I didn’t have a party for the EU referendum, because it was a stain on democracy. Nor in 2017, because, again, even though I didn’t believe the prevailing certainty of a Tory landslide, I didn’t think I had the stomach to toast it if it happened.This year is different, because I’ve had an epiphany it would have been helpful to have in 2010: whatever the result, the day after will demand more energy and fellowship, not less.So this year, I’m focusing on people rather than parties – which, in any case, are more fun to represent. I’ll take a bunch of marginals and make a finger food out of regionally appropriate snacks. A lot of them will be by the sea (North East Fife, Hastings and Rye, Workington), so fish finger sandwiches. All anyone eats in Richmond and Cheltenham is vol-au-vents. Brecon and Radnorshire is, of course, in Wales, which cracks open the world of the welsh rarebit. Anywhere not by the sea probably has its own cheese.I’m not promising to enjoy it: I might just sit in and eat all this stuff on my own. But I do plan to unite the kingdom in buffet form, and if that means getting in the Staffordshire oatcakes (Newcastle-under-Lyme), that’s fine by me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c1d9f12e22929ebb94cb89170b6707a1d9bf19/0_281_5802_3481/master/5802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7a15de447875db95f300d39f3b7ad1d","title":"how to eat a crisp sandwich","story":"This month, How to eat is munching on a complex dish rarely discussed in polite society. Do you use butter or mayo? Is white bread essential? Do Wotsits work?The crisp sandwich is food’s equivalent of picking your nose. We all do it. Yes, even you. And, particularly in private, it can be a source of profound pleasure. But only rarely do you find a few brave souls – chapeau!, Jack Monroe, Nadiya Hussain and Emma Freud – willing to talk about it in public.This is a processed-food item so persuasive that even a chef as organically handcrafted as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall cannot resist it (“It’s very hard to beat a good crisp sandwich.”), yet – bar that curious outbreak of crisp butty cafes in 2015 – we collectively neglect serious analysis of what makes it such a comfort-food classic. We are ashamed. Inhibited by snobbery. Waiting for a Spanish chef to deconstruct it or a hip Williamsburg diner to reassure us it is cool.But who has time for that? At How to Eat – the series exploring how best to consume Britain’s favourite foods – there is no guilt, only pleasure. Therefore, let us settle once and for all on the crisp sandwich’s ultimate form.Naturally, HTE is fully in favour of real bread – in the right circumstances. This is not one of them. Put the sourdough back. Step away from the worthy loaves. The crisp sandwich is meant to be an uninhibited pig-out, which will be ruined by using earnest wholemeal or ostensibly healthy seeded breads. Not only will their flavour jar horribly with the crisps, but the pious presence of those self-righteous seeds and grains will cast an anxious pall over proceedings, as if the bread is judging your filling and finding it wantonly gluttonous.Instead, you need a mass-produced white sliced loaf that, in its milky blandness, will offer more cushioning texture than flavour. It should be a neutral delivery vehicle for your chosen crisp.Not all supermarket loaves are created equal, however. Many are as light and airy as packing foam, with none of its durability. These fragile breads fall apart at the first flash of a butter knife. Ideally, you want to forcibly squash the top layer of your sandwich down as you make it, to mould it around the crisps, so it neatly retains them as you eat. For that, you need relatively dense squishy bread, such as Jackson’s white bloomer or – if you can stomach the company’s £25,000 donation to the Conservative party in 2010 – perhaps the world’s best crisp-sandwich bread, Warburtons toastie loaf.If using a less politically compromised cob, bap or roll, avoid those with firm crusts that require you to tear at them. You will scatter crisp shrapnel everywhere. In that regard, a baguette is the least-practical crisp sandwich bread. Do not think about toasting your bread. This is already a dry sandwich.Like many of the best things in life, a crisp sandwich needs lubrication. Ultimately, you will slather your slice with what you can afford. Margarine does a job, particularly on a crisp sandwich. It oils the wheels of mastication without positively boosting flavour. But if you do have a pound or three spare, HTE is unbending in its view that butter is one of the best investments in the supermarket chiller cabinet. Yes, its rich creaminess is a marginal gain in this context. But what is the pursuit of perfection if not the painstaking accumulation of such gains?The idea that on a crisp butty of all things, you would deny yourself butter on health grounds and instead subject yourself to one of the light ’n’ spreadable, sterol-and-stanol, I-never-believed-it-wasn’t-butter-vegetable-oil options is baffling. You. Are. Eating. A. Crisp. Sandwich. The boat has sailed on blood pressure. Its salt levels will be unacceptable to all medical professionals. Your arterial health is an accident waiting to happen. We are dying. Every day. Embrace that reality or this endeavour will have been a comparative waste of time. And calories. For a diminished flavour payoff.The crisp sandwich is an all-in, sod-the-consequences commitment. For instance, there are multiple things wrong with this Sainsbury’s recipe (onion, tomato, gherkins, salad leaves!), but perhaps the worst is its use of unsalted butter. On a crisp sandwich. In health terms, this is the dictionary definition of a false economy.HTE refuses to get into an argument about whether extruded corn snacks are crisps or not. It will not indulge Pringles pedants, who refuse to acknowledge a product consisting of rice flour and wheat starch mixed into a dehydrated potato base. Instead, HTE takes the following highly unscientific position: is it in the crisp aisle in the supermarket? Then it is a crisp. Yes, even the nuts and Mini Cheddars.That settled, surely we can all agree that “fluffy” crisps – Monster Munch, Skips, spicy Nik Naks, Quavers, Chipsticks, generic cheesy balls – have no role to play in a crisp sandwich? The flavour intensity of Wotsits makes them tempting, and Frazzles taste more like bacon than bacon. But you need a crisp that offers a definitive crunch and clear textural contrast here. Not corn snacks that, when sandwiched between two slices of bread, produce what feels like a mouthful of cotton wool.Fluffy crisps share that dehydration issue with, at the other extreme, Doritos, Scampi Fries and Mini Cheddars. Yes, they all pack plenty of crunch, but they lack the palpable easy-eating greasiness of mainstream crisps. A Mini Cheddar sandwich turns to claggy putty in the mouth. You would need several pints of water to get it down.For different reasons, HTE is also ruling out posher “hand-cooked” crisps in the Kettle sphere and upwards. Generally, they are too thick and rigid in a sandwich (yes, there is such a thing as too crunchy) and, in the case of Tyrells, their pure flavours create a psychological dissonance. In a crisp sandwich, you do not want crisps that actually taste of the advertised ingredients. If you wanted a cheesy flavour, you would make a cheese sandwich. Rather, you want that lab-refined synthetic cheese-style cheese-and-onion flavour profile that, while it owes little to nature, wows on its own terms.That is the curious paradox at the heart of the crisp sandwich: it works best when you add crisps that mimic sandwich ingredient flavours, so roast chicken, salt and vinegar (chip butty), smoky bacon or cheese and onion, rather than sweet chilli or prawn cocktail. But you also want those flavours delivered at the heightened, entirely artificial, level of intensity that only the cleverest boffins of the food-industrial complex can achieve using ingenious combinations of yeast extract, citric acid, garlic powder, dried cheese “cheese flavour” and umami disodium 5’-ribonucleotide.The crisp-sandwich-filling sweet spot, then, is to be found in a mainline bag of Walkers (other brands are available) or, another marginal but important gain, in slightly thicker ridge-cut crisps such as Seabrook ascending to the – fans self! – positively hunky McCoy’s. Firm and muscular, yet given to melting greasily in the mouth, the all-powerful salt and vinegar McCoy’s is, perhaps, the ultimate crisp sandwich filling.Note: never use ready-salted crisps. Too parsimonious. There isn’t a war on. Yet.If you are going the full home-cooked-potato-sandwich hog, different rules apply. But it is incredibly difficult to sparingly apply Tommy K or hot sauce without drowning the crisp’s flavour. You are now eating a ketchup or hot sauce sandwich with crunchy bits. That is wrong.If the butter has been applied liberally enough (if not, why not?), there should be no need for mayonnaise, much less salad cream. Regular readers will know that HTE is unapologetically proud of its working-class origins. But a certain reverse snobbery attaches itself to salad cream. Salad cream is the point at which clinging to your roots reveals a debilitating lack of ambition and curiosity, and a refusal to conceive of a wider world of possibilities.Is it shame, embarrassment or a desperate need to create new content that inspires advice on how to “pimp” a crisp butty or “take your crisp sandwich game to the next-level”? HTE cannot say.What it does know is that most of the commonly added extras – cold, clammy ham thick, gluey peanut butter overpoweringly vinegary pickles – actively detract from the sandwich. As do attempts to give it a gourmet spin. The crisp sandwich does not need brie, bacon jam or rocket. Or caviar. It does not need to justify itself on foodie terms. Go down that route – as per Burts steak and stilton recipe with sea salt and peppercorn crisps – and the crisps soon become a mere seasoning on an entirely different sandwich. That is, as the late Amy Winehouse used to like sliced on top, bananas.A little extra-mature cheddar brings greater depth to a cheese-and-onion crisp sandwich, but even that it is far from essential.A plate. Or the Hoover. You will need one. Possibly both.Curiously (it’s the bread), while HTE would never eat a bag of crisps with a brew – that requires beer or cola – the crisp sandwich cries out for a steaming mug of something brick red and deeply tannic that you could plot on axes labelled Yorkshire Tea and M\u0026ampS Extra Strong.So, the crisp sandwich: how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af70c234e3b73110a201487c9262cff625563141/0_547_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fbe0eb5afebceda90d7e8c7c0cdd1d1","title":"jay rayner clove cinnamon chocolate boxes christmas stinks","story":"There is no other time of the year that is so completely enveloped in aromas. No wonder our memories are in overdriveIt was the smell of Elnett that did it to me. One moment I was a fiftysomething male. The next, I was a four-year-old boy again. It was just before the start of a live show and I was in the backstage dressing room, staring at myself in the mirror. I concluded my never less than ludicrous hair looked tonight like it had been styled courtesy of me stuffing my wet fingers into a plug socket. Something had to be done. Which was when I spotted the can of Elnett, left behind by a previous performer. I damped down my so-called hairstyle, and went to work setting it in place.The intensity of the smell of the hair lacquer took me by surprise. It was bitter and acrid in a way which catches at the back of the throat, but also heavily perfumed as though trying to hide its true industrial nature. It was the smell of my mother, just before she went out for the night it was the smell of the adult world, of glamour and also of something else. Abandonment would be too strong a word for it, but certainly disappointment would do the job. I was once again the small child standing in my parent’s room watching and smelling the finishing touches being put in place, before she left me to the casual indifference of the babysitter.It’s fitting that it should have happened at this time of year because, frankly, Christmas stinks. There is no other time of the year so completely enveloped by smells. It is wistfulness in three dimensions which, as winter darkness closes in, transports us. We gasp and sigh at the twinkly lights. We find a place in our souls for kitsch. But it’s the seasonal smells which really hammer away. Certainly, they hammer away at me. Awakened by the olfactory punch of Elnett I have become like Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, the foundling antihero of Patrick Suskind’s magnificent novel Perfume, who navigates his way through 18th-century French society courtesy of a talent for identifying aromas.These are the weeks of clove and cinnamon, of ginger and booze-soaked fruit. It’s not all universally pleasant. That the right mix of spices can take me to the cheery thought of a boiling pot of wine, mulled because throwing dried bits of tree bark into substandard wine we wouldn’t dare touch at any other time of year, makes a twisted kind of sense. But if the scent of cinnamon is too artificial, too much like something engineered to mask the smell of a public toilet, suddenly I am wafted to the lobby of a high-end hotel in Dubai. It is the weeks just before Christmas a decade ago, and I am assailed by the memory of feeling so very out of place and so terribly far from home.There is science to explain all this. Apparently, the same part of our brain which recognises smells also stores our emotional responses. It’s designed this way to tell us whether what we are smelling is something we need be scared of or not.It’s useful to know how it works, but that doesn’t describe the personal impact of smelling, say, the virtuous interplay of smoked, cured pig and its clove-studded treacle glaze, in the moments before the ham leaves the oven. It doesn’t describe the hit of dried sage used in a stuffing, or the sickly-sweetness inside a tin of Quality Street when you prise the lid off. Indeed, I’ve come to the conclusion that Christmas really isn’t about family, or presents, or food. It’s all about the smells. Now do excuse me. I’ve got to go and snort some more hairspray."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c82466ad93a779c05e0b9cafe6c17cda14b58d0/40_62_2482_1489/master/2482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcd5293972f91a0821557b42e0ec894c","title":"marco silva on brink after derby thrashing as everton line up david moyes return","story":"Marco Silva is on the brink of the sack as Everton manager following a comprehensive derby defeat by Liverpool, with David Moyes lined up for a return to Goodison Park.Everton conceded five goals against their local rivals for the first time since 1982 as they slipped into the relegation zone with an eighth defeat in 11 league games. Divock Origi and Sadio Mané punished a shambolic defensive display by the visitors as Liverpool set a new club record of 32 league games unbeaten and recorded their 100th Premier League victory under Jürgen Klopp. It could prove to be Silva’s final game as Everton manager, with Moyes favourite to replace the beleaguered Portuguese coach and Tim Cahill being considered as his assistant.Silva admitted Everton were “not good enough” and conceded a series of dreadful goals from a defensive perspective. “We have to do better, be more brave and win more challenges,” he added. “We knew they would make runs in behind but we were not strong enough. It was not good enough, what we did tonight.”Klopp, by contrast, could savour another derby victory after making five changes to the team that started against Brighton on Saturday. The Liverpool manager said: “It was really good, especially in the circumstances I created pretty much myself with the line-up. We had to make changes. It was clear we needed fresh legs and what the boys did in this difficult game was exceptional.”Klopp’s century of league wins as Liverpool manager arrived in 159 games, quicker than any of his predecessors. “It is not a number I’m interested in,” he claimed. “It’s 300 points, that’s cool, but only 43 points helps us this season. The boys are the reason for the wins. It’s just a number, it’s cool but it’s necessary too. We have to keep winning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0383cd2a514005f54ecc03f76b24f3e82090f626/117_71_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8467bd49a4be9408c6faa0ea000d1174","title":"corriere dello sport condemned for black friday front page with lukaku and smalling","story":"The Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport has defended its widely condemned front-page headline “Black Friday” which featured Romelu Lukaku and Chris Smalling as the former Manchester United players prepare to face each other in Serie A on Friday.The front page was heavily criticised but the paper’s director, Ivan Zazzaroni, produced a remarkable defence, saying it was “innocent” and that the article by the journalist Roberto Perrone had “been made poisonous by those who have poison inside them”.The paper was universally condemned, with Smalling’s club, Roma, using social media to show their disgust at the front page, tweeting: “No one. Absolutely no one. Not a single soul”, before the words “Corriere dello Sport headline writer” and a picture of the front page.Inter did not reference the newspaper article but tweeted: “Football is passion, culture and brotherhood. We are and will always be against all forms of discrimination.”The Fare network, which works against discrimination and for social inclusion in football, also tweeted, saying: “The media fuels racism every day. This is today’s edition of Italian sport daily Corriere dello Sport.”Fare’s executive director, Piara Powar, said: “Part of the problem we have with Italy and countries like that at the moment is people do not know where to draw a line. They don’t know what is the right or wrong thing to do, what is appropriate or inappropriate and what might be racism and what might be acceptable.“Would they ever take two white Italian players and say it’s ‘White Tuesday’? They wouldn’t and this is the issue. Why would you pick out two players who are black and highlight their race as a way to build up to the match? It crosses the line of acceptability.”In the article the newspaper appeared to attempt to highlight the league’s racism problem. “In the faces of those idiots who boo, tomorrow everyone must instead go ‘oooh’ like children. It will be a Black Friday, but this is not an end-of-season sale,” the article said. It went on to describe Lukaku and Smalling as “two giants of colour”.Zazzaroni’s defence of the front page and the article added to the anger and dismay in Italy and abroad. “Social media? … Full of noble grudges and cut-price indignation,” it read. “A kind thought a day keeps the doctor away. These days armies of right-minded people flock to the web to whitewash their beautiful souls. You locate the racist of the hour and off you go, in two strokes of the keyboard the stain has gone, you feel a better person in a better world. White, black, yellow.”It continued: “Denying the difference is the age-old stumbling block of the racist anti-racist. The mental slum inhabited by part-time moralists, who suddenly are always on duty. ‘Black Friday’, for those who want to and are able to understand it, was only ever praising ersity, taking pride in ersity, the magnificent wealth of ersity. If you don’t understand it, it’s because you can’t do that. It is an innocent article, perfectly argued by Roberto Perrone, that has been turned to poison by people who are full of poison.”Lukaku and Smalling have made successful starts to their careers in Italy. Lukaku has 10 goals in 14 Serie A games with Inter top of the league, one point ahead of Juventus. Smalling has been an ever-present since his debut against Atalanta towards the end of September and has scored two goals and provided one assist.Serie A has again been plagued by racist incidents this season, with Lukaku himself and the Brescia forward Mario Balotelli among those racially abused by supporters during games. An Italian TV pundit was sacked for saying the only way to stop Lukaku was to give him “10 bananas to eat”.Last week all 20 clubs in Italy’s top tier signed an open letter which called on “all those who love Italian football” to unite to try to eradicate its “serious problem with racism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1bac89e81d70f146141430d781bad4c47068e60/0_317_4726_2836/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36a76ab475b052e5569b6e29a7f53b4f","title":"macclesfield preparing boycott of league two match with crewe","story":"Macclesfield’s players and staff say their League Two match against Crewe will not go ahead, although there has been no official confirmation the game is off.Last month, the Cheshire club were charged with misconduct by the EFL over their failure to pay players. The first team had followed through on a strike threat during November, forcing Macclesfield to field youth-team players in an FA Cup tie against Kingstonian, which they lost 4-0.On Thursday, a joint statement issued on behalf of Macclesfield players and staff said the Crewe game would not be going ahead as scheduled. “As a group, we’d like to inform the EFL and Crewe Alexandra Football Club that the game on Saturday won’t be taking place despite growing reports that is is ‘business as usual’,” the statement read. “This is down to the fact that salaries have not been paid for last month.“We have not trained as a squad since last Thursday due to the fact we have no training ground but, most importantly, the game can’t go ahead for the emotional and mental well-being of the players which is currently rock bottom. We hope that our own fans, who have been tremendous, Crewe fans and the whole of the football community can understand this decision with it being such an important month for us all on and off the pitch.”Following the joint statement, Crewe said they were seeking more clarity. “The club are aware of media reports surrounding Saturday’s fixture against Macclesfield Town,” read a statement on Crewe’s Twitter feed. “We will continue to keep our supporters updated as and when we have been informed with more information on the matter.”It is understood there has yet been no official decision taken either way as to whether Saturday’s match will go ahead. The Professional Footballers’ Association is in constant discussions with Macclesfield’s players and the EFL over the matter, while the EFL board is set to discuss the matter at a meeting on Thursday afternoon.

However, the night before their departure, while taking a walk in the Croatian capital they were stopped by two police officers who asked them for identification documents.“We tried to explain who we were and that our documents were in the hostel, but they took us to a police station,” Chinedu told the Bosnian website Žurnal. “They paid no attention to what we were saying.”The officers mistook them for undocumented immigrants, put them in a van and transferred them to the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina where, that day, Croatian authorities had gathered together a group of migrants intercepted as they were attempting to cross the country. Police ordered the group to cross through the woods and into Bosnia-Herzegovina.“I refused to go into the woods,” said Chinedu. “The officer told me he would shoot me if I didn’t move.”Uchenna and Chinedu were eventually deported to Bosnia-Herzegovina and ended up in a camp in Velika Kladuša, where thousands of migrants are stuck in tents without water or heating with temperatures as low as -2C.The two Nigerian students could not make themselves understood and it took until the end of November before volunteers at the camp contacted representatives of the sports competition to tell them Uchenna and Chinedu were trapped there.“They told me two students from Nigeria were taken to Bosnia by Croatian police,” the organiser Alberto Tanghetti told the . “I asked them to send me photos and their names. After careful verification, we confirmed that those boys had participated in the tournament and had regular visas, issued by the Croatian authorities. I really don’t understand what happened, because even the police in Pula were notified that they were here.”He added: “It is even more absurd that no one believed the boys when they tried to explain to the police officers that they had regular visas. It would have sufficed to accompany them to the hostel to verify that they had entered Croatia legally.”Croatian police and the interior ministry in Zagreb have been contacted for comment.“Those people are victims of illegal acts of the Croatian side,” Dragan Mektić, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s minister of security, told Al Jazeera. “Respecting legal procedures, we now have to take them back to Croatia … It is obvious that they have Croatian visas, that they are in Bosnia and Herzegovina illegally. From their statements, it is obvious that Croatian police forcibly displaced them and we have to bring them back there.”For years, aid workers and agencies have accused the Croatian authorities of illegally sending migrants trying to cross the border back to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Migrants are systematically beaten by Croatian police, who strip asylum seekers of their personal items and destroy their mobile phones to avoid being filmed.Last year, the  documented compelling evidence of the physical abuse perpetrated by Croatian police, of which migrants in the Bosnian cities of Bihać and Velika Kladuša have been complaining.

As noted in a recent  piece, a new wave of writers has emerged, rightly determined to overturn the longstanding critical bias against the genre. Under their influence, pop has been freighted with great sociopolitical import, its stars recast not as marionettes at the mercy of the music industry but as auteur figures. Under the circumstances, you can see why Camila Cabello has talked up the follow-up to her platinum-selling solo debut as something more than a mere collection of songs. “I was very intentional about the world I was creating,” she told one fashion magazine. “I made mood boards, I brought posters into the studio to set the vibe. It was the first time I’d done something like that.” What did the mood boards show, wondered the interviewer. “Lots of people kissing,” offered Cabello.If you think there’s a certain bathos in that statement, or that it’s not strictly necessary for a pop star to intentionally create a world, make mood boards, etc, to record an album of love songs, then you haven’t been paying close attention to the gossip rags. Romance’s arrival was trailed by Señorita, a bit of beach bar-friendly summer fluff that went to No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic. It offered the Latin pop of Cabello’s fantastic 2017 single Havana – a breakthrough smash that smartly underlined her Cuban roots – viewed through a Vaseline-smeared lens. The hook was an inescapable ear worm, but you did wonder how on earth it needed eight songwriters – including Charli XCX and one member of Clean Bandit – to come up with something so insubstantial. No matter: its success was bolstered by widespread speculation about whether Cabello and Shawn Mendes, her duet partner and video co-star, were actually at it in real life. In the ensuing months, every cameraphone-captured public snog, every soppy Instagram message and every hot denial that the relationship was a publicity stunt has been breathlessly reported. Under the circumstances, Cabello announcing that her new album is about love counts as a canny move. If the public are going to pruriently speculate about your private life, then why not play on it?Anyone in search of salacious titbits regarding the CabelloMendez hook-up is going to go home hungry. We learn that Mendes is a vast improvement on Cabello’s last partner, of whom more later, but the lyrics stick largely to generalisations of the “Got me beggin’ you for more” variety, peppered with proclamations of undying love, some of which are confusingly expressed. “When you touch me,” she cries on Living Proof, “paint me like a Van Gogh.” Dressed as a 19th-century Belgian peasant? Smoking a pipe? Eating a potato?The music, meanwhile, dials down the Latin inflections of her debut, although there’s some flamenco-styled guitar and handclapping here and there, and fizzy Carlos Santana-ish soloing on Should’ve Said It, a track with a melody indebted to En Vogue’s Don’t Let Go. Everywhere else, Romance wheels out the current pop bag of tricks, from Sia-esque soaring choruses to field recordings of West African singing.Sometimes this approach works really well. Shameless is an exercise in mounting tension that slowly builds from an opening inspired by the xx and never quite explodes into the balls-out arena rock you expect. My Oh My enlists North Carolina rapper DaBaby for three minutes of campy 1950s horror-movie soundtrack fun, replete with sampled screams. And the album can be dazzling in its ruthless sense of purpose: the closing First Man is an effective tearjerker in which a new bride addresses her father, which may well end up where it clearly wants to be, as a staple of wedding dances.Sometimes, however, the songwriting is just so-so. Bad Kind of Butterflies slips in one ear and out of the other, leaving no trace Liar is a attempt to meld mariachi horns with the tinny Euro-reggae of Ace of Base, a cocktail that is no more appetising in practice than it looks on paper. You may find yourself questioning some of the production choices, not least the decision to use Auto-Tune not as a special effect but as a kind of cure-all lotion slathered over every syllable that passes Cabello’s lips. After a while, it becomes distracting and counter-productive: a cyborg sheen on what are ostensibly heartfelt songs of burgeoning new love.On Easy, Cabello contrasts said new love with her previous relationship: “I always thought I was hard to love until you made it seem so easy.” There’s a certain knife-twisting wit there, given that her previous relationship was with a self-styled relationship guru, the implication being that “the world’s leading dating advice expert for women”, as his YouTube channel bills him, may want to reconsider how much of a world-leading expert he is. Of course, you need to know the backstory to get the full effect. But then, it’s difficult to imagine anyone who buys Romance not knowing the backstory: that’s rather the point, the means by which a flawed album seems destined for smash-hit status.Paul Weller – In Another RoomIt’s worth considering for a moment how unlikely the idea of Paul Weller releasing an EP of musique concrète experimentation on a leftfield electronic label would once have seemed. The results are appealingly eerie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57928ec08588b4b2afb3503bdb667578c467a22e/0_1314_2823_1694/master/2823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca06bd1e8f715847396b7075a09a144b","title":"superfan abba shrine recreated for exhibition","story":"Andrew Boardman shares his 44-year devotion to supergroup as part of huge immersive showAndrew Boardman is overcome with emotion as he stares at the cornucopia of Abba singles, albums, cassettes, videos, DVDs, posters, magazines, books, dolls, mugs, calendars, pendants, mugs, T-shirts, badges, posters, baubles, colouring books, games and dolls assembled behind glass windows at the O2 in London.“It does look phenomenal like that I must admit,” he said. “It is amazing to see it out like it is … it’s 44 years.”Boardman, an Abba superfan, is looking at a collection that normally lives, shrine-like, in the front room of his mother’s house in Manchester. “I’ve missed it. I spend hours with it at mum’s when I go round.”The room has been recreated as part of a huge, immersive show that tells the story of the Swedish supergroup and its four members: Agnetha Fältskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson.The exhibition, which opens to the public on Friday, takes up 14,000 sq ft (1,300 sq metres) of space previously used for popular culture shows on Elvis, Prince and Star Wars.It includes artefacts, photographs, videos, interviews, costumes and private letters, many of them going on display for the first time, as well as replicas of things organisers could not quite get their hands on – the scoreboard for Abba’s Eurovision win at the Brighton Dome in 1974, for example, and the helicopter on the front of the album Arrival.Boardman has been a fan since hearing the intro to I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do on the radio as a 12-year-old in 1975. “There was something … it’s stuck with me for the rest of my life, it just really clicked. There was a sound and from then on I was hooked.”He soon got morning and evening paper rounds for money to spend on anything Abba-related he could get his hands on. And he has never stopped: “It has been my life’s passion, you could pick any item and I could tell you where I got it, when I got it.”When video recorders came in, his mum would shout “they’re on”, and he would run down to tape any Abba TV appearance.Boardman thinks he has about 2,500 items and has spent about £50,000 over the years. He listens to Abba all the time. “It upsets everyone but so what. I travel all over the north and I have them on constantly,” he said.The exhibition is a much bigger version of a show at the Southbank Centre staged by its then artistic director, Jude Kelly, to mark the end of a year of Nordic arts and culture. “The Abba team loved how seriously we took their story,” Kelly said. “They asked how would I approach it if it had a much bigger footprint.”The O2 show opens with a room of newspaper headlines and film clips giving people a sense of 1974 Britain. It will either be a jolt of nostalgia, or an education.The snapshot clips include footage from the Daily Mirror gala super girl beauty contest in Stoke-on-Trent Eddie Waring presenting It’s a Knockout in the pouring rain alien metal monsters chuckling at primitive humans for eating potatoes rather than dried nuggets and Edward Heath warning people “in terms of comfort, we shall have a harder Christmas than we have known since the war”.The exhibition, which includes an audio guide narrated by the broadcaster Gemma Cairney, tells the Abba story though the band’s eight studio albums. The Ring Ring room has 30 interactive 1970s telephones for example, while Voulez-Vous has a nightclub disco vibe.Abba split in 1983 but with a museum in Stockholm, a theatre production, two movies and a recently opened dinner and theatre party experience, also at the O2, the band’s profile seems to have grown rather than diminish.In a statement Lyngstad said she could not wait for fans to enjoy the exhibition’s surprises. “From our Eurovision song contest win in Brighton in 74 to the present day, the UK has long held a special place in Abba’s heart, and we have always strongly felt the love and support of our British fans.”• Abba: Super Troupers the Exhibition is at the O2 in London, from 6 December to 31 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78edb425a667d2b3cc9ea06a249ca8fa6fbebcf6/0_0_5152_3316/master/5152.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c952e58149072678616e65def4620834 1760w","title":"sajid javid refuses rule out possibility no deal brexit 2020","story":"Chancellor says scenario is ‘extremely remote’ and claims outline of free trade deal agreedSajid Javid has refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit as he reiterated the Conservatives’ plans to bring the UK out of the EU in March 2020.The chancellor was repeatedly asked on Thursday whether there was a possibility the UK could leave with no deal at the end of 2020. He said the chances of that were “extremely remote” but dodged several opportunities to rule it out.He claimed the outline of a free trade agreement had already been worked out, saying: “By the end of 2020, we will have agreed and finalised the trade deal, a very ambitious, deep, comprehensive free trade agreement. And we will get that done also by the end of 2020.“In the time that we’ve been negotiating over the last 100 days or so, it wasn’t just the exit agreement ... we have also negotiated and worked and agreed the outline of the ambitious free trade agreement.“There is not a single doubt in my mind that it can be agreed within months, and we can get it through parliament by 2020.”Asked what tariffs the car industry would pay under such a deal, Javid said: “Because it’s a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, it’s zero tariffs, zero quotas, not just for the car industry, an agreement on services, having equivalents on financial services, we’ve set all this out.”If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would by default, become a “third country”, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Tory ambitions to pass a tax-cutting, post-Brexit budget within 100 days of taking office have been dismissed by opposition parties, who cast doubt on the feasibility of the timetable. The Liberal Democrats described the plan as “pure fantasy” and accused Boris Johnson of lying to the public.It was put to Javid that Johnson had only managed to secure a new Brexit deal by agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea – which had previously been a major red line – but he did not respond to that point.Painting a stark choice between a Tory majority government and a “chaotic” coalition following a hung parliament, the chancellor also restated his party’s key pledges to increase spending on the NHS and schools, recruit more police officers and raise the threshold at which people begin making national insurance contributions.Asked whether he would have written an article comparing veiled Muslim women to letterboxes, as Johnson had, Javid refused to criticise his party’s leader.“I don’t write articles,” he said. “He was a journalist and he’s written lots of articles, as he’s said himself, people can pick one word out or another but what matters is the kind of prime minister he’s going to be.”His comments came a day after it emerged that Johnson had claimed that children of working mothers in low-income families were more likely to “mug you on the street corner”.Javid, a former Deutsche Bank director, was also asked whether the Conservatives were ashamed of rising homelessness under the party. He sought to deflect blame towards Labour, which had claimed government policies had been “directly responsible” for people living and dying on the streets.“I care deeply about the worst off in our society,” Javid told Sky. “Homelessness reached its peak in 2008 under the last Labour government, since then it’s down by almost a half. There’s still a long way to go, we’ve still got work to do, but it’s Labour that was responsible for the massive rise in homelessness.”The fact-checking charity Full Fact said in a statement: “This morning on Sky News, Sajid Javid claimed that homelessness had fallen by half following a 2008 peak under Labour.“This does not seem correct. Homelessness in England was about the same in 2017 as in 2008, and has risen since 2010, by the main measure.”The housing charity Shelter also said it was wrong to claim that homelessness had gone down.Javid also restated Tory plans to introduce an Australian-style points-based system for immigration. “We have a right to control our borders and that’s what you’ll get with the Conservatives, is this Australian-type system,” he said.“It will mean we will have immigration, of course we will, and immigration – I say this as a second-generation migrant myself – has benefited our country immensely in so many ways.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4704845d04c69edec082ed093af1da7c6d156b8c/57_0_647_388/master/647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f132914b09aa1c17f4d71940404204a","title":"election polls uk 2019 latest opinion poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead using our opinion poll tracker.

Breitbart, the Washington Times, Fox News and the rest of the usual suspects quickly reported the contents of this provocative tweet: “Spent the morning at the Indigenous People’s Sunrise Ceremony on the 50 year anniversary of the Occupation of Alcatraz. The US government has stolen over 1.5 billion acres of land from Indigenous people. Thank you to my Indigenous family, I’m with you today and always.”Just in case that benign announcement didn’t raise the Defcon 1: Apocalypse Looming alarm in your head, Fox started the “news” story by editorializing the contents: “Former NFL player Colin Kaepernick had an odd way of celebrating Thanksgiving, attending an event that appeared to serve as a rebuke to the holiday and the United States.” News reports aren’t supposed to tell us it’s an “odd way” unless they already want to bias the reader. Say it ain’t so, Fox! The conservative political site the Blaze’s headline also wanted to make sure the readers don’t have to burden themselves with thinking: “Colin Kaepernick bashes America on Thanksgiving, participates in ‘Unthanksgiving Day’ celebration.” Technically, pointing out a fact isn’t “bashing.” America’s forefathers did indeed steal the land from the indigenous people, often over their dead bodies. Just as indigenous people stole land from other tribes. That’s just historical fact. Like pointing out to grandpa that his zipper is open. I’m not bashing him, just stating a truth. So, why the panicky attacks on Kaepernick? Clearly, there’s something much more insidious going on here: the sustained attempt to steal Kaepernick’s political voice by characterizing him as un-American. The Black Grinch who wants to steal White Christmas American values.This attempt to drown out Kaepernick’s voice by shouting unfounded personal insults has been going on since he first took a knee during the national anthem in 2016. But really it’s how conservative America has always treated African American athletes who speak out, whether it’s Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Tommie Smith, John Carlos, or any of the others. It’s the equivalent of sticking fingers in their ears while shouting, “Nyah, nyah, nyah, I can’t hear you.”Kaepernick’s highly publicized tryout last month did not seem designed to seriously consider him for readmittance into the NFL. Instead, it looked like a media-savvy sham-show to make the NFL look like the good guys while destroying Kaepernick’s credibility as an athlete and therefore as a spokesman for anything, be it social justice or Nike. When the NFL refused to allow the media to attend and insisted on sole control over the video of the tryout, Kaepernick balked and moved the location so that the media could attend and no one could control how the world witnessed his football skills. The NFL also wanted him to sign a contract apparently agreeing not to sue the league if he wasn’t signed. There was no point to this unusual set-up except to promote a progressive image for the NFL: “See, we’re no longer trying to silence an outspoken athlete. We’ve evolved. We’re woke, baby!” Not really.Neither the focus on his tweet nor the NFL pretense of his tryout are really about Colin Kaepernick, the man or the player. They are about all the other athletes who conservatives are trying to preemptively silence. NBA superstars like LeBron James and Steph Curry are impervious to this kind of treatment, in part because the NBA didn’t campaign to blackball them. Fox News, Breitbart, and the other mouthpieces of entitlement and walling-off-the-truth can’t touch them. But other players, especially young ones working their way up through the ranks, may be stifled by the example of Kaepernick left to twist in the wind of no-change.Fifty years ago, 14 black football players from the University of Wyoming were kicked off the team because they asked their coach if they could wear a black armband in solidarity with the campus group, the Black Student Alliance. The armbands were to protest Brigham Young University, which Wyoming was scheduled to play, because of the Mormon Church’s refusal to allow black parishioners to become clergy, which every white member was entitled to. (This rule was abolished in 1978.) The team recalled that the previous year, when playing at BYU, their opponents spat at them, used racial slurs, and took cheap shots at their knees on the field. The Wyoming coach had ignored his players’ complaints. So, when they walked into the coach’s office to explain what they wanted to do, the coach interrupted them with, “As of this moment, you are no longer members of the Wyoming football team.” The players said he followed it with a racist rant that included telling them to return to their fatherless inner-city homes and live off welfare. The only thing the coach admitted to saying to these athletes was “Shut up!”For much longer than 50 years people have been ordering truth-tellers to shut up and punishing them when they refuse. I’m sure their tactics have silenced some athletes. Not all. They can never silence all because the kind of grit it takes to become an athlete is the same kind it takes to place truth above self-interest. But they sure will keep on trying as long as they get paid to pander to those who wrap themselves in the pretty colors of the flag rather than the bold words of the Constitution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26dfbd0ac3f041383b5a0be2561a1575a3d9bc22/273_181_2958_1775/master/2958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86cd49e64656fac1f678871a65825e11","title":"graham thorpe england new zealand south africa squad","story":"• Batting coach sets sights on South Africa series• Anderson, Wood and Bairstow expected to be named in squadThe final word on England’s series defeat in New Zealand came from Graham Thorpe. The assistant coach was standing in for the absent Chris Silverwood at the end and urged iniduals to reflect honestly on their recent shortcomings.There is a quick turnaround before the tour of South Africa, with Ed Smith’s selection panel convening via conference call on Saturday to pick a touring party that departs on 15 December and plays a four-match series, this time counting for World Test Championship points, that begins on Boxing Day in Centurion.Jimmy Anderson, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow are part of an advanced group already training in Potchefstroom and are expected to be included in a squad of 16 or 17 players, while the captain, Joe Root, is due to speak to Moeen Ali after landing back in the UK to establish the all-rounder’s readiness to return.And for those players who went down 1-0 in New Zealand, Thorpe is keen for the lessons to be learned even if, like Root and a good number in the management setup, this continues to be spoken about in terms of an Ashes series still two years away.“We’ve got to keep developing our players, no doubt about that. They have to ask themselves when they come away from a trip like this: where can I get better?” said Thorpe, who deputised for Silverwood for the last three days in Hamilton with the new head coach back home following a family bereavement.“Because the big picture is that down the line in a couple of years’ time we’ll need resilient cricketers going to Australia. It’s down to our players to be honest and for us to be honest with them. If we are going to keep trying to go up that Test ladder and really compete abroad then we have to keep challenging the players along the way.”Thorpe expects Root’s bowling attack to get more zip out of the South African pitches than the ones in New Zealand that left them so neutered but even so, they must still find a way to conjure up wickets with the Kookaburra ball.As well as talking about hatching more plans for new batsmen and those well set, it was here that Thorpe questioned whether the side’s management of the ball’s condition may need improving – legally, of course, given South African camera crews are pretty eagle-eyed – in order to get more sustained movement through the air.Thorpe bemoaned a failure to seize moments in the field too. In Mount Maunganui the hosts sat on 197 for five, only to post 615 for nine through BJ Watling’s double-century, while Hamilton witnessed 191 for five become 375 all out as New Zealand’s hugely determined wicketkeeper held firm once more.He added: “The mark of a top side is one that recognises when it’s on top and is able to push it through. That’s our big learning experience from this series, for me.”As the coach responsible for the batsmen, Thorpe naturally offered support for Dom Sibley after a tricky first outing of 38 runs in three innings, insisting it was “still early days”, and was encouraged by Ollie Pope’s 75 in Hamilton that showed the “technique and temperament” England are looking for from their Test batsmen.While Rory Burns took another step up in his own development with a second Test century, Root’s double, the third of his career, was clearly the standout performance with the bat. Thorpe cited its impact on the captain’s own authority and the knock-on effect for a side striving to regularly put big first innings totals on the board.He added: “It’s great to see Root back and scoring some runs and how he is in the dressing room as well – that’s great for his confidence. But he was already held in very high esteem, so he’s just confirmed that and also that he’s a world-class player.“We’ve talked a certain way about batting a long time and I think we mustn’t misinterpret that. For me it’s just getting a big first-innings score – a 500-run target. That’s a good way of selling it to the players. And if Joe can produce more performances like that, we’ve got more chances of getting that sort of total.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2582e921b9a9714c77137515de2230f61d18e4dd/214_296_1507_904/master/1507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=696a6f5249b29131fbe9c1cb70ff2ba4","title":"20 great travel gift ideas experiences for christmas","story":"Rather than buying more stuff this Christmas, why not give an active, creative or relaxing experience?

But are podcasts really a parent’s best friend? There are now so many of them that parenting podcasts have become a genre of their own, like true crime or middle-aged comedians getting angry about the word ‘woke’. It’s easy to see why. Having kids can simultaneously be overwhelming and lonely, and nothing helps like knowing that other people feel the same way, especially via a medium as intimate as podcasting. The touchstones – especially during the early years – are so universal that it can be genuinely helpful to hear other people struggle with the same thing without fear of judgment. I’ve only really latched on to a couple of them, but they’re arguably the best two. The Longest Shortest Time is basically the This American Life of parenting podcasts, with each episode covering a different parent-specific subject with precision and authority. There have been episodes about single trans parents, about the architecture of a teenage brain, about polyamorous parenting. There was just a three-part sperm special, which sperm fans should definitely check out.The other podcast is Scummy Mummies, where comics Helen Thorn and Ellie Gibson interview celebrities about parenting. This one is looser and warmer than The Longest Shortest Time. It’s also capable of disarming devastation at times. One early episode – Ellie’s New Baby – was devoted to recounting one of the host’s recent traumatic birth, and it’s still one of the most affecting podcast episodes I’ve ever heard. The pair maintain their humour, but the trauma of the birth and its aftermath is still palpable. By the end of it everyone is in tears. It is a gorgeous example of podcasting.Besides, parenting podcasts can be a terrible place to go to get advice. When you don’t even have time to get dressed properly every day, there is something supremely offputting about the thought of devoting an hour of your life to directionless waffle just so you can find out which brand of formula milk is the best. In the end, all parents want is a friend in their ear. A peer who can relax them, or inform them, or just help them feel their way through the dark. Someone who understands. And that isn’t going to be the same person for everyone. Some podcasts – especially a few by big-name Instagram influencers – struck me as vapid and insincere. Others are too dry, or too specific. I found my home in The Longest Shortest Time and Scummy Mummies – two hugely different shows. For you, it might be someone totally different. But it will be someone. Especially when the alternative is to go outside and actually talk to another parent. That, I think we can all agree, is about as appealing as being covered in baby barf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea82d60445b7df14bea1b0a9726342cdbf8632b0/0_1043_1154_691/master/1154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d66c225bb393aedce6786f8b68f1af9a","title":"all you want for christmas the high street can deliver","story":"As fairy lights and carols provide the backdrop to your hunt for the perfect gift,  Sophie Benson tells us why it’s the most wonderful time of the year to embrace your local high streetWhen the clocks go back and the afternoons begin to melt into night earlier and earlier, a comforting memory always comes back to me: it’s a late-night shopping Thursday and I’m sitting in a cafe, its walls lined with yellowing newspaper, munching on a croissant with my dad as we both warm up after spending a couple of hours wandering the fairy-lit high street in search of Christmas gifts.What did I buy on that outing? I honestly can’t remember, but it’s the experience that stays with me bundling up in mittens, hat and scarf, walking down damp cobbled streets, the Christmas lights reflected in the puddles between them, and meandering in and out of shops without any real gift in mind, just the hope that the right thing was sitting on a shelf waiting to be found.Now, approximately 20 years later, I still love to head off by myself for a few hours, particularly early in the morning or late in the evening, to soak up the festive atmosphere among the other Christmas shoppers. I set off with a list (a heading for each recipient, with a list of likes, hobbies and possible gifts beneath) and make a point of enjoying myself and savouring the experience. Rather than getting caught up in a panicked, gift-finding frenzy, I like to go at my own pace, venture off the beaten track and take my time picking through what’s on offer at each of my favourite local, independent shops on the high street.I don’t make a beeline for a specific gift instead I linger at each shelf, thumbing through books and smelling every candle. I might not end up buying the organic cotton dressing gown I hold up in front of the mirror or the pair of handmade earrings I gawp at through the cabinet glass, but I still love to browse and see what unexpectedly perfect gift might jump out at me.This spirit of discovery extends to finding new shops too. I’m notorious for “discovering” a new place only to be told that it’s been there for years. Stumbling upon a shop that’s new to me down a side street or following a sign to a tiny, almost-hidden entrance is a treat no matter how long the shop has been there. I adore finding another place to add to my roster, run by someone who cares about the local area and wants to make it a home for their business.I’m not alone in my love of gift hunting on the high street. A survey earlier this year from Visa found that the local high street remains our preferred shopping destination, despite the many different options now available. The draw of the beautifully decorated windows, the Christmas songs on repeat (yes, I love each and every one of them) and the personal experience remain hard to resist.Not only do I love the experience of the day itself, but the people make it special too. Despite the festive rush, I’ve never found myself short on help or advice. There have been plenty of times that a helpful shopkeeper, who’s noticed me circling and sighing, has come to my rescue. When I struggled to pick out a gift for a friend and colleague (who just so happened to have recently given me a wonderfully thoughtful gift that I was finding hard to match), the sales assistant in one of my favourite sustainable boutiques took the time to chat to me. She asked what my friend’s style is, what her hobbies are and what she tends to buy for other people. I left with an ostensibly mismatched but flawlessly suited bundle that included posh vegan sweets and a pin badge. She loved it.Because so many local high street shops handpick their stock, they know it back to front. They’ll tell you all about the maker, their backstory and their values. They’ll reveal all the subtly special things about a gift that in turn will make it even more special to the person who receives it. How lovely to know that a maker only uses recycled materials, for example, and then giving it to someone who does the same in their own life. Or consider how charming it is to give someone a gift made in the town where they grew up. Without attentive, considerate shopkeepers, these extra details would go overlooked and a sweet point of connection could be missed.When the provenance and details of a gift mean so much to the person selling them, so too does the sale. I adore seeing my purchase handwritten in a sales ledger and knowing that it’s significant to the person behind the till. Supporting community businesses, finding unique, personal gifts and getting festive shopping locally brings it all together for me.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware. Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful.

Shops along the route of a march in Paris were advised to close in case of violence on the edges of the demonstration.About half of the scheduled Eurostar trains between Paris and London have been cancelled. Tourists were turned away at the Eiffel Tower because of the strike.The standoff is a crucial test for the centrist French president, whose planned overhaul of the pensions system was a key election promise.The government argues that unifying the pensions system – and getting rid of the 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff – is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the French population ages. But unions say introducing a “universal” system for all will mean millions of workers in both the public and private sectors must work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or face a severe drop in the value of their pensions.The row cuts to the heart of Macron’s presidential project and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, Macron has leaned towards a Nordic style of “flexi-security” in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of iniduals moving between jobs.Pension reform is the latest step for Macron after he overhauled labour rules and changed the unemployment system, but it has always been an extremely sensitive topic in France.Unusually, the protest strike is going ahead before the full details of any pensions changes are known. A consultation process is still under way and parliament will not debate proposals until 2020.Beyond trade unions, there is an angry grassroots base of rail workers and other state workers keen to put pressure on the government. It is not certain how long the transport strike will continue.At Place de la République in central Paris, Didier Dupir from Lyon was among firefighters from the Sud trade union staging an unusual protest by sleeping outside in tents despite freezing temperatures.He was protesting over staffing levels, remuneration and pensions. “I’ve been a firefighter for 20 years and I’ve never slept out on a demonstration like this before,” he said. “This is about getting proper recognition from the government for what firefighters do. People are very sensitive to the state of public services.”Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant for Viavoice pollsters, said the public mood was of distrust rather than defiance, with people wanting pension reform but not confident in the government to carry it out.Chau said that since the gilets jaunes protests, Macron’s top-down approach to changing the French system had altered, with the government now appearing to engage in more public consultation. The challenge for the president was to balance a need for pensions changes and structural reform “while not appearing to force the changes through which could amplify the protests or generate a sense of social fracture, with different grievances joining up together”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a23ed758e173c2b9779e10807a9b07aab63499c/130_215_3370_2022/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9148f3d613c501724a7f72dba462787a","title":"malta pm joseph muscat not convincing over resignation delay say meps","story":"Pressures increases on Joseph Muscat as prime suspect in murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia testifies in court Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, is under renewed pressure to quit immediately after a European parliament delegation said the integrity of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder inquiry remained at risk while he was still in power.Muscat was “not convincing” over why he should delay his resignation until mid-January, said Sven Giegold, a German Green MEP who took part in a two-day emergency mission to Malta.On Thursday a wealthy businessman who is the prime suspect in the journalist’s murder told a Malta court he got regular tipoffs about the investigation from Keith Schembri, the former government chief of staff.Yorgen Fenech, who was charged last week for allegedly masterminding the 2017 killing, appeared in court to seek the removal of the police chief leading the case, saying he was too close to Schembri.His testimony in a packed courtroom piled further pressure on Muscat. The prime minister is a friend of Schembri, who resigned last week and was briefly arrested in connection with the investigation. He was released without charge and has denied any wrongdoing.Fenech has denied accusations of complicity in the murder and has instead blamed his close friend Schembri, who was Muscat’s righthand man and the architect of his two electoral victories. Schembri’s lawyer did not immediately reply to a request by Reuters for comment on Fenech’s testimony. Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat offers a presidential pardon to Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver from Birkirkara, in return for sharing potentially crucial evidence about the murder of the journalistYorgen Fenech, a prominent Maltese businessman, is arrested onboard his yacht as it is heading out to sea.Fenech is released on bail and placed under round-the-clock police surveillance.\u0026nbspThe Maltese prime minister’s chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and the tourism minister, Konrad Mizzi, resign. The economy minister, Chris Cardona follows them. They have all denied any wrongdoing.Details emerge that one of three men awaiting trial for the murder claimed they originally planned to shoot the journalist through a window where she often sat while working at home.Schembri is released. Muscat emerges from a marathon cabinet meeting at 3am on Friday to announce he will stay in the job until the murder investigation is complete. The European parliament agrees to send an \u0027urgent mission\u0027 to Malta over the case.Fenech is charged with complicity in Caruana Galizia’s murder.Muscat resigns. In a televised address he says he will stay on until a new leader of his ruling Labour party is elected in January.\u0026nbspThe European parliament delegation welcomed progress in the murder inquiry but said its integrity remained at risk while Muscat stayed in office. “The next 40 days will be crucial, also for trust in the integrity of the investigation,” said a statement from the MEPs.Giegold said on Thursday that Muscat told the group he would not be in a position to destroy evidence in the case. The MEP described their encounter this week as “not a friendly meeting” .Giegold said Muscat seemed quite different to the “very self-confident” man he recalled from previous meetings. “This time it was totally different. He was on the defensive. He admitted misjudgment when it came to his chief of staff, Keith Schembri.”Giegold said EU leaders would find themselves in a difficult position if Muscat attended a European council summit next week. “The decision to stay on for four more weeks puts Malta into difficulty and puts Europe into difficulty, because who wants to shake hands at the Euro summit with this prime minister,” he said.The MEP said Malta’s troubles went beyond the Caruana Galizia case. He also criticised the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for not focusing on wider problems in the EU’s smallest member state.On Wednesday Von der Leyen said she was concerned about the “recent developments in Malta” and called for “a thorough and independent investigation free from any political interference” into Caruana Galizia’s murder.The European parliament team argue that Von der Leyen’s executive, whose task is to uphold EU law, has not gone far enough. Giegold said Von der Leyen had “failed” this first test, arguing that weak rule of law was a systemic problem. The commission needed to ask “why are there no prosecutions when it comes to corruption, money laundering, large cases of financial crime”, Giegold said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Anne Marie Clifford had alleged delay of 36 minutes in getting her to hospital theatreDara Murphy should face inquiry over D\u0026aacuteil non-attendance, says Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leaderStruck-off solicitor due to stand trial next year for alleged theft of almost \u0026euro30 millionRegina Doherty offers sympathy to family for death that \u0026lsquopotentially shouldn\u0026rsquot have happened\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom not really here to interview for the job,\u0026rsquo Fred Barry tells Public Accounts CommitteeIs commuting the bane of your life or a blessing in disguise?Dr N\u0026oacuteir\u0026iacuten Russell calls on women, Department of Health, HSE to support programmeFour aged in their 20s and 30s were arrested in Dublin and Louth in connection with 2018 incidentHomeless charity says housing crisis should not be \u0026lsquoaccepted as normal\u0026rsquoAer Lingus, Ryanair announce cancellations as air-traffic controllers join in nationwide strikeProcess set up to verify women\u0026rsquos review report \u0026lsquothorough and essential\u0026rsquo, HSE saysASTI understood to have sought much larger compensation packageAgreement that ended strike to cost \u0026euro48 million this year, Department of Health saysCases follow claim of \u0026lsquopsychological injuries\u0026rsquo by former content moderator Chris GrayMixed results for Defence Forces retention schemes as strength continues to declinePatient advocate shares lack of confidence in UK college\u0026rsquos screening review processASTI likely to direct members to only attend meetings about reforms during school hoursImprovement mainly due to reduced mortality from circulatory disease and cancer"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4105787.1575557239!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin change law to investigate politicians even after leaving office","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Micheál Martin and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald TD at the switching on of the Oireachtas Christmas tree lights at Leinster House. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMicheál Martin also said that in his view the former Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy should face an inquiry.Mr Murphy resigned on Tuesday following a controversy about his non-attendance at Leinster House while claiming a Dáil salary and expenses.He has now taken up a position with the European Commission in Brussels, having spent much of the last two years working with the Fine Gael-affiliated European People’s Party.Neither the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) nor the Dáil Members’ Interests Committee can investigate complaints about Mr Murphy because he is no longer a TD.“Various mechanisms exist,” Mr Martin told The , “but I think it’s not satisfactory what has happened this weekend. Ultimately I think the public are the ultimate decision-makers in terms of the politicians, and the politicians must be accountable to the public for their actions.”In regard to Mr Murphy, he said: “he’s now not going before the people. I think the Taoiseach took a decision and Fine Gael took a decision to facilitate an arrangement with Dara Murphy which hasn’t been fully explained.“That’s unacceptable in my view, and obviously there should be mechanisms there,” Mr Martin said, adding he believed Mr Murphy should have resigned from the Dáil in 2017 when he decided to work in Europe and that there should have been an acknowledgement from the Taoiseach that what happened was wrong.Yesterday the Taoiseach told the Dáil he had spoken to Mr Murphy “about his remuneration and expenses” and the TD had confirmed he was willing to submit to any formal investigation regarding his conduct by the ethics committee or by Sipo, or to have his compliance examined by the Clerk of the Dáil.Mr Murphy has insisted he was in compliance with the Dáil’s rules for the entire period.Speaking to reporters in Derry, Mr Martin reiterated his view that Easter Sunday “marks a natural end to this Dáil” and there would be a general election shortly afterward.“We did make a commitment in the context of the threat of Brexit and a no-deal Brexit to the island of Ireland that we would not create an instability or an incoherence while the negotiations were under way,” said Mr Martin.“The 31st of January is the new deadline in terms of the deal that’s on the table . . I’ve been honourable, I’ve put the national interest first - people didn’t think we would, we did, and I’m going to follow that through.“There will be an election early in 2020 . . . I think Easter Sunday or the period up to Easter is the clear cut-off point, when the parliamentary session before Easter ends.“We’re into a general election scenario then so we’re only talking a short while,” he said.He said he did not have confidence in the capacity of Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, to deal with the homelessness crisis and said the Government has “failed in terms of housing and in terms of health”.Department of Housing figures released earlier this week showed the number of people living in emergency accommodation had risen to more than 10,000 at a time of year when such figures usually decrease.The Fianna Fáil leader was in Derry with the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who is the party’s candidate in Foyle in next week’s general election. The parties entered into a partnership earlier this year.Mr Martin addressed business leaders at a breakfast meeting and met representatives from Ulster University and Foyle Port before going canvassing with Mr Eastwood.He said he found it “inexplicable and inexcusable that the Assembly and the Executive were collapsed when they were collapsed, and that they haven’t been restored at a time when the island of Ireland is facing its greatest threat through Brexit.”Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing government since January 2017, when it collapsed following a row over a botched renewable heating scheme.Mr Martin said that it in his view this was a time of “great danger to Northern Ireland in terms of both the political vacuum and Brexit”.He said the approaching Brexit deadline on January 31st “may concentrate minds”, but he believed that “what would be of great assistance to that would be a clear message from the ballot box that we want politicians who are prepared to take their seats and who are prepared to work.“That, I think, would tip the balance in terms of the restoration of the Assembly and the Executive.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4088486.1575480045!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the free market is a rigged casino","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBy the horns: mathematician Bruce Boghosian of Tufts University and others have developed a mathematical model that accurately reproduces real-life wealth inequalities in a wide range of free-market countriesAn amazing article called The Inescapable Casino, written by mathematician Bruce Boghosian of Tufts University in the November edition of Scientific American, merits great attention. Boghosian and others have developed a mathematical model that accurately reproduces real-life wealth inequalities in a wide range of free-market countries.This model also shows that in a pure free-market economy, ie in the absence of wealth redistribution mechanisms, all the wealth inevitably falls into the hands of one or a few people (an oligarchy).Mathematical analysis such as this is critically important today because wealth inequality is escalating across the world (eg Russia, India, Brazil), particularly in the United States. Boghosian quotes the report from investment bank Credit Suisse\u0026nbspthat the fraction of global household wealth owned by the richest 1 per cent of the world’s population increased from 42.5 per cent to 47.2 per cent between the financial crisis of 2008 and 2018. Today,\u0026nbspOxfam estimates that 26 iniduals own as much household wealth as the entire bottom half of the world’s population – about 3.5 billion people.The most striking thing to me about Boghosian’s paper is the mathematical description of wealth distribution in a pure free-market system. In this economy innumerable pairs of people sell and buy goods to and from each other over and over again, agree on a price and shake hands. Assuming the system is initially symmetrical, ie everyone starts out with equal wealth, everyone acts fairly and everyone is equally industrious and bright, how will it evolve?Initial symmetry brokenWell, amazingly, to me anyway, mathematics shows that, once the initial symmetry is broken, which inevitably happens (despite their best intentions, some people will either overpay or accept less than an item is worth, thereby transferring some wealth between them), further transactions inexorably transfer all the wealth into the hands of a few iniduals, an oligarchy, and everybody else ends up with little or nothing. Living in a pure free-market is, for the great majority of people, like gambling in a casino rigged to favour the house.Of course oligarchies don’t usually arise in real-world economies because pure free-markets are subjected to modification through government-enforced redistribution of wealth from the richer to the poorer. When the mathematical model described by Boghosian is modified to accommodate typical mechanisms for redistribution of wealth, wealth distribution stabilises and oligarchies don’t appear. Applying this mathematical model to real world economies predicts the empirical data on wealth distribution in America and Europe between 1989 and 2016 with better than 2 per cent accuracy.Wealthy people enjoy various wealth-attained advantages relative to poorer people, for example lower interest rates on loans and availability of money to buy when prices are low. Factoring wealth-attained advantage into the mathematical model, and a factor to accommodate negative wealth (some people are in debt), further improves the model’s ability to predict empirical wealth distribution data.Boghosian’s modelIn Boghosian’s mathematical model, no wealthy oligarchy is possible when wealth-attained advantage is less than wealth redistribution, but when it is greater than wealth redistribution oligarchy suddenly appears. Boghosian explains that this is probably what happened when the USSR finally broke up in 1991.The former USSR republics suddenly experienced dramatically reduced government wealth redistribution, coinciding with a sharp increase in wealth-attained advantage from privatisation and deregulation. This threw these countries into a wealth-condensing state and many quickly became partial oligarchies.Boghosian’s mathematical model offers a powerful means of analysing wealth distribution in market economies, allowing governments to adjust wealth redistribution and wealth-attained advantage to ensure equitable distribution of wealth and to avoid conditions that would precipitate the emergence of oligarchies or economic stagnation (overdoing wealth redistribution would create economic stagnation, penalising everybody).Startlingly counterintuitiveThe mathematical demonstration that a pure free-market economy concentrates almost all wealth in the hands of a few, regardless of the industry or cleverness of the rest, is startlingly counterintuitive. Wealth redistribution is therefore absolutely required on scientific grounds, not exclusively on ethical-philosophical grounds, in order to set limits on inequality and to give everyone a chance to thrive.So much for the traditional notion, popular in some quarters, that redistribution of wealth is soft-hearted generosity that panders to the lazy and the shiftless and penalises the clever and the industrious.

It should be clear then after a night of counting whether prime minister Boris Johnson has the clear majority he needs to pass the withdrawal agreement, and the leaders will discuss any immediate challenges arising.The UK is due to leave the EU on January 31st if the Commons approves the withdrawal agreement, and then enters a transition period until the end of 2020, during which the old rulesrights still apply.If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the end of January, the UK crashes out in a no-deal scenario or may be allowed another extension if sought.The draft conclusions say the EU “reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK in line with the political declaration and respecting the previously agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations”.MandateTo that end the summit will mandate the commission to urgently propose a detailed mandate for the talks to the general affairs council of Europe ministers: “Negotiations should be organised in a way that makes the best possible use of the limited time available for negotiation and ratification by the end of the transition.”\u0026nbspThe aspiration to conclude such talks by the end of 2020 will be welcome in London, although there is no guarantee that the timeframe will actually be achieved.The leaders will charge the general affairs council, their ambassadors to the EU, and a specialist working group to oversee the negotiating process led by Mr Barnier “in a spirit of unity and transparency with all member states”, replicating the approach taken in the first phase of talks on the withdrawal agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It was actually revised up a bit, to 49.3 from a flash estimate of 48.6, which is better than a kick in the teeth.\u0026nbspIt stood at 50 (flat) last month. New business, meanwhile, contracted for the third month in a row, and at the fastest rate since July 2016.\u0026nbspGiven the sector’s dominance, all this bodes ill for the UK economy.\u0026nbspIt hasn’t played much of a role during the General Election but if it carries on like it this\u0026nbspit’ll be getting a lot more attention in the aftermath.\u0026nbspPolitics is behind both the gloomy picture painted of how its biggest component is performing\u0026nbspby the PMI. It’s also behind the pound’s rise from its unhealthy position on the ropes. \u0026nbspCurrency traders think it’s in the bag for Boris Johnson, that he’ll get his dismal “deal” through and that the risks of chaos will be diminished as a result. Not being overly fond of Jeremy Corbyn, they’re also quite pleased to see Labour’s poll ratings becalmed.\u0026nbspThey may be missing the bigger picture given the fraught negotiations on trade that will follow and play a big role in sentiment moving forward. How often does that need repeating? Quite a lot, it seems.\u0026nbspThe UK will simply swapping one form of uncertainty for another if Johnson wins a majority. That helps to explain why the services sector remains so weak and may continue to be weak until there is something resembling clarity on the UK’s relationship with its biggest trading partner.\u0026nbspOne of the many tragedies of Brexit is how little attention\u0026nbspservices were given during the negotiations and how little thought has been directed towards\u0026nbspthe impact Brexit will have on this crucial sector moving forward. A pick up could be some time in coming.Consumer spending, and more government money sloshing around courtesy of higher government spending, may ultimately serve keep the official GDP number from looking too bad. They’ve rescued it in the face of gloomy PMIs, which also cover the (currently no less gloomy) construction and manufacturing sectors, in the past.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlight a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the East Midlands and North East are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the last decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008.George Bangham, Research Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest ten per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the North and Midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So the ambition is to encourage students to think outside the box, and imagine an interpretation of politics that could even be considered to be positive and optimistic – politics as the avoidance of conflict.\u0026nbsp“The best responses will notice that terms like ‘war’ can mean physical acts of violence, but could also include cyber warfare, or financial piracy. And, politics could be considered at the level of states and all the way down to the level of families.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By asking this, we are looking for the candidate to think critically about experimental design, and what we can learn from the results.\u0026nbsp“For example, does the experiment have a clear hypothesis and predictions? Is it well designed to test these? Are the methods used appropriate? Does the experiment have necessary control conditions?”He added: “As well as thinking critically, we’re also looking for the candidate to think creatively, for example about how the experiment could be improved and what the results of such an experiment might tell us about how people think and how the brain works.”The advice comes as thousands of prospective students are due to attend interviews at the university this month.Dr Khan said: “There are no trick questions, everything that we ask has a purpose, and that is to show us how a student thinks and responds to new ideas and information, in an academic conversation akin to the tutorials that they will take part in if they come to Oxford to study.”University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New users are also able to simply lie about their age in order to set up an account.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Historically, we didn’t require people to tell us their age because we wanted Instagram to be a place where everyone can express themselves fully – irrespective of their identity,” Instagram wrote in a blog post.\u0026nbsp“In the spirit of that decision, we won’t show people’s birthday information to others in the community.”Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Instagram also said it would recommend younger users to choose stronger privacy settings to prevent strangers from contacting or following them.Age information would “keep young people safer and enable more age-appropriate experiences overall,” the app said.Under the US Child Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa), it is illegal for tech companies to gather data on anyone under 13. However, consumer advocacy groups claim that Facebook has consistently violated Coppa\u0026nbsp by profiting from the data collection of children.\u0026nbspFacebook apps account for nearly half of all child abuse reports“Tech companies like Facebook have built a business model based on harvesting, analysing, and selling massive amounts of user data, including the data of vulnerable people like children – putting all of us at risk,”\u0026nbspEvan Greer, campaign director at US digital rights group Fight For the Future, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast year.Beyond illegal data gathering, fears have also been raised about online child sex crimes taking place on Facebook-owned apps.A study published this week revealed that nearly half of all online child sex abuse took place across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in 2018.\u0026nbspIn the UK, around 1,000 of instances reported to the police took place on Instagram.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We\u0027re a country with 150 billionaires, and we\u0027ve still got people sleeping on the streets,” the Labour leader said, when quizzed on whether he would use the grace-and-favour mansion.But Mr Corbyn got into a tangle after saying he “usually” watches the Queen’s Christmas Day\u0026nbspmessage – then mistakenly claiming it is shown in the morning.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDuring the interview on ITV, he also declined to set out the most romantic thing he has done, saying: “Wow, that\u0027s a hard one. Nobody ever thinks of me as romantic.”And, asked for “the most romantic sort of wild and reckless thing you’ve ever done”, Mr Corbyn replied: “You can\u0027t ask that question on television.”John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has already said he would give up Dorneywood, the country pile offered to chancellors of the exchequer and open it to the public instead.On ITV, Mr Corbyn was asked: “Would you consider giving up Chequers if you were prime minister?”, replying: “I would indeed.”He was also asked: “Do you sit down to watch the Queen\u0027s Speech?”, telling the interviewer, Julie Etchingham: “It\u0027s on the morning, usually we have it on – some of the time.”She replied: “It’s not on in the morning, it’s at three o’clock in the afternoon,” prompting Mr Corbyn to say: “It’s when its repeated, in the afternoon.”Created with Sketch.

Obviously, like everybody else does.“And, I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day, or the day before, to talk to, and listen to people\u0027s lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them.”Mr Corbyn was also asked it was embarrassing that he said he would confront Donald Trump at Buckingham Palace, but did not actually manage to speak to him.Still no date for Johnson grilling, says Andrew NeilTrump is lying when he says he’s not interested in the NHSInside Politics: PM dodges photo with US president despite No 10 talksJohnson accused of ‘insulting’ voters over no-deal Brexit danger“Not in the slightest,” he said. “Absolutely not in the slightest.

Of course, that includes President Trump, yes.”Asked how he would form a good relationship with Mr Trump, the Labour leader said he would “work out issues that we agree on”He would then “try and persuade him on both trade issues and particularly on climate change and the importance of the Paris Climate Change\u0026nbspAccord”.“I hope we can go further than Paris because we cannot go on allowing global warming to carry on at this rate.

But, writes Ashley Cowburn, now it’s at a crossroadsA parasitic organisation, a bit of rabble, proof of a Trotskyist infiltration, a theatrical cult. These were just a handful of the phrases used to describe Momentum, the group of activists on the left of the Labour Party, in its early days. They would have likely been far worse had one of the other names put forward been chosen: swarm.“Look, when you ask people to come up with ideas for names, what they do is they can think of two or three good ones, or reasonable ones, and then try to make up the numbers,” says founder Jon Lansman. “I think Swarm wasn’t even on the bottom rung. That got the biggest laugh.”The grassroots organisation was set up by Lansman, alongside Adam Klug, Emma Rees and James Schneider, in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership success. They had all worked on the Labour leader’s surprise victory, and sought to harness the energy behind that campaign to build a social movement supporting Corbyn’s left-wing policy agenda – drawing inspiration from anti-austerity movements in Europe, including Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFour years later, sitting in Momentum’s Finsbury Park office, serving as an election headquarters close to the Labour leader’s constituency office, Lansman, who is wearing an orange tie-dye Grateful Dead T-shirt, reflects on the name they eventually chose. “It’s very difficult when you’re trying to think of a name\u0026nbsppeople associate the word with what they think the words means, rather than what they think it will become once you create a big organisation which has a big effect. And then the word acquires a completely new meaning which is how people see what Momentum became. Obviously it reflected the momentum that increased during the course of the leadership campaign.”What Momentum became is a group boasting 40,000 members paying a minimum of £3 per month that has put itself at the forefront of Labour’s push to win next week’s general election, raising £500,000 in donations to be used on canvassing by its army of activists and innovative digital campaigning. But that is a far cry from where it all began.\u0026nbspAs Corbyn’s popularity grew in the 2015 leadership contest, those intimately involved in the campaign decided a separate organisation was required to ensure the energy from the tens of thousands of members who joined Labour did not dissipate. Lansman, who had cut his teeth 34 years earlier in Tony Benn’s deputy leadership campaign, crucially\u0026nbsphad also kept the email list of Corbyn supporters.Welcoming its eventual launch, Corbyn said at the time: “We need to put our values, the people’s values, back into politics. To do this, we need to keep up the momentum we have built over the last four months.”\u0026nbspBut today, Lansman admits Momentum launched “before we were ready”, adding: “We didn’t have a constitution, we’d had all these groups spring up around the country organically, we didn’t organise them.\u0026nbspWe didn’t have the rules, we tried to impose – because we launched without a constitution – we tried to impose some rules on them.”“It was a turbulent time,” Lansman adds. “We had people who weren’t members of the party, people who perhaps had paid £3 to vote, but had decided not to join the party. It was a difficult time to establish an organisation, but we did and we have established a new, left organisation, with a culture that is very different from any left organisation.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMomentum faced considerable conflict with the party’s MPs at Westminster over the highly contentious issue of deselections. Those opposed to the party’s new leadership viewed the organisation as a threatening force, seeking to purge critics of Corbyn from the Labour Party, while activists pointed to increasing internal democracy and enfranchising party members.\u0026nbspThe threshold for MPs to be “triggered” was reduced at last year’s Labour conference, and Lansman says there is still “further to go” in handing party members more powers – pointing to the group’s failure, so far, to introduce “open selections”.\u0026nbspThere’s a tendency with journalists to demonise Momentum. I’ve met Momentum members of all shapes and sizes“It would have been much better to have open selections where people make positive choices for the candidate they thought would best represent them, rather than having to make negative choices about not wanting a particular person, which I think is more isive,” he adds.\u0026nbspCritics included former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who famously denounced the Trotskyist group Militant at the 1985 party conference. Ahead of the first The World Transformed in 2016 – a festival at Labour conference by Momentum activists – he said the “sectarian ultra-left” speaking at the organisation’s events risked endangering the party as a political force.\u0026nbspHis concern, he added, was that decent and enthusiastic young people were being “manipulated” by “people from the hard left organising in a less-than-transparent way to secure their aged-old objective, the control of the Labour Party”.But, speaking in the dining room of her home in Hackney, east London, Diane Abbott dismisses the criticism of the organisation. “If Neil Kinnock knows more than a dozen Momentum members, I’d be surprised,” the shadow home secretary says. “What he is doing is confusing them with Militant, but they are a different thing.\u0026nbsp“The point about Momentum is that it was people who were either in the party or, crucially, joined the party to support Jeremy Corbyn – that’s who they are. There’s a tendency with journalists to demonise Momentum. I’ve met Momentum members of all shapes and sizes, some of them have never been in the party, some of them are very young, some of them are a bit closer to me in age.”But Lansman acknowledges there have been periods of ision, including the “difference of view on antisemitism” allegations. Shortly after Momentum’s inaugural gathering at the Labour Party conference in 2016, Jackie Walker, who was then the organisation’s vice chair, was stripped of\u0026nbspher position after considerable criticism of her remarks about Holocaust Memorial Day. “In terms of Holocaust day, wouldn’t it be wonderful if Holocaust day was open to all people who experienced Holocaust?” she told a fringe event. Walker was expelled from Labour earlier this year and has made a film, called Witch Hunt, about her experiences.After Corbyn defeated an attempt to oust him as leader in 2016, the organisation was no longer just a Praetorian guard for the Labour leader during periods of instability. Sweeping changes to the organisation were rapidly executed in early 2017, and Momentum announced it would affiliate to the Labour Party itself. It meant its grassroots supporters were required to be, or become members of, the national party. Those who were expelled from Labour could no longer operate within the organisation.It then turned its firepower to mobilising activists in marginal seats across the country, using\u0026nbspinnovative forms of digital campaigning. A developed version of its 2017 snap election app “My Nearest Marginal”, pioneered\u0026nbspby Bernie Sanders’ team during the US democratic primaries, which directed activists to areas where canvassing was required, has been created for the December election.\u0026nbspMomentum’s tactics also won plaudits from unlikely quarters in the aftermath of Theresa May’s failed gamble to win a greater Conservative majority. Giles Kenningham, a former director of communications for the party, commented: “Labour have used Momentum to devastating effect. The Tories do not have an equivalent group pushing out their message”.\u0026nbspIt is still the situation today that the Conservatives have no equivalent. Within days of MPs agreeing to fight a general election, Momentum dwarfed the funds it raised at the last poll. Staffing at Momentum has been increased from 15 to 55 full-time members, funded by almost half a million pounds of donations, and over 1,400 volunteers have pledged to take an average of two weeks out of work to campaign for a Labour government.\u0026nbspThe digital side is coordinated\u0026nbspfrom the north London office space where activists have a paper countdown of “days until socialism” plastered to the wall. The upgraded app – “My Campaign Map” – has had over 1.4 million views and gives advice to Labour campaigners on where they can make the biggest impact. In the week after MPs voted for an early election, the organisation coordinated “Super Saturday” through the app with thousands of activists hitting the streets.One activist, 32-year-old Jessica Adams, a cultural studies student and Momentum member, claims the app had been “really, really helpful” and she had visited constituencies\u0026nbspacross the UK, including Chingford and Woodford Green, Kensington, Battersea and Aberconwy. Adams says “My Campaign Map” has been “really effective”, adding that hundreds turned out in Chingford, where the Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen is attempting to unseat the senior Conservative Iain Duncan Smith and wipe out his slim 2017 majority of just over 2,400.The journalist and Labour activist\u0026nbspOwen Jones, who has spent time across the country during the election campaign, says Momentum has played a “pivotal role in mobilising activists” and has helped get activists knocking on doors in both defensive and offensive constituencies. “Momentum played a huge role in just getting people to knock on doors, listen to people and get the critical information needed to pinpoint who the undecided voters are.”Lansman: ‘We are the new mainstream’In his Westminster office – the day after the Labour leadership signed up to a winter election – John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and close ally of Corbyn, describes Momentum as “one of the most successful things that’s happened” to the party. “It’s been a real asset to us all the way through – more than Jeremy, it’s an asset for the Labour Party”.McDonnell adds: “It’s just a huge activist organisation, in terms of enthusiastic members – most of them young people. What’s interesting, they are very professional about how they operate, they are young people who come up with really creative ideas about how to mobilise, how to engage with people, and their social media presence is so effective. They have these training sessions with people about how to engage in conversation on the doorstep, how to use the right language, how to ensure you actually listen.”For Momentum, the big question is: what happens next? After finding relevance fighting for Corbyn in two leadership battles, and now, two general elections, the group is keeping one eye on its next step. A major shift came earlier this year, and had a rippling effect at Labour’s annual conference on the Brighton seafront. Momentum began lobbying for policies that went beyond Corbyn’s existing blueprint for a socialist Britain, including a four-day working week, the abolition of immigration detention centres, and a green new deal focused on achieving zero carbon by 2030. “Radical and transformative policy can’t only come from the halls of Westminster,” a spokesperson declared at the time. “It must come from Labour’s half a million members.”\u0026nbspAttempting to reinvigorate activists demoralised by Labour’s triangulation on Brexit, for the first time the group found itself publicly demanding a more radical programme for government than the one on offer. After all, one of its founding values was to support Corbyn’s left-wing policy agenda, not just the leader himself. It could also be viewed as the organisation re-establishing itself for one of two scenarios: a post-Corbyn Labour Party, or a Corbyn government.\u0026nbspFor the latter, it is how to remain relevant having played a major role in installing one of the most left-wing administrations in Downing Street in British political history. It is clear there is no intention of winding down when this ultimate goal has been achieved. Instead, it will be about ensuring there is “demonstrable public support” for key elements in Labour’s “boldest and most ambitious programme since 1945”, such as the green new deal that Lansman believes will come under attack in parliament from the Conservatives and opposition parties. “I don’t have any doubt that Jeremy and John McDonnell are committed to that programme,” he says. “I think that doesn’t mean to say no pressure is required to ensure that the Labour Party as a whole sticks with its guns.”Jones believes that if Labour forms a government after the snap election, “all hell would break lose from an establishment which is not very happy at all with that form of government”.\u0026nbspHe adds that Momentum’s role in this scenario would be to continue mobilising in communities, but also putting pressure on a Labour administration.\u0026nbspHe says: “It shouldn’t just be an auxiliary wing of the Labour leadership. Already you’ve seen Momentum put pressure on the Labour leadership to shifting position on anything from the rights of migrants, which the Labour leadership have been quite depressing on since the referendum, and other issues like being more radical on the climate emergency.“In government, Momentum should put pressure on the Labour leadership if it wasn’t to fulfil radical promises – it’s not there to be a Corbyn fanclub, it’s there to fight for socialist policies.”But as Laura Parker, a former private secretary to the Labour leader and now national coordinator at Momentum, said at the beginning of the campaign: the party has a “mountain to climb” to achieve victory and deprive Johnson of a majority Conservative government. Lansman points to Labour’s recent improvement in the polls – a BMG survey for The Independent showed the party had cut the Conservative lead to just six points at the weekend. He believes a “great number of seats” are within target if Labour’s position improves, but on the prospect of a majority Labour government he admits: “That is obviously a lower chance than us being in some kind of minority government, but I think there’s an excellent chance of that and that is absolutely what we’re working for. That’s why we’re targeting offensively, because we want to win, and we think we can win.”For the former scenario, however, it is how Momentum reasserts itself if Corbyn is defeated at the first December general election for almost a century. According to last week’s polling model by YouGov, which accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election, Labour is on course for its worst election result since 1983 when Michael Foot was at the helm of the party. If it is proved correct a second time, Corbyn would be under immense pressure to resign.\u0026nbspMomentum will probably play a key role in the resulting leadership contest, and if it decides to throw its powerful caucus behind a left-wing candidate, that inidual will have a considerable chance of victory. But for now, at least, Lansman is unwilling to entertain life after Corbyn. “We’re focused on winning, we’re not focused on losing, or losing badly,” he says. “I think Jeremy should step down when he wants to step down. I think that is matter to be considered – these are matters to be considered when we, after the election. I don’t expect there actually be a very rapid decision. There will only be one week before Christmas at that point. I’m expecting him to be putting a cabinet together in that week.”But one thing is clear: there will be no closing down of operations at Momentum should Labour lose the election and Corbyn decide it is time to step aside. “The wilderness years are over whatever the outcome of this election,” Lansman adds. It’s a reference to his own return from political irrelevance and the left’s position on the fringes of the Labour movement. “The Labour Party has shifted big time. Actually British politics has shifted against austerity big time. That was achieved actually as soon as Jeremy won. Theresa May was already trying to park her tanks on our lawn, claiming that austerity was over,” he says. “I’m not going back to the wilderness, no, absolutely. I and Momentum are here for the long run.“We are here for the long run, and we will deal with whatever the result of the election is.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlight a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the East Midlands and North East are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the last decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008.George Bangham, Research Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest ten per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the North and Midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clearly it takes courage to stand before an audience charged with being funny enough to quieten the clink of cutlery.But let’s be frank. He is simply another BBC comedian with acceptable views.BBC-approved comedians dominate the maintained sector of British comedy.Auntie is the superpower of sponsored satire, scattering municence in the direction of any up-and-coming talent with a neat line in attacking approved targets: The patriarchy, Brexit, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Tories, country-sports enthusiasts, royalists and Priti Patel. You get the picture.Of course, not all comedians rely on such sketches. But those that don’t often pay the price.Take talented young comedian Alistair Williams, who shot to prominence off the back of a sketch in which he likened Brexit to being stuck in a Burger King you have voted to leave. His video soon went viral.But as he noted on Twitter the next day: “Because I am a comedian that supports Brexit, you can no longer find me on the comedy club circuit.”There are exceptions. Pro-Brexit comedian Geoff Norcott is gradually finding his way on to a few BBC shows.Simon Evans is a successful comic who parodies his own upper-middle class, right-of-centre viewpoint, while occasionally getting in an anti-leftist dig along the way.But compare that to the roll call of liberal-left comics who pop up on the BBC: Ed Byrne, Dara O Briain, Marcus Brigstocke, Jolyon Rubinstein, Sandi Toksvig, Mitchell and Webb, Mark Steel, Mark Thomas, Jo Brand, Andy Parsons, Russell Howard and Stewart Lee.These and others form a rolling castlist for the BBC’s many radio and TV  and sketch shows, trotting out the same takes to approving titters from audiences apparently bussed in en-masse from North London.A few weeks ago, after enduring a standard Have I Got News For You anti-Brexit fest, I turned over to watch Mock The Week on BBC to see host Dara O Briain tell a list of Malaysian heritage he wouldn’t be welcome in the Brexit Party .I vented about it on Twitter because whatever you think of the Brexit Party, it has been notably erse since its inception. O Briain’s lazy smear made no sense.It quickly transpired the one Malaysian-born person to achieve senior elected office in the UK is Christina Jordan, who is the Brexit Party’s MEP for Gibraltar and the South West.Soon she was giving O Briain an ear-bashing.His retort was that he got a laugh from the studio audience because that was what they thought of the Brexit Party.No wonder, eh Even some of those on the BBC’s roster have clocked that their unormity of outlook might be a problem.Brigstocke spoke in  of the shock of seeing audience members walk out of his show during his anti-Brexit segment when he took it on tour round the country.But comedy as a whole shows few signs of coming to terms with the case for more erse thinking.Most of us not on the Left do not close our minds to the possibility of those we disagree with still being funny.The late Jeremy Hardy’s Tory takedowns on Radio ’s The News Quiz were brilliant.But most comics don’t work hard enough to offer such original material.Jo Brand’s joke about battery acid being thrown over politicians is a case in point.We get she probably doesn’t really wish that on anyone. It is another way for her to say she doesn’t like particular politicians.We knew that.Thankfully, salvation is at hand.An independent sector is sprouting up, taking advantage of social media and hosting free-thinking comedy nights.Lee Hurst, a veteran whose broadcast career was curtailed for not being reliably left-wing, is a patron of the scene.In performers such as Williams, Norcott, Evans and Titania McGrath satirist Andrew Doyle — plus free-wheeling left-wingers such as Francesca Martinez and American Rob Delaney — we see the makings of a new alternative-comedy scene.Seek them out, ditch the BBC and have a laugh.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the small print admits most of this cash, £, comes from making homes more energy ­efficient and Labour say that programme will not be finished until .On water, Labour say the Tories have cost families £ a year and they will save them £. But critics say their plan to renationalise water will end in higher prices.Corbyn  Co also say the average home has forked out an extra £ over the last decade for broadband and vow to save them £ by making it free. But the bills only rose by £ and the proposed saving — again — will only come in .Labour’s plans to slash rail ticket prices to save homes £, were also mocked as just ten per cent of Brits commute to work, meaning most won’t see a penny of the cash.And its childcare claims fail to include the £billion a year the Government pays out.Mr McDonnell insisted the figures were “objectively assessed”.But Tory vice chairman Paul Scully said: “It’s clear Corbyn just can’t be straight with people.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Averyanov, at his daughter’s wedding wearing grey suit and bow tie.Intelligence officials in the four Western countries who have identied the unit say it is unclear how often it mobilisedThey warn that it is impossible to know when and where its operatives will strike next.“This is a unit of the G.R.U. that has been active over the years across Europe,” said one security official.“It’s been a surprise that the Russians, the G.R.U., this unit, have felt free to go ahead and carry out this extreme malign activity in friendly countries. That’s been a shock.”Petrov and Boshirov - suspected to be travelling under aliases - arrived in the country at Gatwick Airport before getting a train from London to Salisbury.Incredible CCTV footage shows the pair - who are believed to be in the s - smiling as they stroll through the city on the day of the Skripal attack.Police said Novichok was brought into Britain in a Nina Ricci ‘Premier Jour’ perfume bottle with a specially made poison applicator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last December election in the UK was held in  and hearing political debates in the midst of John Lewis ads jars slightly like, don’t they know it’s Christmas  I would so much rather be knee-deep in crackers, Secret Santa and turkey stuffing rather than thinking about the election and I don’t even celebrate Christmas that much. Given the dreary weather I have more chance of catching a cold than I have of contracting election fever. I wasn’t always so apathetic. As a bright-eyed, bushy-eyebrowed child I invented my own political party called The Preservatives- But We’re Not Articial- which espoused traditional British values like handing your homework in on time and not dropping litter. I would watch party political broadcasts for fun and remember being blown away by Neil Kinnock’s legendary speech at the Labour conference back in . But then le takes over. You get older and realise that whoever gets in things it all just gets harder. I don’t just feel squeezed, I feel like I’m constantly being punched in the face. I live in the Labour stronghold of Bradford West. Maverick George Galloway briefly became our MP for the Respect Party but he didn’t last long and the seat swung back- hard- to Labour.  The community has largely always been pro-Labour but there has also been a move towards the Tories among those who see themselves as upwardly mobile and conservative with a small ‘c’. People say the Referendum unleashed a tidal wave of racism I have witnessed a man in the supermarket look at a family of Asians and say: “At least after Brexit we won’t see so many of them.” But Brexit itself is not that straightforward for us here. I have been told to go back home in broken English by a man newly arrived from Eastern European. Considering I was born and raised here that really is ironic. The city also voted Leave. So how do I feel about the two leaders  With Corbyn I know he has principles. He cares about the poor, the disadvantaged, the destitute.

They claimed the Brexit Partyaposs campaigning in next weekaposs election will split the Leaver vote and gt Labour victories in key seats.But they refused to quit as MEPs - meaning they will cling on to their £, salaries in Brussels and Strasbourg - despite being elected on a Brexit Party ticket in only May this year. One of the four MEPs, Lucy Harris, said: “We’re not going to stand down because we want to be in the European Parliament voting for Boris Johnson’s deal.” Another of the four, Lance Forman, added: “For our four votes we want to be able to use them on this one crucial occasion so we won’t be stepping down as MEPs.” It came after Ms Rees-Mogg said it was unbelievable but tragic that Farageaposs outfit are now the very party risking Brexit.” And Mr Forman said Nigel Farage might have to eat his pride, adding: He’s done an extraordinary job of getting us to this point. “He could be one of the greatest statesmenhe stood down and said ‘I believe we have to get Brexit delivered, vote for Boris Johnson and his deal.’” Nigel Farage lashed out at the four defectors with a spokesman saying three of the four had Tory links - including Ms Rees-Mogg. In chaotic scenes outside the defectorsapos Westminster press conference, a Brexit Party spokesman claimed we’ve known about attempts to bribe people for weeks.”  Yet the spokesman admitted he had no evidence the four were offered roles or peerages to switch sides. Police launched a probe last month after Mr Farage claimed Tory figures offered inducements to his candidates to step down - claims the Tories strenuously deny.

Over the past decade we have seen severe cuts to youth services, the closure of over  youth centres and an embarrassing failure to act on the climate emergency. This blatant disregard for the future of our generation has led to young people feeling severely let down.As one student told me in Southampton the joy of being young is that a world of opportunity awaits, but for this generation, it feels asthose opportunities are closing in on us by the day. The main concern for myself and youth organisations across the country is whether or not we decide to do anything about it.The silver-lining to the Government neglecting us is that it has now inspired one of the most powerful forces in political history - the youth movement. Analysts, pollsters and political figures are waiting in anticipation to see whether the rhetoric will be backed up by action. Will young people capitalize on the most powerful form of democratic accountability  As the Founder and CEO of YouthPolitics UK, I have spoken to thousands of young adults in universities and sixth forms across the country. It appears the question is notthey are motivated to turnout and vote - they are. In fact, they have registered to vote in their masses. The question really is, do they have anyone to vote for  It is no secret that the vast majority of young people want to remain in the European Union and embrace a world in which we celebrate ersity and tolerance. Yet the lack of a credible option for young people to vote for encapsulates the sad state of our politics. Memories of the Liberal Democrats failing our generation on the issue of tuition fees remain stark in our minds. Divisions within the Labour Party and its failure to tackle anti-Semitism contradict the very values that we as a generation stand for. Indeed, the leader of the Conservative Party couldn’t even be bothered to stand up and debate climate change, the greatest issue facing our generation, with the other party leaders. There is something that all political leaders should understand in the run up to this election. Young people will decide who enters Number  on December th, so listen to us.

The woman, named only as Rachel, tearfully told of her struggle to make sure her son is fed and has a roof over his head as she put down four p pieces and six pence coins. She was featured in a special general election report as BBC News visited Grimsby to to speak to voters who are relying on foodbanks. Rachel hit out at politicians, saying they donapost understand what itaposs like to go without basic necessities or to struggle as a single parent. Are you a struggling parent  Email your story to webnews@mirror. The single mum invited the news crew into the temporary accommodation she shares with her teenage son, Bradley, after a visit to the Rock Foundation foodbank, GrimsbyLive reports. She emptied her pockets to show how much money she had. She told the BBC through tears: “That’s all our money”. Asked what her biggest concerns are, Rachel said: “Making sure my son is fed and has a roof over his head for the time being.  “If I didn’t have him I wouldn’t be here. I know I wouldn’t. It’s because of him I’m still here.” The programme touched on votersapos distrust of politicians. Rachel said: “Sometimes I think they don’t deserve it [my vote] because they don’t get, they don’t understand, what it’s like to be without.” On the topic of Brexit, which has dominated the campaign, she said: “The situation I’m in, it can’t get any worse.”  The programme featured a number of locals who rely on community shops and foodbanks. Many told how they had no faith in the political class. Pam Hodge, of the Rock Foundation, told how Grimsby was getting “worse every year” as it battled poverty and unemployment. Askedshe knew who she would vote for on December , she said: “Not at the moment, no. And who do you believe  We see all this poverty, all this desperation, every single day. But I don’t know who I will vote for. Who do you believe ”  In Grimsby, one in four residents are on low incomes and one in two children grow up in poverty. A new report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which works to tackle poverty in the UK, has found that low-income voters wield a lot of power in the upcoming election, but are largely ignored by political parties. The report said low-income voters are a large segment of the electorate, with about .million in total. Of those, .million can be characterised as swing voters. It also found that about one million Britons on low incomes - including , swing voters - are planning to vote for the first time next week. The foundation has urged political parties to listen to low-income voters, saying they have increasing power but continue to be locked out of policy-making and debate. Sixteen childrenaposs charities, led by Children in Scotland, have released an alternative election manesto, urging parties to tackle everything from poverty to climate change. The manesto urges the next government to end the benefit cap and readopt legally binding targets to reduce child poverty. Juliet Harris, Director of Together , one of the groups supporting the manesto, said: “It is shameful that in , child poverty is one of the most signicant human rights issues across the UK.

It looks like it will be raining in the south and showery in the north. There could be a few flurries of snow but it will be confined to the hills and not hit lower levels. Weaposre expecting it to be quite breezy, even windy in the south, and it will be a little colder than normal - maybe by one degree.  Weaposre not expecting apocalyptic snow but there might be a touch of frost.  Thereaposs no concrete evidence that the weather , either good or bad, affects voter turnout during elections. However, some believe bad weather could spell bad news for Labour as voters may be more likely to be put off by rain - mainly because theyaposre less likely to have cars.Itaposs widely held that Tory voters are older and more likely to vote - so will make it to the polls no matter what the weather. They are also more likely to have a car and live closer to a polling station.

Not to have his festive spirit diminished, the father-of-four blew the note up and printed it out in A.

When Billy posted the note on social media friends and family flocked to the family to show their support.

Protests due to President Emmanuel Macronaposs plans to overhaul the countryaposs retirement system has seen travel in and out of the country hit. Those on a pre-Christmas get-away to the theme park have spoken out at the chaos which threatens to wreck their plans. Daryl Moran, an electrical engineer from Merseyside, said he and his family had their flights changed as they were travelling to Disneyland. Mr Moran told the PA news agency: It was a surprise for my eldest daughter, who is eight next week. She is absolutely heartbroken that we are missing a full day there now. The walkout has affected most of the Paris underground system, as well as Eurostar journeys and flights.Air France said about  per cent of its domestic flights would be cancelled, with Easyjet, British Airways and Ryanair also cancelling many of their flights to and from France.Mr Moran said: We should have arrived at Paris .am local time, we will arrive in Paris now at pm local time. We have been at the airport since am. We had no idea of the strike, weaposve received no emails off our airline Flybe nor the travel agent Hays Travel, he claimed. No tickets are available on Eurostar trains until Tuesday, with the company saying it had cancelled almost  services between now and then. Sophia Massey, who is also travelling to Disneyland, said: Itaposs a nightmare, I booked with Hays Travel for my daughteraposs birthday and now we have to fly to Southampton and then connect to Paris from there, we are losing a day in Disneyland Paris. We booked this as a surprise, sheaposs in floods of tears. Eurostar will operate a reduced timetable until December , however some trade union leaders have said they will keep the strikes up until Mr Macron abandons his campaign promise to overhaul the retirement system. Mr Moran said: We are really upset as it has spoilt our surprise for our daughter and are a little annoyed that weaposre losing a full day.

Residents including parents with pushchairs have been forced to walk in the road to get round the eyesore. Mixed into the ft mound of muck is bags of clothes, cupboards, a fridge-freezer, a headboard and broken parts of a sofa. The rubbish has now been on the Birmingham pavement since Friday, November . Shaun McRobert, , said: “Most of the pathway is blocked, people are being forced to walk into the road and speeding is a really bad problem here. It’s an eyesore - having to walk past that every day is a joke. It should have been removed by now, it’s a health and safety thing.” There could be broken glass, anything inside of there, one little mistake and someone could end up getting hurt. Bader, , said he was particularly affected as the waste spilled across the front of his house. He added: It’s really bad, we have trouble getting out of the house with the prams. It’s going to attract rats, mice and it’s going to affect my house because I am the one closest. It’s too dangerous and you have to walk in the road to get out, it’s really annoying.”  Nabil Guennoun claimed not to have seen anything this bad in his five years of living in the street. The -year-old said: It’s no good, it’s dangerous, especially when all the cars are parked, he said. One resident, who asked not be named, said it was a major inconvenience to her and her family. She said: When you’re walking with the kids you have to walk around it, it’s dangerous. The leaves and mud are a mess in itself but to have that - it’s just messy. We’ve had this kind of behaviour forever. There’s rubbish that stays there for weeks and weeks and nothing is done. The manager of the property behind where the rubbish was dumped said the mess was due to a previous tenant.  He said: I’m a victim, just like everybody . On Wednesday afternoon he said efforts were being made to remove the rubbish by the evening. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: “Following reports from member of the public, we were made aware of this incident - which is now being investigated. As it is under investigation we cannot make any further comment in detail.

As I ring the bell at Bubbles, a pair of eyes give me the once-over through the gap of a little hatch in the door. The owners and workers at Bubbles Spa have no idea who I am and why Iaposm here. Just an ordinary punter on a cold and rainy evening, looking for a sensual massage. My heart is pounding. The owner of the eyes peering through the door seems satisfied that I am no threat to security or the women who work here.  Iaposm let in and led to a vestibule, where a woman apologises for smelling of cigarettes. She asks for a name and I give her one. Someone aposs name. The name of a friend, in fact. It was the first to come into my head. She must be used to this. She has clocked me as a Bubbles virgin and explains the tarfs. It’s £ to get in the building for a massage but for an extra fiver you get an hour, rather than  minutes. I decline. Thirty minutes is probably enough. Maybe this is a special offer for this evening. Then you have to pay for the actual massage. Fishnet stockings and a lacy bra Prices start at £ and for that you get a massage from a scantily clad woman.  For £ your masseuse will be topless, for £ sheaposll be naked and £ gets you a massage in one of the VIP rooms.  I pay the initial £ quid in cash and wonder how the finance department will view my expenses claim for a sensual erotic massage at Bubbles. In the waiting room, I find a woman sitting on a settee wearing a short black tunic with buttons diagonally dotted down the front, fishnet stockings, a lacy bra and pants set. Enough buttons of her tunic are undone for her bra to be visible. Given her attire, youaposd perhaps expect a pair of heels but sheaposs wearing what look like black trainers. They look slightly incongruous. Still,you work on your feet, it makes sense to wear flats. There does not seem to be any other clients while I’m there.  Seeing someone you recognise might feel awkward and potentially blow my cover. Hello dad, fancy seeing you here. Long time no see, Reverend. That kind of conversation. The woman leads me down a corridor into a massage room then leaves me to shower. I wash and wrap a towel around myself. There is a hair on the soap in the cubicle. Is it one of mine  Maybe. The place is clean,a little shabby in places. aposDo you want me naked apos On hershe asks whether I want to be massaged with oil or lotion and explains that oil gets to your muscles more easily. Lotion is quicker to wash off, she explains. I opt for oil. Do you want me naked  I ask. She does. OK. The towel is draped over a chair and Iaposm naked in front of a woman I met just minutes earlier. This is a first, for what itaposs worth.  Thereaposs tinny music coming from the TV in the waiting room. I lie face down on the massage table, feeling very exposed. At least itaposs warm. She starts to work her hands up my thighs. In the mirror on the wall I can see her legs. Her tunic isn’t long enough to cover her buttocks and I can see her underwear as the tunic rises and falls with the rhythm as she bends over to work her hands across my legs. There is small talk. I concoct a dreary back-story about where I work. She says itaposs been quiet because weaposre approaching Christmas. When the weather ’s bad or the football’s on it’s totally dead, she says.Perhaps Derby County supporters make up a big proportion of the clientele, I suggest. They might come later andthey do they’re sometimes totally out of their faces. They can be a bit of a handful, she explains. Lots of the girls have their own regular customers though. She talks about worries for her family and the future. Sheaposs self-employed sothe clients dry up then so does her income. It is like the kind of conversation when you’re at the barbers. Only in the buff, obviously. You get to be the masseuse She tries the soft sell. With naked massage you have the option of body massage where the woman will massage you with her breasts. Just thought I’d let you know this for future reference. You can give the girl a massage as well, like a reverse massage, she says. I ask: Do you get many massages   Yes, especially in the VIP rooms, she says. You’ve got a Jacuzzi as well. Is that part of the VIP package  Yeh, we’ve got two VIP rooms, one with the Jacuzzi when the lady will assist you into the Jacuzzi either before or after your massage, she says. The lady will come into the Jacuzzi with you. It’s your choice whether you have it before or after your massage. Itaposs doubtful my expenses claim would stretch to the Jacuzzi package. Naked and exposed In the other room we have a double bed. It’s a lot better for the body-to-body massage and the reverse massage. It’s quite popular, especially the bedroom one, she explains. The massage table Iaposm on is quite narrow and to get two people on safely presents a risk of falling off.  Do you want to turn over sweetheart  she asks. I roll over onto my back and feel more naked and more exposed. There is a mirror on the ceiling too. I’ve never felt more naked. I watch her work the oil into my thighs, stomach and chest.

Paula Lydamore, , from Clton, Nottinghamshire, was diagnosed with type one diabetes when she was just five years old. Doctors have told her she will eventually go blind due to a rare complication known as diabetic retinopathy, where the retina is damaged due to high blood sugar levels. Ms Lydamore says her vision is so impaired that she feels asshe has been flashbanged due to a distracting white light that hampers her vision.It has been a nightmare, she told NottinghamshireLive .If it was not for having to be with my son I think I would have just given up. I cannot play on my phone, I cannot read properly, I cannot do anything. It is really disorientating. I went to walk my little boy to school andit was not for him shouting me I would have walked out into the road and into a car. I canapost even do that anymore. I just end up staring into thin air. Ms Lydamore is now reliant on the help of her ex-partner, Alan Fallows, who has become her carer, and her son, Kyden. They have been left in a desperate situation after accommodation in Loughborough, Leicestershire, had fallen through. They had no other options but to seek help from Nottingham City Councilaposs housing aid team. The organisation have offered her numerous temporary accommodation options but were deemed unsuitable due to her needs. Nottingham City Council said it realised the emergency bed and breakfast accommodation she was first helped into was not ideal and herself. Kyden and Mr Fallows agreed to be placed into a family hostel after declining the first offer, arguing it was simply not suitable for someone who is partially blind. The [council] pointed out they did not want to keep putting me in hotels, so they put us in Mellors Lodge on November , she said. [The room] was on the first floor, but it was up four flights of stairs and my son pointed outthere was an emergency how would I get down these stairsthe lt was out of order  I cannot guide myself. They had these sensor lights in there and it felt like I was getting flashbanged when they turned on.  It seems like I am being picky. Itaposs not the best scenario but even being on the ground floor with suitable lighting would help. Itaposs just acknowledging that I have a disability. They said they had no choice but to leave the hostel on November  after just four nights, and are now sofa surfing with friends and family. Alan Fallows, , said he has stayed by Ms Lydamore as a friend and now helps care for her and her son. The former construction worker said he was earning around £ to £ per week before he left his job and offered to look after her. Now, he says, he is given just £ each month in carersapos allowance. I have watched a very good friend crumble with her eyesight, he said. Anything that happens to her or Kyden will come back to me so I look after them. I have to do all her medication andKyden needs collecting it comes down to me. She suffers with her eyes on a normal day but these lights were really hurting her. Ms Lydamore added: There is not a lot of help for people like Alan. I thank God that he still wants to help. On Tuesday, December , Ms Lydamore said she finally underwent a risk assessment and hopes to find somewhere that is suitable for someone with a disability.  Mr Fallows said he is hoping that afterwards, things might begin to look up. Nottingham City Council said it has been doing all it can to help, and will continue to support her. A spokesman for Nottingham City Council said: “We’re sorry that Ms Lydamore feels she hasnapost received adequate help and we are very sympathetic to her health needs.

The Prince of Wales is said to have told Andrew there was no way back for him after the Duke of York stepped down from royal duties over his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It came after Prince Philip told his son to take his punishment in a tense meeting a week ago, a new report claims. Andrew, , was summoned to the Queenaposs Sandringham estate in Norfolk to face strong words from Prince Charles on Monday. The showdown came just hours before BBC Panorama aired its interview with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein and alleges she was forced to have sex with the duke on three occasions, including when she was . Andrew has denied her claims in several statements from Buckingham Palace and in a disastrous BBC Newsnight interview last month. In the fallout from that interview, the Queen forced the duke to step back from royal duties as he dragged the Royal Family into the scandal and faced calls to cooperate with an FBI investigation into child sex trafficking allegations against Epstein. On Monday, Andrew was summoned to Sandringham from his home in Windsor to face Charles, , in an apparent move to reinforce the their motheraposs decision, thereported. A source told the newspaper: It was all very civilised but Charles calmly read him the riot act and told him there was no way back for him in the near future. Andrew thought he was being treated harshly as nothing has yet been proved ... but he accepted the decision. He really had little choice.  Another source said: The feeling is that with Prince Philip retired at  and the Queen now , Charles has to take a firm grip on the family and plan for the future. Andrewaposs meeting with Charles came a week after the duke sat down with his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, who has been staying at Sandringham. A source described it as a tense meeting in which Philip told his to take his punishment and step down from royal duties for the sake of the monarchy. In her Panorama interview, Mrs Giuffre,  and now living in Australia, said she was left horried and ashamed after her alleged sexual encounter with Andrew.  There was a bath and it started there and then led into the bedroom, she said. It didnapost last very long, the whole entire procedure. It was disgusting. He wasnapost mean or anything but he got up and he said aposthanksapos and walked out. I sat there in bed, just horried and ashamed and felt dirty. I had to get up and have a shower. She called on the British public to stand up beside her in her fight, saying the duke was the most hideous dancer Iaposve ever seen in my le and his sweat was ... raining basically everywhere at Londonaposs Tramp nightclub in . She said: I was just like grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because thataposs what Jeffrey and Ghislainewould have expected from me.  Mrs Gufre claims she was trafficked by the paedophile financier Epstein and forced to have sex with Andrew when she was a teenager, which the duke categorically denies. The Panorama investigation broadcast on BBC One on Monday night disclosed that five women who allege they were victims of paedophile Epstein are calling on Andrew to give a testimony in their civil court case. They claim the duke saw people being given massages at Epsteinaposs homes. The Queenaposs second son, who stepped down from public duties just over a week ago, insisted in his disastrous Newsnight interview that he did not witness or suspect any suspicious behaviour during his visits to Epsteinaposs homes in Florida, New York and the Caribbean. Panorama claimed it had also uncovered an email allegedly sent by Andrew in  to Ms Maxwell, who is accused of procuring girls for Epstein. She denies the claims and has not been charged with a crime.  In it, the duke is reported to have asked for Ms Maxwellaposs help in dealing with claims by Ms Gufre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts. It was sent at .am on January ,  after Mrs Giuffre lodged court papers in the US. The duke is said to have written: Let me know when we can talk. Got some specic questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts. Ms Maxwell replies: Have some info. Call me when you have a moment. Mrs Gufre alleged how she was brought to London by Epstein in , introduced to Andrew and taken to Tramp nightclub, and asked by the duke to dance.  She told Panorama reporter Darragh Macintyre: He is the most hideous dancer Iaposve ever seen in my le. It was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere, I was just like grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because thataposs what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me. In his recent Newsnight interview, Andrew claimed he had a medical condition in , after suffering an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when he was shot at, which meant he did not sweat. When they had left the club, Mrs Giuffre said the socialite Ms Maxwell, Epsteinaposs then-girlfriend, gave her instructions. In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick, she said. She said that later that evening she had sex with Andrew upstairs at Ms Maxwellaposs house in Belgravia. The duke has denied meeting Ms Giuffre, saying: I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.

A spokeswoman for the Met Office said: There is no indication of snow for next week and weaposre looking at a rather mild and unsettled weekend, with the possibility of rain and strong winds. A weather front will bring blustery showery weather through to Saturday and Sunday and a weather system of low pressure could make things a bit colder, so some signs of frost in Somerset could be possible. However, there is no signal pointing to anything bringing disruption. At most the UK may see light dustings of snow atop high mountains in Scotland or maybe even Exmoor or Dartmoor. However, we are seeing normal temperatures for this time of year.However long range forecasts, for Monday through to December , predicts mountain snow hitting the UK. Unsettled blustery showers are expected to hit on Monday, which could turn wintry over higher ground in the north.The heaviest showers will be seen along North Sea coastal areas, with the northwest staying dry, while it will be rather cold with some patchy frost overnight.Unsettled weather is predicted to persist over the next few weeks,  with showers or longer spells of rain and drier periods being short-lived. Mild temperatures may plummet -  allowing an increasing risk of wintry showers the further north you go - but the mercury may begin to shoot up end of the period "},{"url":null,"title":"mum be 20 polyamorous relationship","story":"NewsMum-to-be, , in a polyamorous relationship will raise baby girl with four dadsTory Ojeda lives with three of her partners in Jacksonville, Florida, and is seven-months pregnant with her first child which will brought up by all her loversShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video polyamorous-woman-who-lives--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news mum-be--polyamorous-relationship-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Tory Ojeda lives with three of her partners in Jacksonville, Florida, and despite being in an open relationship sheaposs the only one who has multiple partners. Seven months ago, Tory found out that she was pregnant with a baby girl who they will welcome into their unconventional family in February. She met one of her partners Marc, , in high school and then got into a relationship with Travis, , two months later. Their love story began three years ago and she has since announced her engagement to Travis in July. Then she also found love in their long-term mutual friend Ethan, , and Christopher, , who is the babyaposs father. She said: “Chris is the biological father. We just know that because of timing and when the approximate conception date was. “Based off of the approximate conception day, we had been on vacation. So it was only us. “But as far as I guess, socially goes, weaposre all raising the baby together, so everyoneaposs dad. “We’re all very, very excited to be raising a baby together.”  Tory says that her boyfriends are “welcome” to pursue other peoplethey wish to - she even encourages the idea. She told Barcroft TV: “Honestly, I would love itsomebody found a second partner. “Dividing time and figuring out schedules between all five people and making sure everyone feels included, it’s kind of dficult. “I’d like to not be the only woman in the relationship. That would definitely be nice.” They all have their own bedrooms but her partners “swap in and out” of her bed each night, making sure each of them gets an “equal turn” in spending the night with Tory.  On the issue of jealousy, Ethan said: “There are a couple of healthy ways to deal with it. Primarily just talking to each other.” She added: “Thereaposs always going to be like little moments of jealousy, it does take a certain amount of restraint and just getting relaxed. I will say it helpsyou know the person.” Reflecting on his own experiences in his current relationship, he said: “Seeing [Tory] with Ethan was a lot easier because I was friends with him. “Her and Chris was a bit dicier at first, there was a lot more jealousy and Iaposll openly admit that. The same goes for Marc because Iaposd never interacted with them.” When asked how he feels about sharing the responsibilities of being a father, Christopher said: “It’s definitely a little interesting.  “I grew up with the idea of you know, one dad, one mum. But there is a lot of support between all of us dads and it’s something we can tag team. “We always joke about the idea of getting stack in an endless loop of go ask your dad.” Despite their enthusiasm to raise a child as a five, some members of their respective families are yet to come around to their relationship and to the pregnancy news.  Tory said: “Most of my friends know all my partners and they love us and think that we’re cute and such. My family is kind of quiet about their disapproval. “Polyamory is definitely an uncommon thing.  “A lot of people have grown up in monogamy culture of, you donapost really love someoneyou have eyes for somebody .” Christopher added: “My family is slowly coming around to the idea. The pregnancy has helped with that. But at the very beginning, I know my mother and father were hesitant about it. “Her main concern was that she didnapost like the idea of me having a partner who was not fulfilled with me alone.” However Ethan’s family are “very active” in their support, along with Tory’s older brother, Alistair. Alistair said: “I will admit that since Iaposm her older brother, that I just have that tendency I suppose to be protective.  “Iaposm more so concerned that sheaposs happy, that she is in a relationship where they both love each other mutually or in this case more people love each other mutually. “I don’t see anything wrong with Tory’s relationship.” After having to overcome judgement in public spaces, Tory hopes that she will eventually see more acceptance of polyamory in wider society. “We definitely get weird looks,” she said. “I’ve had people just say rude comments when weaposve just been hanging out at a fast food place.

Shivam Kumaraposs neighbours believe he is a ine being due to the unusual growth of hairs on his back, so they shower him with chocolates and snacks.They flocked to see him as word spread after he was born in Delhi, India, and some came with flowers believing he was a reincarnation of Hanuman, a powerful monkey deity for Hindus.The growth shocked doctors and Shivamaposs parents, including his mother Reena, , refuse to shave it off because it would bring a bad omen for our family. The incessant visits took place for almost a full year before the familyaposs local guru asked them to stop letting people carry on with worshipping him as a God. The guru said it would have untold effects on his psyche in later le. Since then, the boy has been living his le normally, but continues to be pampered by his neighbours.  His mother said: Everyone loves him so much in my neighbourhood. Initially, it caused a problem for us as people would visit our house every other day which would hinder our daily lives. Our guru suggested asking people to stop this madness and let them live their le, so we followed his instructions and the people now have lessened approaching us although it has not stopped completely.  Sometimes people would come and ask about Shivam but we would deny them by saying he is not in the house. When askedthe doctors have suggested any treatment for Shivam, Reena is adamant there is nothing wrong with my son as he is perfectly healthy.  She added: This is by his birth, we know he is special but we cannot shave the hairs as it would bring a bad omen for our family.

We had managed to stay hopeful and positive for a few hours but it was horrendous and we were on the point of giving up when Gavin saw a light.“To begin with I thought he was seeing things but then I saw it too, although it kept appearing and disappearing.“We barely had any strength left but I just kept blowing desperately on a whistle. The guys on board could hear us but not see us.“They got to us just in time. Gavin was going under.

Eventually I asked to join them,” he said.“The rescue changed my entire le. I left my offshore job and became a fireman in Fe and moved to Broughty Ferry with my family.”Benny has been involved in many shouts himself now.He said: “One I found particularly hard to deal with was an -year-old girl who had fallen from the Tay Bridge. vw, px\"  “She was so young I was really affected.

Doran again was the tormentor-in-chief as he raced down the left but his cross aimed at Jordan White was put behind for a corner by Meekings.It was the Dark Blues# turn to threaten moments later as Jordan McGhee showed good footwork before picking out McGowan at the back post. His shot on the turned was charged down by Brad Mckay before Mark Ridgers comfortably gathered Mackie#s follow-up effort.Five minutes before half-time, Dundee had two glorious opportunities to equalise.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own.

We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

In keeping these candles burning for extended periods, the inidual prayer is believed to be prolonged and amplied along with the intentions of other believers’ prayers.In doing this, a collective spirit of prayer for the entire church is established which is encouraging, enriching and empowering."},{"url":null,"title":"santas helpers wanted to make a happy christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Salvation Army is asking for help from the people of Mid Argyll to bring sackfuls of presents to some of the area#s neediest children and most vulnerable adults.Organisers of the Christmas Present Appeal work with social workers, child workers and community-based care companies to make sure those who would benefit from the appeal get a gt to open on December .The numbers of youngsters and adults needing festive cheer are on the up.When Oban volunteer Morvern Finlayson got involved in the appeal  years ago, there were just  children on the list last year there were , from babies to teenagers, plus  adults.In Mid Argyll new and unwrapped gts can be handed in to the Bank of Scotland in Poltalloch Street, Lochgilphead, from now until Friday December .#We could not do this without the support and generosity of the community who give us gts so thank you to everyone who helps make it possible,# said Morvern.On this year#s wishlist are toys and activities suitable for babies right up to -year-olds, toiletries for teenage girls and boys, hats, gloves, scarves, make-up sets, books, colouring sets and education materials, including pencils, pens and paper.For older people, puzzle books are popular, as are notebooks, soap sets, socks, biscuits, sweets and other goodies.Family games are also high up on the list, said Morvern.Everything needs to be new and unwrapped.

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent. The food van arrived and he packed the chocolate under his jacket.

They currently operate a popular city centre live music venue and have both managed and operated venues in and around the Southside most of their working lives.When asked about their newest venture the owners said: ldquoThis is such an iconic building and an integral part of Shawlandsrsquo history so when it came to choosing a name, it could ever only be The Corona.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"holding-politicians-account-duty-not-bore","story":"Tuesday nightrsquos encounter was not an exact replacement for Kylersquos late and unlamented three ring circus.

To wit: Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland, being held to account and feeling the heat.: Ferry fiasco as Ministers suedEarlier that day, the results of the  Programme for International Student Assessmentsurvey had been published, and they did not make welcome reading for Scotlandrsquos pupils. Scotlandrsquos educational performance, on which the country has always prided itself ndash rightly or wrongly ndash was revealed to be a dangerously leaning tower. Reading levels were up, but performances in maths and science were falling and at record lows. Lindsay Paterson, professor of education policy at Edinburgh University, described Scotlandrsquos overall performance as ldquostagnating in mediocrity.As well as being taken to task on education, the subject on which she has asked to be judged first and foremost, the First Minister was asked about the state of Scotlandrsquos hospitals.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media iFShJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests iFShJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This was not the first time she had been tackled on the subject on television. There was Andrew Neilrsquos now famous question to her on November  in his BBC show.After stating that only two of eight waiting time targets had been hit, Neil went on: ldquoChildren are dying in a new Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated, perhaps by pigeon droppings. A new multi-million pound Edinburgh hospital, should have opened in , is still unfit to open. You canrsquot even get the ventilation system to work. Yoursquove got the worst drug addiction problem in Europe but you cut drug treatment budgets by pound million. You clung on to your last health minister, you are under pressure to sack her successor. Yoursquove called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon : Sturgeon acccuses think-tank on analysisIt was a blistering inquiry. To be fair to Ms Sturgeon, she had responses for both Neil last week and her interrogators on Tuesday. To Neil, she pointed out, among other things, the pound million being put into meeting waiting time targets, the public inquiry into the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and the ldquoextremely high public satisfaction ratings for the NHS in Scotland. In the STV debate she highlighted the improvement in reading.The question here is not how she performed in both instances. She is an impressive politician, on the national and international stage. But why does it take a General Election for her to be challenged so robustly  Why are there not more such encounters For all Andrew Neilrsquos talents, he did not fall out of a magic interviewer tree. He is smart, fast, has a certain dogged style and command of facts and puts them to good use. Similarly, there was nothing radically dferent about the STV debate, other than the participants were allowed to cross examine each other, an innovation all other televised debates should adopt.There is no doubt that the First Minister regularly puts her record forward for scrutiny. She does it every week at FMQs for starters. It should be noted, too, that like the other party leaders, but not Boris Johnson, she went into the Neil den. He has been frit she was not. Over the past few weeks she has appeared in countless debates and phone-ins.Yet as far as television grillings go, it is only in the Neil interview and the STV debate that she has been robustly held to account.Granted, the notion that Scotlandrsquos First Minister is somehow given an easy ride will be laughable to some. Of the near dozen national daily newspapers in Scotland only one, our sister paper The National, openly backs independence and, by implication, the main party supporting it.Of the rest, as any visit to the newsagents will show, no-one would suspect them of being cheerleaders for the FM, and some are ferocious in their criticism.As for the BBC in Scotland, it comes under frequent attack for alleged bias, a charge it denies.This is not solely about the media, however. It is about a political culture that has become too settled and not questioning enough.In part the failure to hold the FM and her Ministers to account can be put down to the calibre of opposition politicians. A fair number, not all, are simply not good enough. Nor is the Scottish Parliament always sitting when problems arise.: Candidate leaflet defacedI do not believe that the First Minister is given an easier time of it because she is a woman. If anything, the opposite is true.The trouble goes wider than any branch of the media, or inidual politician. A few months ago there was a dust up on Twitter between Muriel Gray and Val McDermid. The row flared over a tweet by the BBCrsquos political editor Laura Kuenssberg and whether or not it showed bias against the FM. Ms McDermid said: ldquoI used to respect you @bbclaurak. Insulting a politician for doing their job, however, reduces that respect to shreds.To which Ms Gray replied: ldquoMocking politicians of all and every party instead of beatying them used to be the norm in Scotland. We were rather good at it. The bedrock of Scots humour. Not sure I even recognise this lsquoworship the great leader or rsquo thing. Itrsquos so not ...Scottish. And so it went on.Did Gray have a point  Is there enough distance in Scotland between the government and the governed, or after so long with one party in power has the situation become cosier than is good for us Every government makes mistakes. All governments can do better. There have to be ways of pointing that out that donrsquot meet with accusations of bias or unfairness.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has said there will more recycling vehicles available to carry out collections, as of this week, after a number of recent breakdowns.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While holding the poets aloft, championing them as national talents, it gives them room to breathe and write about whatever they choose.Editor Calum Rodger is Scottish Slam Poetry Champion , and this summer represented Scotland at the Poetry Slam World Cup. The signicant acievement received little media attention here – poets are not always very good at sending out press releases, and it’s a shame they even have to – but it was of little surprise to anyone who knows him. We work together on the co-operatively owned Gutter magazine. For years Rodger has been one of the best live performers on the scene, his words as rigorous as they are joyful. I have seen him coax a teetering, worse-for-wear literary crowd into awed silence by standing on a chair and reciting poetry word perfectly in his North Berwick accent. You can get a taste in a Tedx Talk on Youtube called Glasgow flourishes, where he says “Some would have it thought that Glasgow’s wrought from miracles. They’re wrong. It lives in stone, souls, song and syllables.”: Renfrewshire appoints first Makar: Former staff turn fire on Scottish Poetry Library management in wake of resignation of leading writersIn Rodger’s introduction to Makar Unmakar, small-press Tapsalteerie’s first full collection, he sketches the culture these poems come from. “Poetry is a shared enterprise, through such multarious activities as collaboration, translation, zine and small-press publishing, workshops, events, research, criticism, and pedagogy.” Coverage of what emerges from this petri dish usually concludes poetry is ‘thriving’ pegged on inidual poets or successful spoken-word events. But publishing, occasionally awkwardly, straddles both business and art and that in many ways shapes what emerges.Rhyming Texan lairdsMuch of what happens in collaborative, close-knit small-press scenes is, by nature and by economics, driven more by linguistic passion than by servicing commercial markets as first priority. Funding problems to one side, it’s where some really interesting and innovative writing is nurtured.Scottish art, wherever it is categorised, defined, or boundaried in any way, has always faced a see-saw of self-identity, balanced between thematic and physical claims to ‘Scottishness’. In some instances, definition takes the ‘by formation’ route, akin to the electoral rollyou live here, you’re in. Sometimes, Scottishness is defined more vaguely, fuzzy around the edges but usually with the aim of welcoming, encompassing being born, living, or having studied here, or writing explicitly with reference to Scottish terrain. : Wigtown Prize for Poetry won by Scots language entry for first time: Remembering the Scots poet described as the “worst in the world”‘Makar’, the old Scots word for poet, which has seen a resurgence in recent years with appointments of Edwin Morgan, Liz Lochhead, and Jackie Kay, is playfully balanced with ‘unmakar’. The book is respectful of these poets, but sceptical of the confines of formal roles. As Rodger describes it “Makars-with-a-capital-M who, like their courtly forebears, participate in public discourse from a position of governmental patronage or sponsorship. That contemporary Scotland supports such a role for poetry is a fact worth celebrating, but as with all our democratic institutions it should not be celebrated uncritically. This critical spirit is there in Morgan, Lochhead and Kay, to their great credit.” But, as the introdution continues, the idea of reducing the recognition and support of Scottish poetry to “a civic appelation” is at odds with the wide-ranging interests and inner world of any good poet, no matter where they live.Voices suppressed by poetry establishmentThe reader is reminded that a prior anthology, Twelve Modern Scottish Poets, was entirely male. Although it was published  years ago, there are more recent anthologies which, while marginally better, still skew overwhelmingly towards men, like the Zoo of the New. While the book sets itself up as an alternative, Rodger says the selection wasn’t gender-balanced by numbers. “Rather, it’s simply the case that much of the best poetry in Scotland today is being written by voices hitherto suppressed by the established hierarchies of the poetry world.” This has also played out in recent publishing start-ups who publish more ersely than predecessors because the scene they exist within is more erse. The world turns, slowly.You can feel the academic context Rodger and many of the contributors emerge from most strongly in the introductions to each poet, which attempts to situate them critically alongside the wheres and whats of previous work. As an avid reader, but one who gave up academia years ago, parsing meaning from the dense descriptors occasionally left me ready to shout Parkle. But it’s also a book which says to the reader: make of this what you will. There are no polemics here, no dumbings down.Language ranges from crisp, humourous, or direct in those with a knack for summing up a complex feeling and chasing it around their lines in an attempt to pin it down and others which venture into the unknown, making both the complexity of what’s around and their attempts to grasp it their theme. Juana Adcock, a rising star writer and translator, writes of “a feeling of being at home in the unknown”, Tessa Berringspeaks of “lean words, you know, like spirit, and lightly placed unspeakable things”.Another highlight is Daisy Lafargue who searches for signs in the world around and suggests, “to receive them, it helps to be empty but imbued with residual , like a disused water tower”. Maria Sledmore says “to exist here is ever to quiver”. Elsewhere, Harry Josephine Giles writes future fantasy in Scots and Alice Tarbuck makes mischief with Classical allusions. Their chosen forms y from straightforward to experimental, but each poet has given the reader a ining rod what we find with it depends on what direction we walk, led by our own associations.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

It also leaves the Scottish Parliament with potentially only weeks, instead of months, to scrutinise and debate its own budget.In a statement of intent for the first  days of a Conservative government at Westminster, Boris Johnson said today his top priorities would include a \"Brexit budget\" in February.The Tories claimed a February budget would allow Mr Johnson to deliver on a manesto commitment to cut taxes for working people.: Jo Swinson rules out working with SNPThe Scottish Government had been due to publish its draft budget for   on December . The postponement of the Westminster budget – which had been scheduled for November – had already thrown the status of the Holyrood budget into doubt.Mr Mackay said: “The Tories have a long track record of ignoring the needs of the people of Scotland, but delaying the UK budget until February – just weeks before the new financial year – is nothing short of contempt for Scotland and for devolution.“Having wrecked their own parliamentary processes, they want to damage ours too.“Under the current arrangements, we need a UK budget, before we can set the Scottish budget. Without it we are operating with both hands tied behind our back, making it impossible to plan with any certainty.“Boris Johnson clearly doesn’t understand Scotland, devolution or simple good governance.“If Boris Johnson is able to win a majority next week it will simply add to the economic uncertainty being caused by Brexit that is putting substantial strain on Scotland’s public services. The UK Government was ready to present a budget in early November, so there is no good reason to delay it for two months after the election.”The Fraser of Allander Institutesaid \"one of the ironies of fiscal devolution is that the outlook for the Scottish budget is,anything, more dependent on the outcomes of the UK budget than it was previously\".In a blog post on the issue, published last month, the FAI said: \"The spending decisions of the UK Government effect the Scottish block grant, via the Barnett Formula.\"The Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts of UK income tax revenues also affect the Scottish block grant.\"This is because the size of the deduction made to the Scottish block grantis calculated based on the forecast growth of income tax revenues in the rest of the UK.\"In turn, OBR forecasts of rUK income tax revenues also depend on UK Government tax policy decisions. An increase in rUK income tax rates will affect the Scottish block grant directly .

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense.

It was not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland would be appalled at the latest development.He said: “Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible”.Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “Procurement for the next Northern Isles ferry service contract has been hit by a number of unacceptable delays which does nothing to reassure people in the Northern Isles that the government is committed to improving our leline ferry services.“It is imperative that this dispute is resolved as soon as possible in the best interests of people in Orkney and Shetland.”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston, who lives in Orkney, also weighed in over the situation.He said: “It’s quite incredible that the SNP is being sued by oneits own quangos.“It tells you everything you need to know about the mess the SNP government has made of ferry services that a publicly owned company wants to take it to court, leading to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.“When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents santa with rifle image condemned by the psni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -year-old was the only applicant when the job was advertised and since her first day on September , , she has never looked back. \"I told my friend I had seen the job in the paper and she said to go for it. Back then it was thought of as a job for pensioners but I think it was made for me,\" Isabella said. It was a challenging time as she was the youngest lollipop lady in Northern Ireland and mum to daughters Janet and Amanda. \"Ive never forgotten my first day as my elderly neighbour looked after my youngest girl, who was three at the time, while I was at work,\" she said. \"After a while I wondered what Id let myself in for standing out in the cold.

She added: \"The traffic in the town is unbelievable now, especially in the mornings, and you see all sorts.\"People drinking coffee, eating cereal from a bowl on their knee or women doing their make-up. Ive seen it all. Drivers can ignore me and nearly run into me at times so I have jumped on to the footpath.

Melanie Houston, principal of Fivemiletown Primary School, insisted Isabella is a valued member of the school community. \"Isabella is always where she should be to make sure the children and any accompanying parents are safely escorted across the road,\" she said. \"I have never heard her complaining about the weather no matter how cold or wet. \"She is a friendly and familiar face and as much a part of our staff as any teacher, classroom assistant, caretaker or kitchen staff member.\" While this year has been eventful for Isabella,  will be just as signicant as she will celebrate  years of marriage to her husband Victor .

These are Tory-held marginal seats that would fall to Labour on a swing of less than %, putting them near the top of the party’s nationwide list of targets.If Labour manages to do particularly well in the region, the seats of Watford and Stevenage might also be in play, although the swings needed here are larger .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour is also on the defensive in a number of constituencies in Eastern England. It is here that the electoral map of the region might stand more of a chance of changing colour – and in each case it will be from red to blue.Ipswich, Bedford and Peterborough represent a trio of urban seats currently held by Labour but which could all slip from the party’s hands on December the Conservatives have performed well at the polls.Ipswich and Bedford need tiny swings to switch from Labour to the Conservatives , while in Peterborough the Tories will be hoping to jump from third place, where they finished in the by-election earlier this year, up to first.There is the potential for another Tory gain in Eastern England in the shape of Norfolk North, held by the Liberal Democrats since . Long-serving Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb is standing down at this election, making the seat potentially more vulnerable to a swing to Conservatives.Finally, there is the constituency of Hertfordshire South West, where former Tory cabinet minister David Gauke is trying to hold his seat – but this time as an Independent rather than a Conservative. Mr Gauke split from his party earlier this year over disagreements concerning Boris Johnson’s Brexit policy. He faces a tough challenge to retain his seat, not least because the Conservatives are running a candidate against him."},{"url":null,"title":"man makes mashterpiece model of tesla with thanksgiving mashed potatoes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright.

She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead.

Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
