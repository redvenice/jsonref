[{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markles organic baby shawl used swaddle Archie workers earning 37 PENCE hour","story":"Share this article   Mrs Regar, who is affectionately known as Aruna Devi amongst her colleagues and friends, said: \u0027You can see how we live. It is a basic existence. We work all the hours that God sends because we have to.\u0027We do not understand things about saving the planet or what is or is not organic. For us it is all about work and survival.\u0027         Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong KongMrs Regar\u0027s husband Ram Gopal also works at Nayika where his duties include cutting the organic cotton for the blanket Archie was wrapped in. As a master cloth cutter, he earns more than his wife, taking home around 15,000 rupees per month (£176).The couple start work at 9.30am and finish at 5.30pm, six days per week. They are only given 25 minutes for lunch and are not provided with any formal contracts.Their salaries may seem low by western standards but in Mr Gopal\u0027s case, he earns above the national average monthly salary of 13,000 rupees (£154). His wife however falls below this threshold meaning their combined income is barely enough for a family of eight. Neither of their sons are in full-time employment and have just started their own hand printing business from home. The family survives on a mainly vegetarian diet of rice, lentils and vegetables, which have increased in price in recent times. A kilo of lentils, for example, can cost anything up to 200 rupees (£2.37) while most vegetables are less than half that. The average price of a bottle of beer is also 200 rupees.Mr Gopal, aged 55, said: \u0027Even though by Indian standards my salary is just above average as a family, if you combine our income, we are poor and things are very hard. We do not know about the world of the rich and famous who buy the things we make. We do not even know which countries it is being sent to. \u0027My job is very demanding and requires a lot of skill but it is not very well paid. Sadly, it is all I know, this is the only thing that I\u0027ve done all my life.\u0027When shown a picture of Meghan holding baby Archie in the blanket he helped make, Mr Gopal beamed with pride. He added: \u0027I do not know who these people are but we had heard that somebody very famous was using our dohar. This must be them.              Businesswoman Harjani-Hardasani (left) posted this photo of her with one of her Indian workers Aruna Regar, 55 (right) who she called \u0027inspirational\u0027 to celebrate International Women\u0027s Day       Mrs Regar (above) lives in this decrepit house on the outskirts of Bagru. She shares it with her husband, two sons, their wives and two grandchildren. They live in two rooms, which are poorly lit due to intermittent electricity while there is also a limited water supply. A hole in the ground passes for a toilet while the bathroom is composed of a bucket and tap       Mrs Regar\u0027s husband Ram Gopal (pictured together) also works at Nayika where his duties include cutting the organic cotton for the blanket Archie was wrapped in. As a master cloth cutter, he earns more than his wife, taking home around 15,000 rupees per month (£176)         Mrs Regar, a seamstress, helping add finishing touches to what they have dubbed \u0027the Royal blanket\u0027 produced pay slips showing she earns an average of 6,000 rupees per month (above)\u0027Perhaps they might want to come and visit me one day to see how I made it? I might be poor but I feel very proud that royal people are using this blanket.\u0027When MailOnline visited the Nayika factory, workers were busy hand block printing reams of organic cotton which form the outer layers of the dohar. These are then stuffed with mulmul, fine, soft cotton and then stitched to complete the blanket. Since Meghan appeared in public with Archie wrapped in it, orders have gone through the roof and around 2,000 are currently being made to meet demand. The hand-crafted blanket has sold out on the Malabar Baby website and is available for pre-order only. It is described as being \u0027simple but chic,\u0027 and makes \u0027cuddle time lots of fun at home or on the go.\u0027Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry. Workers are paid a fixed monthly salary, as opposed to each item they make, child labour is strictly forbidden and there is a high level of cleanliness. While concerns have been raised over salaries, employees describe the management as \u0027fair.\u0027         Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry.

We make all the Malabar Baby range and ensure that this is done to a very high standard.\u0027We were very shocked to learn of the royal approval for our product. We told all the workers about it but I don\u0027t think they really understood the significance of this. But we are delighted that the Royal family of Great Britain are using something that we have made. It is a true honour.\u0027When asked about the meagre wages of some of the workers, Mr Mohammed replied: \u0027These are industry standard rates. We do not set them.\u0027Our workers enjoy good conditions, much better than you\u0027ll find at other factories. We pay them the correct rate and treat them well.\u0027Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American businesswoman Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong Kong. She came up with the idea after being unable to find baby wear and accessories that she felt were affordable and of high quality.She named the company after the exclusive area of Mumbai where he family lives.During a visit to the Nayika factor earlier this year, Anjali posted a photograph of herself with Mrs Regar on social media to celebrate International Women\u0027s Day but incorrectly called her Anita.  A spokeswoman for the company told MailOnline: \u0027Malabar Baby is a small, family run business that prides itself on producing high quality products which are slow made in small batches. \u0027The dohar blanket takes between 5 - 7 days to make and requires the work of highly skilled block printers to produce. The founder is passionate about encouraging people to buy less and buy better quality, but offering products at an accessible price point so they can be enjoyed by all,\u0027 they added. "},{"url":null,"title":"Boeing Boeing gone","story":"               As the person filming places the roll within the opening, the second they press the flush button it disappears in nearly the blink of an eyeThe paper is devoured with such force that the cardboard roll is left spinning on its holder following the seconds-long disappearing act.  The incident was filmed on July 5 this year. The Boeing 737 was envisioned in 1964, with the first flights taking off three years later. Various alterations of the aircraft were introduced in the following decades.               The paper is devoured with such force that the cardboard roll is left spinning on its holder following the seconds-long disappearing act"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry interviewed Dr Jane Goodall Meghans edition British Vogue","story":"Share this articleEmulate the Duchess of Sussex in a chic jumpsuit by EverlaneShop it hereThe Duchess of Sussex is guest-editing the September issue of Vogue and it\u0026#39s safe to say we\u0026#39re rather excited about it!In a behind-the-scenes shot, Meghan looked her usual chic self in a jumpsuit by Everlane.

One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think it was a sign of acceptance’I was in my mid-20s when Cornell Capa, director of the International Center of Photography in New York, recommended me for a job documenting life in the American sector of Berlin while the city was still ided. As a young photographer, I was so nervous. All of these senior German officials were swanning around my studio inspecting my work.I blurted out that I wasn’t American, that I was born in Canada, almost like a confession. I felt I had to tell them. They just looked at me quizzically, laughed and started speaking in German. I have no idea what they thought of me. But I got the job.In the west, I discovered a different side to the disorder. Every Saturday, punks would hang out, drink beer and blare music through their soundsystems. Cars would be set alight and bank windows smashed in. The cops would arrive, teargas them and send them running to find shelter in nearby bars, and the whole cycle would repeat. They were sceptical of me to begin with. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think that was a sign of acceptance.Getting to know them wasn’t easy, and it happened in the strangest of ways. I would carry a bunch of bananas to snack on while I wandered the streets. When I found the punks, I didn’t know what to say, so I offered them bananas. They just laughed at me. But they must have liked it, because they welcomed me into their crew.As I got to know them, I realised they fitted into the idea of the “wall sickness”, but they were the manic side of the depression that reigned in the east. There was something psychotic about punk at the time. These weren’t just weekend punks and “punk” wasn’t just a look – this was their life.The woman in this shot was called Miriam, and the rat on her shoulder is called Bestia. It was a week or so before Reagan was planning to visit, and there were windows smashed all over the city in protest. Despite the violence and the militancy, she was extremely gentle. She was big, much bigger than me, but she had a soft way of gesturing and moving.She invited me to her place, a nearby squat. We hung out, drank tea, took some shots and became friends. She introduced me to her rat, Bestia, who lived in her oven. Being a squat, it had no electricity, so it was perfectly safe. Bestia was almost like a  angel for Miriam, keeping her safe amid the anarchy. I think it was useful to keep guys off her back, too – nobody’s messing when you have a rat draped around your neck.People feel this image represents a moment in Berlin’s history, or the punk movement more broadly, but to me it’s a shot of someone I got to know, who welcomed me into a hard-to-reach scene. It was a doorway for me into other activist and protest scenes, and I remember the time fondly.People seem to think that punk has died, and maybe elements of the aesthetic have. But the spirit of punk was so much more than a look, and I think that lives on, albeit in different forms. I think we saw it in the Occupy movement, within elements of the Arab spring, and I think we are seeing it today in the UK with Extinction Rebellion.Training: Film and television production, New York University.Influences: Diane Arbus, Brassaï, the Capa brothers, Eikoh Hosoe, André Kertész, Dorothea Lange, Helen Levitt, Mary Ellen Mark, László Moholy-Nagy, Gordon Parks, Thomas Ruff, Aaron Siskind, Francesca Woodman.Low point: “A life-changing accident on a film set in 1979.”Top tip: “Draw with your eyes.

The pilots’ union, Balpa, can now proceed with planned strikes over pay, as long as it gives two weeks’ notice. The airline carries up to 145,000 passengers a day.Talks between the union and BA aimed at reaching a compromise restarted on Wednesday afternoon and could continue until Friday.“BA’s attempt to defeat the democratic view of their pilots in court, rather than deal with us across the negotiating table, has sadly wasted huge amounts of time and money that could have been put into finding a peaceful resolution,” Balpa’s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said.“While no strike dates have yet been issued by Balpa, and they are required to give us 14 days’ notice of any intention to call strike action, we ask our customers to review their contact details by visiting ba, or by contacting their travel agent. We continue to pursue every avenue to find a solution to avoid industrial action and protect our customers’ travel plans.Ninety-three per cent of BA’s 4,000 pilots voted to take industrial action after rejecting a three-year pay deal. Balpa said it would not announce strike dates until it had held further talks with BA.Pilots seek an above-inflation pay settlement that would also include a profit-share scheme, reflecting their argument that they took pay cuts when BA was struggling as a result of the financial crisis and that they should share in the benefit now the business has recovered. BA provided the largest share of its parent company IAG’s €2.9bn (£2.6bn) pre-tax profit in 2018.Separately, planned strikes by thousands of airport workers could disrupt flights at Heathrow, BA’s main base, with a series of walkouts starting on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a352dabc3a71b67fab4354bc76b28f06e85fcda8/0_236_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abbf2088247b9e606be60572394d7b5","title":"next bucks high street trend with better than expected sales","story":"Next has shrugged off a damp start to the summer with better than expected sales at its high-street stores.“We weren’t expecting this quarter to be as good as it has been,” said Simon Wolfson, the Next chief executive. “Partly we may have overestimated the benefit we had last year from the good weather.”The good performance comes despite widespread troubles on the high street which have led to a string of retailers, including Debenhams, Topshop and New Look, closing stores and asking landlords for rent cuts.Sofie Willmott, an analyst at GlobalData, a market analysis firm, said: “Next’s current performance is not an indicator for its mid-market competitors as the retailer continues to outperform.”She said Next’s click-and-collect services and efforts to reinvent its stores by adding a range of concessions from coffee shops to car dealers had helped attract shoppers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety.

Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days.

Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff.

She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs.

Here’s how it wentLast week, as Paris faced down its hottest day since records began, the city authorities declared their readiness. Since the notorious heatwave of 2003 that killed thousands across France, the capital has put in place a heat strategy: cooling areas, a checking system for vulnerable people, shady parks kept open all night.Could these strategies actually work against a predicted record temperature of 42C (107.6F)? A study released this week shows that the world has never warmed faster than now. By 2050, the average temperature in the hottest month in Paris will rise by six degrees. This heatwave might be the new normal.Now that the heat has eased across Europe, it seems like time for some cool reflection on how effective the official advice actually was. Here’s what happened when I followed it.Temperature outside: 29CStrategy: shutter your house, spend three hours at low temperatureI wake in a sweat, having managed some fitful sleep with the help of a fan during one of the hottest nights in Paris history. Now it’s time to try to keep my tiny, 100-year-old house as cool as possible. Following the advice of the health department, I close all the shutters. Then I take my fluffy dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws. It’s pretty hot outside now, but nothing out of the ordinary: I’m mostly cranky and tired from the high temperatures overnight.Back home, the dog gets a big bowl of cold water, and I get ready for my day. According to the Paris heatwave plan, I have a plan to spend three hours at low temperatures to avoid adverse health consequences, and I’m prepared with other recommendations of the French health department: I’ve made a personal extreme-heat pack with a spray bottle to mist myself with water, a handheld thermometer and a large bottle of water. I’m ready.Temperature outside: 34CStrategy: spend time in air conditioningThe temperature outside my front door has improbably climbed by five degrees in the last hour alone. The city is already uncomfortable: the narrow pavements and heavy traffic make it feel even hotter than 34C. There’s nowhere to hide from the exhaust fumes and the already fierce sun.The official advice is to find air conditioning, so I walk to a nearby hotel. I’m already sweating when I arrive, but as soon as I step into reception my body temperature plunges uncomfortably. I’m also supposed to “eat in sufficient quantities”, which I’m interpreting to mean a buffet spread designed for hungry tourists and involving a lot of cheese. I look around at all the guests. They all passed a blissful night sleeping in 18C. They look refreshed, at ease, unflustered. One woman is wearing a scarf. I hate them.Temperature: 38CStrategy: use the Extrema app to seek out ‘cool islands’ avoid too much walkingIf 34C was uncomfortable, 38C is nasty. As the heat rises from the bitumen, I fire up the city’s dedicated heatwave app, Extrema, which identifies 922 “islands of cool”. The first place it recommends is a library: presumably air-conditioned, unfortunately closed. The next suggestion is a nearby church, the Église Saint-Germain-de-Charonne, which is deliciously cool – but a small mass is being held, and I feel like an intruder, so I pop out to the adjoining cemetery. Here, the heat radiates off the polished gravestones in waves: it’s worse than the street. I drink from a fountain, but the water comes out piping hot. I had heard there was a water mister nearby, so I set out to find it, but fail. Extrema confirms it was only installed for two days.Tramping around has driven my body temperature straight back up. The health department’s advice is to avoid physical exertion, such as walking long distances. I take the bus to a park.Temperature: 41CStrategy: use a heat map to find green spacesI’ve made a huge mistake. The bus is stifling, airless. My handheld thermometer has maxed out at 43C. I see pedestrians in the burning sunlight and I am jealous of them.Collapsing out at the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, I expect some relief, but temperatures outside have now officially broken the previous record, from 1947, of 40.4C. The Buttes-Chaumont is one of the city’s largest parks, with waterfalls, sloping lawns and shady grottoes. Since 2015, it has been open 24 hours a day in summer. Over half of it is covered with more than 100 enormous old trees, making it one of the coolest places in Paris, according to the heat map. But 41C is 41C. There’s an eerie hush as small family groups and the odd shirtless or bikini-clad inidual take refuge in the shade.Temperature: 42CStrategy: use town hall ‘refreshment rooms’ check in on loved onesAfter the 2003 heatwave, Paris set up the Chalex service, which allows vulnerable people to receive telephone check-ups during extreme heat. The worst sufferers can be brought to a refreshment room at their local town hall. In the 19th arrondissement, that’s an air-conditioned meeting room: it’s cool enough inside, but the portable air-conditioner is beginning to struggle against 42C.Emerging again into the blasting heat, I follow another of the health department’s rules: check in on your loved ones. In my case, that means texting my partner to ask how the dog is doing. The dog is lying in front of a fan, his fur gently ruffling. The dog is doing much better than me. I’m still radiating heat, primarily it seems from my face. But I’m also lucky that my loved ones are a young man and a resilient street dog. Elderly relatives, or people with reduced mobility who can’t necessarily make it to cooler spaces on their own, need human connection even more urgently in heat crises.Temperature: 42CAdvice: help the vulnerableIn any city, heatwaves are hardest for those who lack shelter. For the hottest part of the day, I join a walking group of city officials and volunteers seeking out women who are living on the streets. The group provides hygiene kits and offers to take the women to cooler spaces. Leading the charge is Dominique Versini, one of the city’s deputy mayors.Versini says the heatwave presents serious problems for all homeless people, but particularly women, who are “in twice as much danger”. Exposed to high levels of violence on the streets and often dealing with trauma, she says, many are afraid to access services such as refreshment rooms and public baths where they could cool off.The temperature hits its all-time maximum: 42.6C. The 18th is one of the densest parts of the city, and the photographer and I are struggling. My body is burning up, and now my anxiety is also rising sharply. I know this heatwave has almost certainly been caused by the human-created climate crisis. Greenhouse emissions are on track to reach a record high. I know I will live, best case, to see these problems get much worse. I feel a kind of existential dread. My muscles are starting to get sore.We duck into a supermarket and I end up caressing my face with a range of chilled goods. Orange juice is pretty good but a glass jar of foie gras works best.Temperature: 42.6CAdvice: swim in the canalOn a normal day, I harbour no desire to jump into the Bassin de la Villette. I have seen the bikes, shopping trolleys and electric scooters being fished out of there, coated in muck. There are rumours of a crocodile.But the outdoor pool alongside it, which is full of filtered canal water, has been in use since 2017 as part of a plan by the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to make public waterways such as the Seine swimmable in time for the 2024 Olympics. Anyway, at this stage I would happily leap into a Siberian toxic dump-lake if I thought it would cool me down.Unfortunately there’s a monstrous queue to get in, leaving would-be bathers baking along the pavement. Some have given up and are ing into the open canal. Everyone seems fine with this.I eventually make it to the pool, and lower myself with a sound I didn’t know I was capable of: something between a whimper of fear and a groan of satisfaction. The water is a toasty 25.5C, and oddly slimy, but swimming feels incredible. I’m smiling for the first time in more than 24 hours. I try to avoid thinking about how much canal water I’m ingesting, and that E coli scare from a couple of years ago.Temperature: 41CAdvice: douse yourself in cold waterThe effects of the pool wear off more or less as soon as I get out of the water and cross a bridge over the canal in full sun. On the other side, Paris Plage – a sandless beach along the banks of the canal and the Seine, set out with deckchairs, bars and summer games – is a muted affair, with most activities shut down because of the heat. A few people languidly dangle their feet in the water.But at the end of the canal, sweet relief. The city authorities have set up a temporary fountain that spouts water out of the top, not just from the taps below. I drench myself through. This is proper cold water, some of the first I’ve encountered today. It is extremely refreshing. I happily drip home on the metro.I am too traumatised to cook without air conditioning, so I head back to the same restaurant. The good news is that between breakfast, dinner and the refreshment room today, I have accumulated my required three hours at low temperatures. The bad news is the health department says I shouldn’t drink alcohol during a heatwave, and I could really use a beer.Rules are rules, so I stick with a carafe of water. It proves to be a bad choice: a beer would have at least been cold, while this tap water is somehow hotter than room temperature. I was starving but I can now only manage half of my meal, so I wander home to flop on the couch. It’s hot in my living room, but the shutters seem to have fended off the worst.Temperature: 33CAdvice: go to a 24-hour parkAt midnight, it still hasn’t cooled down enough to sleep. At a mere 33C outside I reckon it’s fine to walk the dog, so off we go towards the Square Sergent Aurélie Salel, one of 13 parks open all night in summer. We pass half an hour there, with a clutch of other overheated young Parisians who are smoking half-heartedly beneath a tree, before turning back home. Jammed between two fans, I grab what sleep I can, but I don’t fully relax until 11am the next day when a thunderstorm breaks the spell.I’m also acutely aware that I’m healthy and have some freedom and control over my movements. Many Parisians don’t: they have to move around the city according to their daily schedules, no matter the temperature. Some have no choice but to be outside all day during a heatwave. With its apps, cool spots and check-in services, the City of Paris is doing a lot to help them, but if my day taught me anything it’s that reality seems to be catching up with what research has long been telling us. The effects of rapid climate change are already here – and we are not ready.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd38146685dc53b8a5a158d1cca8c6fa1b80dcd4/0_215_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b6cda0d0ba925d720f4c3cbc3815509","title":"is this fascism no could it become fascism yes","story":"Trump’s persistent hold on his base shows the power to be had in reinventing anti-American values as patrioticAmid the global rise of rightwing populism, “fascist” has become a common – indeed over-used – epithet. The F-word is convenient for critics of the new wave of populism, seeking as it does to tie their opponents to historical movements which nearly all of mainstream society regards as deplorable. But the word is convenient for the right too, allowing them to wave away their critics as overwrought and deranged while avoiding serious discussion of the substance of their policies and rhetoric.Even the Trumpified Republican party is not a fascist movement and Trump is certainly no Hitler. Full-blown fascism usually emerges under the pressure of economic collapse or existential war, but it is constructed from pre-existing social and political raw materials. But while the Trump era hasn’t seen the rise of a true fascism in the United States, it has given us sharp and painful insights into the raw materials out of which a future American fascism might be constructed.Any fascism of the future will be different from that of the 20th century. But it will have to share features with its forebears, including ultranationalism, illiberalism, a strong impulse to regiment society, and the forcible suppression of opposition. This fascism would, in other words, cut against what most Americans still recognize – even if only to give lip service to – as the core values of their nation.Yet Trump’s persistent hold on his base shows how a coalition against characteristically American values may be constructed and used to hold power, even if the coalition represents only a minority of the country. In particular, Trump appeals to two overlapping groups – white evangelicals and white voters motivated primarily by opposition to racial and cultural change – who each have their own reasons to embrace illiberalism and endorse the power of an illiberal state being used against their enemies.What these groups share is a belief that their very existence is threatened. Evangelical Christian support for Trump is often motivated by the fear that secular liberals are seeking to crush Christianity and banish it from the land. Such a fear lends itself to support for an authoritarian who will crush the opposition before it gets a chance to strike first. Trump has shown that evangelicals will support anyone who even pretends to care about their motivating issues – abortion, Jerusalem, religious freedom – regardless of his obvious repugnance by any normal understanding of Christian values.This ideology’s beating heart will be a white nationalism motivated by a belief that the “true” (read: white) America is under siege from a combination of racial minorities and liberal elites. This conspiratorial worldview likewise lends itself to a support for using state power against these enemies of the people. For the future, the fact that Trump has generally been rather incompetent and unfocused at dismantling liberal democratic norms and institutions is less important than the fact that so many of his rank-and-file supporters clearly relish the idea that he might.Some conservative thinkers have begun to lay the intellectual groundwork for the dismantling of liberalism in order to save values they consider more important, be these the defense of their version of Christian values or the defense of white cultural and political power. Among the more extreme is the Catholic writer Sorab Ahmari, who recently argued that liberalism is no longer compatible with Christianity and that the public square should be reorganized in pursuit of “the Highest Good”. Many other conservative writers are all too willing to excuse Trump’s illiberalism and racism by arguing that Trump’s enemies represent a much greater threat to their values than he does.The scribblings of such writers are less important for the ideas they contain than for their realization that we live in a moment in which it has become possible to imagine an illiberal America, and their flirtation with the forces which might take us there. Illiberal intellectuals are starting to see the Trump movement as a force to be harnessed in pursuit of undemocratic ends. We don’t yet know the limit of what those chanting people at Trump rallies who say they want to lock people up and send them away would tolerate in practice. But we should be afraid to find out.An American fascism would not only marry Christianity and ultranationalism through a shared belief in conspiracies aiming to destroy America, but it would also seek to retain the support of capital. Trump has demonstrated how to combine regressive economic policies with a populist image by attacking minorities and elites. Anyone promoting progressive economic reform is dismissed as a communist and hence as un-American – another one of the conspirators, and another reason to line up behind a strongman who will keep them out of power. This is why “the Squad”, who in the worldview of the right are both communists and America-hating brown people, are the perfect foil.These are the raw materials out of which a future American fascism might be built. Such an eventuality is not only uncertain, but positively unlikely, especially in the absence of economic disaster, major war, or a devastating terrorist attack. But it is no longer unimaginable, and it will become even less so if white, Christian America continues to react to its loss of power in the same way. For this reason, the word fascist deserves its place in the political vocabulary of our time, not as a description of the present, but as a foreboding of one possible dark future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e0ad79820be7bbc2b196480771e844dcc8315a/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a88bf21ba2de3b2ce8a6d569870a105","title":"i was only going to give up alcohol for a month but i wasnt prepared for the impact it had","story":"I drank to pretend my life was more interesting. Feeling slow or a little sad in the mornings was so normal I barely noticed itNow what? I have given up alcohol for a month. That’s nothing special. Thousands of people do Dry July or Feb Fast or some random month. But it is a big thing. I hadn’t had 30 days off alcohol my entire adult life.The reason I thought it was a good idea isn’t unique either. It’s boringly familiar. I’m middle aged and, after drinking modestly for decades, it had crept up. One glass of wine a night became two, and then three and – no point in skirting around the facts here – too often it was a bottle, sometimes more. Occasionally, if I was particularly anxious, I’d buy a bottle of wine during the day and drink the lot.There’s shame in even writing that, but it’s true. Over the past few years, my husband and I had countless discussions and a few raging arguments about cutting back alcohol, and we tried the obligatory “alcohol-free nights”. But in the jargon of the online crowd experimenting with the previously unthinkable, I was “sober curious”.One of my main worries was what on earth I would do in the evenings. Drinking was what I “did” – preferably alone in my head or watching some Netflix show or offering random opinions on Twitter.Feeling slow or a little sad in the mornings was so normal I barely noticed it. Work was interesting but I lacked ambition. I avoided people, not especially enjoying everyday things like going for a walk, or a seeing a movie, or meeting friends for lunch. It took me a few years to grasp it, but alcohol was controlling my life to an extent that I found it hard to hide, even to myself. I had watched my father commit the slow suicide of the middle class, slumped drunk in front of the television. I had contempt for him at the time, and I was becoming him.Every person is different. Jill Stark was a young single woman when she wrote High Sobriety, and her tussle with alcohol was about social binge drinking. Peter FitzSimons wanted to lose weight and shape up and I envied his blokey pragmatism – “stop being a piss-head” seemed as good advice as any. I have friends with demanding jobs raising young children alone and they really, really feel like a drink after all-day playdates.I often quoted Hemingway: “I drink to make other people more interesting.” But it wasn’t true. I drank to pretend that my life was more interesting than it was, to escape from everyday problems, and because I enjoyed it. Or maybe that’s self-justifying crap. Maybe it’s just that alcohol is an addictive substance like all of those illicit drugs we demonise and, over the years, I had become addicted.So, now what? The problem with giving up alcohol for a month is that it’s ridiculously, unexpectedly good. I had entirely novel experiences. Like meeting friends for a drink before the theatre and not drinking. Like not drinking on a Friday night. Like going to a family lunch and sipping mineral water. Like going to a book launch and standing around for an hour without drinking the warm, cheap white wine.The month wasn’t entirely alcohol free. I drank one night, on Monday 15 July. It was the day my healthy, vibrant, full-of-life mother, out of the blue, was diagnosed with a very serious illness. My first thought was automatic – “I need a drink” – and I drank a bottle of red wine, feeling overwhelmed by sadness, trawling through the internet to read up on the disease, and expecting the worst about how my family would emotionally cope.But what happened the next day was, for me, astonishing. I had a slightly hungover thought: “Drinking won’t help. It won’t help me, and it won’t help Mum. Drinking will make things worse.” I had never had such a thought in my life.There is a sense of achievement in doing something you weren’t quite sure you could do, even something relatively modest as giving up booze for a month. But I wasn’t expecting the scale and scope of its impact. After two weeks or so, I posted on my Facebook page: “Have discovered (a bit of a surprise to be honest), am a better, kinder, more present, more energetic, more productive, happier person when I don’t drink. What a bummer!”I was only going to give up for one month but these things were hard to dismiss. I was more mentally available for friends and family, a better listener, less swift to judge. I was more productive, and the stir of ambition returned. I ate better, exercised more. I slept like a baby, no longer waking up feeling foggy. I was a happier person.As an over-researcher, I read countless articles and several books. Alcohol is a toxic, addictive substance that our body works hard to expel. That’s it. I’m not preaching but it’s the truth and we all kind of know it. It’s so ubiquitous, so glamorised in popular culture, so cleverly advertised, we’re in communal denial, although that seems to be slowly changing.It’s difficult to argue with the largest and most detailed research into the global impact of alcohol, which found that the idea that “moderate drinking” was harmless or even beneficial was a myth (one that the alcohol industry promotes relentlessly). The more you drink, the worse the risks, but even occasional drinking is bad for you.Alcohol causes several forms of cancer and increases your risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Its role in violence is undeniable. In Australia, it causes more harm than any other drug. The evidence is there, but still, what a bummer. If I’m honest, what I missed most is that feeling 30 minutes or so after the first drink. The feeling of bliss, when problems float away. I was indeed invincible, witty, about to do brilliant things any moment now. Short-lived, un-ironic, self-aggrandisement.Could that feeling, however brief, whatever the price, be worth it? Part of me still thinks yes. Surely I can reduce drinking and still get to feel that euphoria, that numbing of incessant thoughts, that fading of inhibition.But after one month, the benefits of sobriety outweighed the benefits of alcohol, no matter how hard I tried to spin it. While my husband looks forward to Alcohol August, I am thinking of going another month without booze. I can’t say I won’t drink again – the thought is terrifying – but the ledger leans too far one way to be ignored.Cheers to that.• Comments on this piece will be premoderated"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed87f3b546c2dfca9771655cd48f757c3b9316b8/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07bf1b094f442967586ef4f37b32d83d","title":"leo varadkar media telegraph sun irish taoiseach brexit","story":"Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, is being demonised by the Brexit-supporting section of the British press. His determination to stick by the backstop provision in the EU withdrawal agreement has particularly outraged the Daily  and the Sun.Both papers, with tacit support from the , are engaged in a tactic familiar to those who, down the years, witnessed the treatment that has been handed out to homegrown politicians such as Tony Benn, Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock and, of course, Jeremy Corbyn.Varadkar is being groomed as the Brexit bogeyman, not least because, with the changing of the guard in Brussels, he is currently the most identifiable inidual defending the European Union’s position.In order to ram home their propaganda, the papers have blamed him for the likelihood of Britain crashing out of the EU. A Sun editorial claimed that Varadkar would be responsible for “the potential chaos of a no-deal Brexit”.It even dared to refer to him witheringly as “Ireland’s rookie PM”, which is a bit rich given that Varadkar has been in office for more than two years while the Sun’s great hero, Boris Johnson, has been in No 10 for barely a week.For historical humbug, however, it is difficult to better the accusation by the Sunday ’s columnist, Simon Heffer, that Varadkar is guilty of being “wrong to disregard the ancient ties between Britain and Ireland”. Does he not understand that it is the continuation of those ties, through Britain’s retention of six Irish counties, that is the very reason for the problem?Heffer’s bizarre belief is that Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney, want “to be weaponised by Brussels in the EU’s determination to force a no-deal Brexit”. Given that such a scenario would be crippling to Ireland’s economy, that is a ludicrous claim.The following day, the ’s commentator, Nick Timothy (and former chief of staff to ex-prime minister Theresa May), also turned reality on its head by accusing Varadkar of being “the real threat to peace”. He contended that the taoiseach’s “hardline stance on the backstop risks bringing back a hard border and destabilising the Good Friday agreement”. Not content with that, he then argued that Varadkar “doesn’t understand the Good Friday agreement”.So, Varadkar is being scapegoated as the villain of the piece, but also the villain of the peace. Then again, the ’s criticism of Varadkar goes back at least a year. In July 2018, one of its commentators, Tom Harris, called Varadkar “ill-informed and arrogant” and “not up to the task when it comes to Brexit”.Another of its commentators, Ruth Dudley Edwards, wrote in January of Varadkar being “naive” and of suddenly realising, supposedly, that Ireland was being “used to punish Britain”. No proof, of course, just a wrong-headed opinion based on an intense dislike for the Irish government’s reliance on the backstop as the best way to avoid a hard border.But this did not take account of the fact that Varadkar’s overall poll ratings have been in decline for some time, and that this is not related to Brexit. It should not be taken to indicate a lack of popular support for his line on the backstop. Just the reverse. It is possible to argue that Varadkar’s poll numbers would be lower still without his steadfast backing for the withdrawal agreement. Indeed, British media antagonism may well improve Varadkar’s status.Several papers sought to represent Tuesday’s phone conversation between Johnson and Varadkar as a “clash”, although all the evidence from both sides suggests both men, without rancour, simply restated their opposing views on the backstop. Over a photo of Johnson clutching a chicken during his visit to a Welsh poultry farm, the Sun carried the headline: “For cluck’s sake, Leo, give us an eggsit.”Seen in the context of the paper’s previous attacks on Varadkar, the thinly veiled message of the childish pun was that it is not only open season on Ireland’s prime minister but, perhaps, on Ireland itself.Needless to say, the Irish edition of the Sun was altogether more sympathetic towards the taoiseach, featuring a picture of Varadkar with a bubble caption aimed at Johnson and containing a very different pun: “Stop choking the chicken and let’s do a deal already.”• Roy Greenslade is professor of journalism at City University and a  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e8ca7f3d5197533c343a842a03af634ba2c7376/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bc4087853cc357fadecb067f77b2d67","title":"mail on sunday marriage child maria walsh adrian chiles","story":"Admittedly, I am getting forgetful – but I don’t think the wife and child the Mail on Sunday reported on just slipped my mindIt has been a while since I’ve had the dreaded Saturday afternoon call from a Sunday newspaper. It only ever happens because they are planning to run something you would rather they weren’t. This weekend it concerned a rumour the Mail on Sunday had heard about me supposedly dating someone. My blood temperature dropped I hate this stuff. My romantic life is no one’s business I can’t believe anyone’s interested anyway and it’s just generally mortifying. That said, as a journalist, I would defend their right to write it. Apart from anything else, I read a fair amount of that kind of drivel about other people, so it would be hypocritical to take another view. But to give them any quote on a story like this is, to me, the first step down a steep staircase into hell. So all I ever issue is a terse no comment. And when the story is published, I don’t even read it. I just can’t bear to.So it wasn’t until Sunday afternoon that I realised they had written about my second marriage, to Maria Walsh, with whom I have a son. A close friend from Belfast called me, indignant and hurt that I had never told him about Maria and our progeny. The reason I had kept it from him was simple enough: that I don’t know anyone called Maria Walsh and, to the best of my knowledge, fathered no son with her or anyone else. Admittedly, I am getting forgetful why, only yesterday I went to take some shoes back to a shop and forgot to take the shoes with me. But it will be some time before I’m forgetful enough for a marriage and a child to slip my mind. So I hereby break my no comment rule to clarify this important matter: it’s wholly, totally and utterly untrue.It all started three years ago with a Daily Mail story that centred around me leaving a pub with a woman probably described as “a mystery brunette”. I say probably because, as ever, I couldn’t bring myself to read the story. Over the next few days I got several messages asking about someone called Maria. I assumed this was because the Mail had written that the woman in the photograph was called Maria. But then it transpired this was the first mention in print of my phantom marriage. Someone had put it on my Wikipedia page. I assume this someone had a friend called Maria Walsh who either loves or hates me and this was a jolly jape. Whatever. I tried to get it taken down but Wikipedia said I couldn’t, so I forgot about it, reasoning that any newspaper that just copied out Wikipedia (perish the thought) would get what it deserved.But, having been in print that once, it just would not go away. Eventually, my editor at 5 Live got it taken off Wikipedia, and that helped. But now the story is out there again. To be fair to the Mail on Sunday, it took the reference out straight away, but all week I’ve been doing badly at whack-a-mole trying to get it taken down on other websites that have republished it.As for compensation for this outrage, £10m should do it: £1 for me, and the rest to be shared between every Maria Walsh whose reputation is in tatters, having been accused of breeding with me.• Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aba399d73b705e2028028c5642990ef2f052dc7/0_129_2421_1452/master/2421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04079e8feb97764bc03945e0fa064f3e","title":"prince harry talking population royal family two children","story":"Oh Harry, it’s all a bit complicated isn’t it? From extracts released of a Vogue interview you have done with the great primatologist Jane Goodall, you imply that you plan to have just one more child because of your concerns about the environment.Well, compared with your parents and grandparents, that’s a good start. But the planet is not responding well to your jet-setting lifestyle, and two more little Sussexes adopting Dad and Mum’s ways won’t help.To make any difference to planet Earth, you and your family really must stop taking those private jets to Jamaica, the luxury safaris in Botswana, the weddings in Montego Bay, the impromptu winter getaways in Tromsø, the “babymoons” in Australia and New York, the downtime on Mediterranean islands and the quick flights to Fiji. Not to mention the ecological cost of living in all those grand houses and palaces or going on the royal tours.But you are right to link the fate of the planet with human population increase. It would be a dereliction of responsibility these days not to protect the planet, and many of the great conservationists, like Jane Goodall, David Attenborough and Chris Packham, recognise that the near tripling of human numbers in the past 70 years, along with the huge increase in the consumption of resources by the wealthy, have been responsible for the collapsing ecosystems, the climate crisis and pollution.So, of all the lifestyle choices you could make, having one less child is by far the best option. Research from Lund University in Sweden found that by choosing to have one less child, a parent would reduce their CO2 emissions by 58.6 tonnes a year during their lifetime over 25 times more than from any other action. Getting rid of the car, avoiding long-haul flights and going vegetarian are all well and good, but these actions, say the researchers, save very small amounts of CO2 in comparison with having one less child.And, Harry, you are no ordinary parent. In ecological terms you and your family are a herd of elephants trashing the forest. Over a lifetime, the average British-born babe will emit up to 150 times more CO2 than one born in Ethiopia. You are only 34, and you have probably already emitted more CO2 and other greenhouse gases than most of the 18 million people living in Malawi will do in their lifetimes.But it’s good that you spoke to Goodall, because very few people want to admit the inconvenient truth that population is a primary driver of global ecological crisis. Most political parties and environment groups are afraid to talk about it because it smacks of prejudice against countries with higher birth rates. How much easier to close the debate and blame all bioersity loss and climate change on the rich for their profligate lifestyles.Consumption matters, of course, but so do sheer numbers. World population, which currently stands at 7.5 billion, is increasing by 82 million people a year and looks likely to reach 11 billion within the lifetime of Prince Harry’s children. Sustaining another 3.5 billion people, or an extra India and China, will inevitably impact on climate, oceans and forests, and deplete natural resources. Many in areas of high growth want fewer children but cannot access contraception.However, population growth, resource consumption and environmental impact are closely linked, and there is little chance that the great extinction of species the world is seeing and the climate emergency can be turned round unless they are addressed together.As David Attenborough says: “It’s not just climate change it’s sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us. The natural world is doing it for us right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eba20eaec8e0de66bf8b74402d2ff6e42aa4b09/0_300_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0ec15adbb1d66dfa6f37529bf07a313","title":"holiday review an unlovely sojourn around the twisted male psyche","story":"Sex, violence and alpha-male malice collide with sickening consequences in Isabella Eklöf’s unflinching directorial debutLast year, the Danish film-maker Isabella Eklöf made a fierce impression on international audiences with the body-horror romance Border, the movie she had co-written, full of transgression, freakiness and loopiness. Now UK audiences can see her directorial debut Holiday (co-scripted by her with Johanne Algren), an icily accomplished drama about sexual violence, toxic masculinity and toxic femininity, in a pretty familiar Euro-hardcore style not dissimilar to the manner of shock veterans such as Ulrich Seidl or Gaspar Noé.It’s about a damaged and dysfunctional young woman gradually becoming complicit in the abusive relationship she is having with her middle-aged gangster employer: a kind of Stockholm-Vichy syndrome. He has invited her, with the rest of his sycophantic entourage, on a grisly “holiday” at the luxury apartment complex he has built in the Turkish resort of Bodrum, a business intended to mask his income from the drugs trade. With the glittering waters of the ocean and the Hockney blue of the infinity pools around which young women are expected to dance decorative attendance on fatter, older, paranoid guys, this is a world that can only be called Hate Island.Victoria Carmen Sonne gives a horribly convincing and mesmerically uncomfortable performance as Sascha, a young woman in skimpy swimwear who is the trophy girlfriend and abuse victim of Michael (Lai Yde), a gang boss who presides over a cringing court of mob lieutenants and their various mums and kids. Sonne brilliantly shows Sascha’s creepy, childlike narcissism, gazing at her reflection in changing room mirrors in a celebratory stupor. She zooms about the place on a motor-scooter, wearing a floating, trailing, Isadora Duncan-type scarf. A local tries to warn her about the danger of this accessory but Sascha won’t listen. Her cherubically blank face is imbued with a scary kind of knowingness that doesn’t really know much at all.These abuse-victim mannerisms are gruesomely juxtaposed by Eklöf with the menfolk’s entitlement. Michael has the bland complacency of what he imagines to be alpha-male seniority, but prickling with insecurity and resentment of slights real and imagined. Then there is the yet more sinister Bobby (Yuval Segal), another violent man with a pterodactyl expression whose abusive relationship with Sascha may or may not be known to Michael. On this ill-omened holiday, free-spirited Sascha finds herself flirting with Thomas (Thijs Römer) a handsome younger guy with a yacht – a status symbol that nettles Michael as much as anything else. The horror begins to impend.The centrepiece of this film is, heartsinkingly and inevitably, a rape that can only be watched through your fingers and made more brutal by the hard sunlit sheen of the production design and the rectilinear way the shot is set up. It goes on for an unbearably long time, and there is a moment when someone appears accidentally to walk in on the attack in the background, and then retreat out of shot: a sulphurous touch of callousness borrowed from Noé’s 2002 film Irréversible.Eklöf makes it clear that this event is all about male rage and male hate: it is a result of one of his male subordinates letting Michael down with a serious blunder. Has Holiday anything new to say about rape? Or do scenes like these fetishise sexual violence and irradiate it with a cinematic anti-glamour that fails to shed light on the banality of this particular evil? I’m not sure, but Eklöf does convey the idea that violence is internalised by the victim. Just as Michael’s errant male employee becomes extravagantly, almost puppyishly loyal as he dishes out apology gifts to the guys who had beaten him up, so Sascha begins to sink further into her mindset of sexual serfdom.It results in a dramatic scene of further violence that to me looked stylised and contrived. But there is no doubting the verve and style of Eklöf’s film-making – and the brutality from people on an open-ended holiday from ordinary human empathy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16b4fff3a67db340c5f6b150da1b03e4d82c04a/0_718_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d0ebfab1302af935c93079f153dad47","title":"samantha morton no regrets at working with woody allen","story":"The actor, who survived sexual abuse as a child, says director was ‘wonderful to work with’Samantha Morton has said she has “no regrets” working with Woody Allen and that she remains “forever grateful” for the experience.In an interview with Vanity Fair, Morton, who worked on Allen’s 1999 picture Sweet and Lowdown, said: “I was working for a director who was kind, funny, and wonderful to work with. It changed my life. And I’m forever grateful for that.” In Sweet and Lowdown Morton played a mute laundry woman who falls for jazz guitarist Emmett Ray (played by Sean Penn) she was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar.Morton said she didn’t have any regrets despite Allen facing accusations of abuse by his daughter Dylan Farrow that first emerged in 1992, and which the director denies. Morton spoke to the  in 2014 about her experience of being abused a number of times while in residential care.“I’m terribly sorry for the situation that is publicly known. It’s heartbreaking,” said Morton. “I was sexually abused. Some of the people that hurt me can’t be brought to justice for complications of time. I have full sympathy for anybody who says that happens to them, and it needs to be taken incredibly seriously.”In the wake of Farrow’s allegations against Allen, a number of the director’s former collaborators – including Timothée Chalamet, Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Rebecca Hall – have publicly stated they would not work with him again. Allen launched legal action against Amazon after they shelved A Rainy Day in New York, a film he shot for the studio in 2017, and they cancelled their contract with him, citing Farrow’s allegations and Allen’s response to the #MeToo campaign.However, a number of other actors, including Jude Law, Javier Bardem and Anjelica Huston, have defended their work with Allen and in Bardem and Huston’s case that they would be happy to work with him again.Allen is currently shooting a film in Spain, provisionally entitled Rifkin’s Festival, starring Christolph Waltz, Gina Gershon and Elena Anaya, saying: “I never think of retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad6055c513860aa5df6fe74f2e56b041dacfde4/835_2967_3287_1971/master/3287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ae87cd968c81f6025f3e9d8a9f60f6","title":"how to make strawberry shortcakes recipe","story":"As summery a dessert as they come, for lovers of strawberries and cream or sconesThough they have their origins in Britain, strawberry shortcakes feel to me like an American summer classic, redolent of long afternoons on the porch with a pitcher of iced tea. Which is not to say they’re not worth repatriating – short of serving up a big bowl of strawberries and cream, these fluffy, buttery little scones are the quickest way to go from fruit to feast.400g strawberries, hulled and washed 30g caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp extra2 stems mint, leaves finely chopped85g cold butter, plus 3 tbsp extra300g flour¼ tsp fine salt2½ tsp baking powder300ml whipping cream1 egg yolk, beaten with a little milk1 tsp demerara sugar, to sprinkleSeeds of 1 vanilla podCut the larger strawberries into quarters and smaller ones in half. Put about a third of them in a bowl (choose any that are slightly mushy, or indeed underripe, if there are any) and crush with a fork into a rough puree. Mix these back into the remaining cut fruit, along with the caster sugar and the chopped mint, and set aside while you make the shortcakes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7 and melt the extra three tablespoons of butter in a saucepan. Use some of this to lightly grease a large baking sheet, and set the rest aside in a warm place for later, stirring it occasionally if it threatens to solidify.Sift the flour into a large bowl, then whisk in the remaining tablespoon of caster sugar, the salt and the baking powder. Grate or cut in the cold butter, then rub this into the dry ingredients with your fingertips, until it looks like coarse breadcrumbs. Stir in 160ml of the cream, to make a soft dough, adding more cream if need be.Knead briefly, just until smooth (overworking the dough will make the cakes tough, so try to handle it as little as possible), then tip on to a lightly floured surface and roll or pat out until it’s about 5mm thick. Use a 6cm cutter to cut out eight rounds, twisting it as you push it down into the dough for a better rise.Put half the rounds on the greased baking sheet, brush the tops with melted butter, then put the other halves on top of them. Brush the tops of these with the beaten egg, sprinkle with the demerara sugar, then bake for about 20 minutes, until well risen and golden on top.Once the shortcakes are out of the oven, pull them apart as soon as they are cool enough to handle, and brush the middles with any remaining melted butter. Set aside on a rack to cool while you prepare the cream.Pour the cream into a large clean bowl and whip until it just starts to thicken. Use a sharp knife to scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod into the cream, and carry on whisking until you have soft, billowing peaks. Divide the bottoms of the shortcakes (the ones without the egg wash and demerara sugar topping) between four plates and put a blob of whipped cream on each.Put a generous spoonful of the strawberry compote on top of the cream, then finish by putting the tops on each shortcake. Do this gently and at an angle, so the filling is still visible (if you try to sandwich them on top, you’ll spoil the effect). Serve immediately, preferably while the shortcakes are still slightly warm.This recipe works with most summer fruit – raspberries, ripe peaches, plums or apricots, or lightly stewed gooseberries or currants – but you’ll need to adjust the sugar content depending on the fruit. In the case of stone fruits, you may wish to add a squeeze of lemon juice, too. If you use cooked fruit, give it time to cool, or it will melt the cream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddce67f7984ea3c223851eeced333cbcda3651db/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d262f3b6a1ced38e2d55bcfb1db3d745","title":"if its monday it must be moussaka how meal planning can save you stress and money","story":"Tired of scrabbling around for last-minute dinner ideas and throwing away unused perishables? These 10 tips will get you properly organisedKate Turner is aware that the chalkboard meal-planner in her Sussex kitchen can bewilder visitors. “Friends come round and go: ‘Wow, my God!’,” says the author of My Zero-Waste Kitchen. That breakfast, lunch and dinner wallchart (Wednesday: porridge Dad’s salad pilaf Thursday: cereal, tuna sandwiches spinach pie) may look overwhelming, but Turner insists: “It’s not scary. Not having to think about what you’re cooking is liberating. It saves money, time and stress.”Meal-planning has a way to go before it becomes mainstream, but it has long been a hit with weight-loss experts and wellness gurus, and the growing desire to cut food waste has led to a new wave of interest.True, using every scrap of your shopping across purposefully planned meals is a habit you have to develop. But whether you cook complex dishes from scratch every night or are more of a pasta-and-sauce person, to Turner, planning makes unbeatable ecological and financial sense. “If you’re wasting food, you’re wasting money,” she says. “I’m really keen this isn’t seen as a middle-class hobby. It’s a money-saver for anybody.”But where do you start? Here are 10 tips from experts.Whether you use a Google doc, a spreadsheet, a magnetic fridge whiteboard or a simple notepad, you first need to setup a seven-day planner that you can easily edit – one week being a reasonable timeframe in which to use fresh ingredients before they spoil. If you prefer, there are apps (Yummly, SideChef, Smart Recipes) that can help you pick meals and recipes and generate shopping lists.Make it enjoyable, urges the chef Miguel Barclay, the author of One Pound Meals: “You don’t have to start on Monday. Start on Friday night’s curry if that’s the meal you look forward to most, or Sunday roast if that’s non-negotiable. If cooking’s not exciting, in six months you’ll be back on takeaways.”A meal plan should not dictate your life. As you plan, jot down what you are doing each day (meeting mates for a drink after work, picking the kids up late from football) and think about what time you have to cook, if at all. Working across seven days gives you flexibility. You can stay late in the pub or order a takeaway on a whim without creating disastrous waste. “I can’t be rigid about it,” says Turner. “Work and family life don’t allow for that. If meals get shunted around the week, that’s fine.”Food offers infinite possibilities. To write a quick meal plan, you need to narrow them down, establishing a framework that works for you. You might start by choosing three meats a week, from a whole chicken to a pack of bacon, then select recipes that use those meats across two or three different meals. Or you might be led by leftovers: select three main meals you love, then choose recipes for the other days that use up any raw or cooked remants. Cooking dinner plus an extra portion for tomorrow’s lunch is a third way to minimise cost and waste.In choosing meats, think about leftovers. You can use cold roast beef as pie filling or in a sandwich but, arguably, it’s less user-friendly than leftover roast chicken, which can be used shredded in stir-fries, or in soups and salads.Another useful discipline is to stick to one type of cuisine each week (Indian, Italian, Chinese), so you don’t end up having to use leftover pak choi in a lasagne. “If you do Thai on Tuesday and pizza on Wednesday, you’ll have waste,” says Rachel Beckwith, the family editor at Good Food magazine.“Whatever I’ve got left over from my last dish, I use as the first piece of the jigsaw for my next recipe,” says Barclay, a pro chef with a vast mental Rolodex of ideas to draw on. But where should the rest of us look for inspiration? “Type ‘leftover chicken recipes’ into Google,” he suggests. “There’s the 10 best leftover chicken recipes, pictures, everything. There is no secret to finding recipes: just type it into Google, pick one, move on. Google are trying to make driverless cars. Do you not think they moved on to that after they sorted out the leftover-chicken recipes?”It needn’t be huge, but put together a store cupboard of basic carbs (dried pasta, lentils, rice) flavourings (soy sauce, stock cubes, dry herbs, spices) tins (pulses, tomatoes, tuna) and frozen veg, such as peas. You will be ready to tackle most planned meals.Browsing online can be helpful by showing you pack sizes as you write your meal plan, but deliveries can often include short-dated products or already ripe fruit that you need to speed-eat, disrupting that plan. Instead, shop in person, ideally somewhere you can weigh out the ingredients you need. Write your shopping list in a rough date order as a reminder to buy items with a longer sell-by date that you plan to use later in the week.Choose any deals wisely, warns Beckwith. “It’s a false economy if you buy something two-for-one and it goes bad in the fridge. Supermarkets want you to pay for that wastage.”“Chorizo and bacon are perfect examples,” says Barclay. “A little goes a long way, whereas something like steak is very poor value.”Use prime ingredients with a short shelf-life early, as through the week you will accumulate leftovers that require retooling – into a sausage, tomato and cabbage chilli pasta, say, or a one-pot stew. “I use more curries and bolognese-type recipes at the end of the week, where it doesn’t show if a courgette’s gone past its best. It’s more forgiving, especially things with spices,” says Beckwith.A well-organised freezer is the bedrock of minimal-waste meal planning. It allows you to save most leftovers or tired, withering items (bananas, pureed fruits, chopped onions and garlic, herbs blitzed into a pesto etc), and maintain a stash of meals to fall back on when you are too busy or cannot be mithered cooking.How you store things is a matter of taste and budget (reusable zip-lock bags, Tupperware, recycled plastic takeaway containers), but clearly label everything, including the date frozen and ideal use-by date, which will usually be within three months.“An hour or two of prep each weekend (making meals for the freezer or, perhaps cooking mince that you can turn into a shepherd’s pie) will make it far more likely that you stick to your meal plan during the week.A warning: test any recipes before you XXL them. Making a huge vat of revolting veggie chilli for the freezer that you reluctantly trudge through over several weeks will definitely erode your enthusiasm for this whole meal-planning malarkey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebea8b1f6a282bc428975f180d35eb8efbc8763a/0_308_4623_2774/master/4623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0efc44ea6111481cdfc702700eaed0c0","title":"premier league 201920 preview no 6 chelsea","story":"Frank Lampard is a popular choice with fans but he cannot make any signings and Eden Hazard leaves an enormous gap  writers’ predicted position: 4th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 33-1As a player Frank Lampard became a European champion, scored the goals that ended Chelsea’s 50-year wait for a league title and went to training with the sole intention of bettering himself every day. A relentlessly hard worker, he has thrown himself into management with a zeal that set him apart during his playing career and has earned a reputation for playing attractive football and giving youth a chance. As an added bonus he even appears to have heard of Chelsea’s academy, which should be good news for players such as Callum Hudson-Odoi and Mason Mount. Andreas Christensen, the 23-year-old Dane, will hope for more games in defence and Lampard’s influence is evidenced by Hudson-Odoi, long coveted by Bayern Munich, edging towards signing a new deal.On the face of it there is much to like about Lampard’s return to the club he knows inside out, where he is respected by the club’s notoriously hard-to-please board and revered by supporters who will feel waves of nostalgia and excitement wash over them when they see their manager in the away dugout at Old Trafford on 11 August. It is an appointment that makes sense on a number of levels, not least because installing Chelsea’s record goalscorer should have a restorative effect on the mood after a year dominated by less than complimentary chants about the quality of Sarriball.Yet for all the romance of Lampard’s homecoming, there are awkward realities to confront. After all, Chelsea have turned to a managerial novice to replace a coach who has been poached by Juventus. A coach who ended his debut campaign in England by finishing third in the Premier League and thumping Arsenal in the Europa League final. A coach who spent much of last season seemingly one game from the sack but succeeded in his primary objective of getting Chelsea back into the Champions League. A coach who was derided as a joke figure and barracked by supporters, only to walk into a job with the Serie A champions.In Sarri’s place arrives a 41-year-old who has been managing for a year, finished sixth in the Championship with Derby County and lost the play-off final to a more experienced English manager, Aston Villa’s Dean Smith. In different circumstances there is no chance that Chelsea would have asked Derby for permission to talk to Lampard.But appointing Lampard now leads us to another thorny issue: Chelsea’s inability to make signings until next summer after being handed a two-window transfer ban by Fifa. It threatens to be a major impediment given that they finished 26 points behind Manchester City and 25 behind Liverpool, numbers which explain why Sarri spent much of the early part of last season cooling talk of a title challenge. Why would one of Europe’s top managers come to Chelsea at this stage?Lampard probably would have welcomed a few signings. Instead he arrives just as Eden Hazard departs, sold to Real Madrid for £88.5m, the lure of the Bernabéu finally proving too strong for the brilliant little Belgian to ignore. Chelsea, so often reliant on Hazard, are unlikely to be better off without their one truly elite talent and they are unable to replace him with a marquee signing.At least Christian Pulisic, bought for £58m from Borussia Dortmund before Fifa’s punishment landed, has arrived to fill the creative void. The American can play in the hole or on the flanks and could provide excitement. Yet the 20-year-old will need time to settle and the unfortunate truth for Lampard is that his attack looks far less daunting without Hazard. Pedro and Willian can flatter to deceive and Hudson-Odoi is recovering from an achilles injury. As for the strikers, Olivier Giroud has rarely been a consistent force in the Premier League, neither Sarri nor Conte was convinced by Michy Batshuayi and Tammy Abraham, scorer of 25 goals during his loan at Villa last season, is unproven at this level.Then again it has been a long time since Chelsea have had a manager willing to give a raw young talent such as Abraham a proper chance. Enough doom and gloom. One of the best reasons for fast-tracking Lampard is that his readiness to promote youngsters offers a straightforward way to rejuvenate the team – and having Jody Morris, who developed a glowing reputation during five years working in Chelsea’s academy, as his assistant will help in that regard.There is a sense that Chelsea are building for the future. So ruthless in the Roman Abramovich era, it is possible to detect a willingness to give Lampard space to breathe and grow. Hiring Petr Cech as a technical and performance adviser is a sign of a desire to build a proper structure around Lampard.Such assurances will give Lampard the confidence to trust in his vision. He showed at Derby that he can improve young players. Chelsea entrusted him with Mount and Fikayo Tomori, both of whom have returned as better players. Mount will press for a spot in midfield, Tomori in defence, while Jake Clarke-Salter and Reece James will hope to catch Lampard’s eye.The transfer limbo also means Lampard may offer second chances to outcasts such as Danny Drinkwater and members of Chelsea’s returning loan army, with Kurt Zouma hoping to challenge in central defence after a year at Everton, Kenedy an option on the wing after a year at Newcastle and the midfielder Tiémoué Bakayoko keen to prove himself after spending last season at Milan.Raw materials are at Lampard’s disposal. But he must ensure the positives outweigh the negatives. In goal Kepa Arrizabalaga is a goalkeeper with vast potential. In central defence Antonio Rüdiger has emerged as a commanding leader. César Azpilicueta remains dependable at right-back, Emerson has made the left-back spot his own after dislodging Marcos Alonso and Lampard’s apparent preference for 4-2-3-1 over Sarri’s 4-3-3 should allow N’Golo Kanté to play a more central role next to the deep-lying orchestrator Jorginho, a isive figure last season.Moving Kanté inside ought to solidify a side beaten 4-0 by Bournemouth and 6-0 by City last season. Yet questions linger. Can Lampard succeed where others have failed and curb David Luiz’s rash tendencies? Is Ross Barkley capable of a consistent run of form? Was it a mistake to sign Mateo Kovacic, an underwhelming presence on loan from Madrid, on a permanent basis? Will Ruben Loftus-Cheek be the same after injury? Do Giroud, Batshuayi and Abraham convince up front? And will there be enough spark without Hazard?Lampard will need time to come up with the right answers. Unable to lean on Hazard’s genius, it will not be easy keeping up with Pep Guardiola, Jürgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino. This is a transitional period and Chelsea should regard anything more than a top-four finish and a decent Champions League run as a bonus.Still, imagine the excitement if it is Lampard leading a title charge. For all the current uncertainty it would be a hell of a story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfbed2816e4b52920d5827244c4eeff0961752fa/67_0_1293_776/master/1293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=115150e3894d1cb71cc792d420df85bd","title":"toni duggan signs atletico madrid women leaving barcelona","story":"The England forward Toni Duggan has signed for Atlético Madrid Women, two months after she praised their fans for booing and abusing her when she played for Barcelona at the Wanda politano last season.Duggan left Barcelona at the end of the campaign after two seasons and has joined Atlético, who are aiming for a fourth consecutive league title, on a two-year contract.“I had several different offers – from all around the world – but at this stage in my career, I wanted to join a side that is consistently challenging for honours and Atletico’s record is incredible,” the 28-year-old said. “I’ve seen this team up close over the last couple of years and they are a real force.“When I visited the new training ground I was extremely impressed.

It is often used by international travellers as a gateway to DRC.The Ebola outbreak in DRC began exactly a year ago on Thursday and has claimed more than 1,803 lives, according to figures published on Wednesday, making it the second deadliest outbreak of the disease on record.The second patient began showing symptoms of the disease on 22 July, after arriving in Goma from DRC’s northeastern Ituri province, according to Associated Press reports.Aruna Abedi, in charge of coordinating the Ebola response in North Kivu, the worst-hit province, said the second patient had already been ill for 11 days before he sought treatment.“His was really a hopeless case, because the illness was already at an advanced stage and he died overnight Tuesday,” Abedi said.The case is not connected to the one previously detected in Goma.The escalating crisis has led to a row within the DRC’s health ministry, which is co-ordinating national efforts to contain the spread of the virus.Last week, DRC’s health minister Olly Ilunga resigned in protest against the country’s handling of the Ebola outbreak. Ilunga said international agencies were pressuring his government to allow the testing of a new vaccine developed by Johnson \u0026amp Johnson. The row over the vaccine trials began after Ilunga banned clinical trials of the new vaccine in DRC, according to Stat News.Ebola vaccines are difficult to develop because they have to be tested during outbreaks.In the previous outbreak in West Africa, one vaccine, produced by Merck, was successfully trialled in Guinea. The success of that trial meant preventative Merck vaccines could be given to citizens in the DRC and potentially contain the outbreak.But Ilunga has argued that trialling vaccines in Ebola-affected regions could erode public trust in the government.Merck’s vaccine requires only a single shot, whereas Johnson\u0026amp Johnson’s new vaccine has to be taken in two doses.Officials and NGOs fear that discrepancies in the vaccination schedules – where some people were getting one shot, while others were getting two – could fuel rumours about the vaccines in local communities.Ilunga also said that delivering two doses would be logistically difficult in a region where there is a high rate of displacement and where people frequently travel.“How can you, in an environment where people are traveling a lot, where people have no identity card, how can you organise a two-dosage vaccination in rural areas?” he was reported as saying. “You vaccinate somebody today and say, ‘Come back two months later’ … even from a logistical point of view, it’s not feasible.”Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, who is now heading the Ebola response in DRC said Goma had been preparing for more Ebola cases for many months, and that the latest patient would receive treatment at a facility in the city."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3907a894baec51a45f0e7a664a60e10b993372/0_62_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75023f2a80a5d29b4691209acf54da66","title":"honduras community coastal towns rising sea le","story":"Rising sea levels are destroying coastal towns in Honduras – and shrimp farms which export to the UK and US are making it worseby  Nina Lakhani in Cedeño, CholutecaEric Pineda runs a modest beachfront restaurant which serves up plates of fresh fish and rice – and faces imminent destruction.A recent tidal surge razed the nightclub next door, leaving a pastel pink ruin, and in the past two years, several other businesses between Pineda’s property and the Pacific Ocean have been destroyed by sudden waves.“Every year, the ocean is getting closer and higher. I think we’ve got a year – maybe two – before the water takes us too,” said Pineda, 24. “It won’t be long.”Golden beaches once helped transform this fishing community on the Gulf of Fonseca into a thriving tourist destination. Nowadays, however, there are barely a few metres of sand left, and rising water levels and tidal surges have wiped out roads, homes and businesses. Locals estimate that around a metre of ground is lost every year – which means this entire community will soon be under water. The same predicament is faced by settlements along the Pacific coast of Honduras, where land and its people are disappearing fast.In recent years, millions of people have fled Central America to escape grinding poverty, institutional collapse and untrammeled violence. But another factor behind the exodus has received less attention: conflicts over natural resources which have been intensified by corporate expansion and climate change.Sea levels are rising around the world, but in this region another local factor is helping speed up coastal degradation: swathes of mangrove forests have been destroyed to make way for industrial shrimp farms which have proliferated even inside protected reserves.Many Honduran shrimps are exported to the US and the UK, where they are sold in major supermarket chains including Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Marks \u0026amp Spencer.“The industry destroys huge mangrove sites promising development, but actually creates very few jobs – and actually increases poverty by restricting fishing access for locals,” said Dina Morel, director of a local marine conservation organization, known by its acronym Coddeffagolf.According to Morel, shrimp farms are routinely approved in protected areas and environmental violations rarely punished as officials often have vested interests in the profitable industry.“The consequences of losing this essential ecosystem are clear,” said biologist Víctor Bocanegra. “Environmental vulnerability, food insecurity, poverty and social decomposition, which all leads to forced migration.”Mangroves are essential to healthy, resilient coastlines. The sturdy trees protect shorelines from storms and floods, and help prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments with their intertwined roots.They are key factors in marine bioersity, providing food, clean water, shelter and safety for fish and invertebrates such as crabs, lobsters and prawns.In order to take advantage of this natural symbiosis, acres and acres of shrimp farms have been built inland in ocean inlets which were once safe havens for tidal waves. But the farms block the natural flow of water, causing high tides and storm surges to immerse beach communities instead.On Cedeño beach, Ariana Tees, 70, is frying fish caught by her husband, Manuel, 67, in a makeshift tarpaulin kitchen just metres from the sea. This is where they live, work, eat and sleep, but every month they are forced further and further back as the ocean inches closer inland.“Of course we’re scared,” said Tees. “But we’ve nowhere else to go, and there’s no protection from the government, not even a barrier.”Manuel, who has been fishing since he was a child, said: “Every year there is less fish, and the surges have nowhere to go – so the water comes here looking for an exit. We’ve woken up in the middle of the night surrounded by water.”The shrimp industry in southern Honduras dates back to the 1970s, but grew exponentially in the 1990s. As a result, in 2000, seven mangrove forests covering over 150,000 acres were designated protected reserves.Despite this, half the region’s mangroves were destroyed between 2000 and 2010 – largely as a result of fishing concessions sanctioned before the decree, according to research by Coddeffagolf.No one knows exactly how much of the protected areas remain intact, but satellite images seen by the  suggest the situation is critical.The extent of the deforestation can be seen from a mountain peak in San José de Las Conchas, 20 miles north of Cedeño, where the panorama reveals only slivers of protected mangroves nestled between massive manmade shrimp lagoons and the turquoise ocean.Locals say shrimp companies build farms in secret – hidden from view by a ring of mangroves – then obtain permits retrospectively.FundeSur, a social responsibility foundation created by the shrimp industry in 2014, claims to invest $0.02 for every pound of shrimp exported into health, education and environmental projects.But reforestation programmes, which require years of nurturing to ensure hardy shrubs, are rare. FundeSur did not respond to repeated requests for comment.“There is more deforestation than reforestation, that’s evident for everyone to see,” said Nelson Martínez, a grassroots organiser from Guapinol, a nearby community badly damaged by a tidal surge three years ago. “Unless the mangroves are saved, Guapinol will disappear too.”A thin strip of land sandwiched between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, Central America is especially vulnerable to the global climate emergency.Hurricane Mitch – the most deadly storm in the western hemisphere in over two centuries – left at least 8,000 people dead and a million others homeless and landless when it struck in 1998. It set the country’s economic development back at least 50 years and triggered the first wave of post-cold war Central American migration to the US.Yet, investment in climate mitigation and adaption programmes such as reforestation and flood defences is falling.Since a 2009 coup, a profusion of water-guzzling megaprojects – including dams, mines, and African palm plantations – has fuelled social conflicts, state repression and migration.Berta Cáceres, a Goldman environmental prize winner, was murdered in March 2016 in retaliation for leading opposition to the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the river Gualcarque, relied upon by the indigenous Lenca people for food, water and medicines.“The key issue connecting climate change and governments is water governance – the politics deciding who gets priority to enough good quality water,” said Professor Raúl Pacheco-Vega, an environmental politics scholar at the centre for economic research and teaching (Cide) in Mexico.In Honduras, the upshot of water politics is stark: every year during the rainy season, countless communities are cut off, lives are lost, and roads, bridges and schools are damaged. It is a cycle of environmental destruction that exacerbates poverty and drives migration as families search for food, water and safety.In October, six people were killed after two days of torrential rain triggered landslides and the River Choluteca burst its banks. The town of Marcovia, 14 miles inland from Cedeño, was inundated and its habitants forced to leave.Soon after, hundreds of people from the nearby city of Choluteca joined a caravan of migrants heading north through Mexico to the US border.Half a million Hondurans heading north have been apprehended by US and Mexican officials since October 2016.The motives for migration are always complex, but in this region, environmental factors are increasingly important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86ae47f3e45c7e2286ee895777fbd1e456d86816/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cee11c622e6629d8a3710bfe69e43a0","title":"god land lyz lenz excerpt journey find church","story":"After a lifetime of attending evangelical churches, Lyz Lenz went on a journey to find a place where she didn’t need to pretend to be an obedient wife, and not much else Since moving to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 2005, my husband Dave and I had attended almost 20 churches. One church we went to never invited us into a Bible study. When I asked a pastor or a Sunday school teacher about Wednesday night Bible studies, I was always told to ask someone else, who told me to ask someone else. This went on for five months, until one Sunday the pastor preached a sermon about the importance of small groups and said from the pulpit that all we had to do was ask to be invited. We never went back.Or there was the church we visited in 2006 that sent three teams of elders to prayer walk around our townhouse. I sent them packing after I opened the door and asked them what they were doing. “Can we speak to your mom?” asked one of the older gentlemen in a suit and a tie.“I am the mom,” I said and slammed the door shut. They left a flyer under the door and walked around our townhouse praying once more, for good measure.After three years of searching, Dave and I finally ended up at an Evangelical Free church. There we met other couples and got involved with the youth group. But even then, that church wasn’t an easy fit for us. Or, I should be clear, it wasn’t an easy fit for me.The church was a lot like the Evangelical churches Dave and I had attended as kids – raucous music, a pastor who gave sermons that often included video clips and pop culture references. There was no liturgy, there were no organs and most of the people who attended seemed to be our age. Few people drank, no one smoked and they all loved to discuss the Book of Revelation after one too many Mountain Dews at a church party.While I loved the people there, I didn’t like the church’s theology. The church was and is very conservative their theology was that of the Evangelical Free Church of America, which doesn’t affirm women or gay people as pastors or elders. Strict gender roles were enforced and even seen as freeing. Everybody was white.As someone who doesn’t like to wear bras on principle, I frequently found myself chafing against the strict orthodox interpretation of the Bible and the long lectures I was often given by male members of the church about how if I believed women could be pastors I was questioning the inerrancy of the Bible.But in those early days of my marriage and my adult life, I thought that these problems were minor squabbles. Something to be hashed out over late nights playing board games and drinking wine, or wine for me, Fresca for the rest of them. It was a breezy naivety, born of my childhood raised in an Evangelical homeschool subculture in Texas. Until I went to high school at a public school, everyone I knew believed in a literal six-day creation by the hand and voice of God. Everyone believed that being gay was a sin.I was used to being the outsider – the lone voice of dissent. I was comfortable with this role because I wasn’t threatened by it. Not yet, anyway. I wasn’t gay. I wasn’t a person of color. I was a woman, but the gentle grasp of patriarchy hadn’t yet threatened to strangle me, because I hadn’t yet tried to get free. Or perhaps I had, but I was so used to a religion that told me I was wrong and objectionable, it never occurred to me there could be another way.Faith was also so much more to me than a God I occasionally sang songs to in church or prayed to over meals. Faith had provided the entire fabric of my existence. It was the cytoplasm in which I existed – the amniotic fluid that sustained my relationships with my husband and my family. It’s the air I was raised with. My mother read the Bible to us in the mornings, and my father read it to us before I went to sleep at night. I could not conceive of myself outside of religion.Because I could not imagine life outside the womb of my faith, I struggled inside its limitations. I thought there would always be room for me. But the reality was, there was only room for me if I made myself smaller and smaller and smaller, until I disappeared. Or else I’d be pushed out into a bright new horrible, beautiful world, where I would gasp and scream and try to breathe, for once, on my own.But in those early days, I kicked around, trying to make my place, approaching my disagreements head on. During a membership class at our Evangelical church, the one we’d later leave, I eagerly debated the head pastor, Travis, over whether the Bible supported female ordination. My husband, who agreed with the church’s stances, sat stony-faced as I recited the arguments I’d learned from my Lutheran friends and from reading books such as Ten Lies the Church Tells Women. The pastor gamely debated me, but stood strong. “I agree the topic needs more investigation” was all he would allow.And I took it, that proffered breadcrumb, as a promise to journey together – to listen to one another. I took it as a sign of respect. And that’s all I needed. I didn’t need to be right, I just needed to be treated like someone smart, someone with something to offer besides filling a nursery volunteer spot on Sunday mornings. I needed to be treated like a person.The promised investigation never came. That offer was just a way of putting me off, shutting me up. A year later, when I asked if we could have a Bible study that opened up the topic, I wasn’t shut down, I was just ignored. I asked the question of the pastor and he smiled and said: “I’ll think about it.” Nothing else. And every time I brought it up, that’s what I was told. “I’ll think about it.”Death by a thousand maybes.It’s a passive-aggressive technique – a denial by silence. There is nothing to fight against. Just resolute lips and an unfocused gaze, that refuses to see you, your desperation, humanity and longing. I’m used to that look. I get it a lot. Or at least, I used to.I’ve spent my whole life in conservative Evangelical churches. Born the second of eight kids and raised in Texas, I spent my spiritual childhood hearing hour-long sermons in humid, brown churches filled with the Holy Spirit and brisket and pastors who sweat through their shirtsleeves proclaiming the second coming of the Lord.In Sunday school, we looked for signs and revelations of the impending apocalypse: the tentative peace recently brokered in the Middle East, the talk of rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem, the war on religion we were told that Janet Reno was perpetuating with the attacks on Ruby Ridge and Waco. I went to sleep afraid I’d wake up to find my whole family raptured. When I went to the toilet, I prayed to Jesus not to call me up to heaven right then and there with my pants pulled down.At home my father taught us that numerology showed Hillary Rodham Clinton’s name worked out to 666. My mother made us read The Hiding Place, and we talked about what we’d do in the end times when we were persecuted for our faith.I read Frank Peretti’s books, hiding under the covers, dreaming about the thin veil between the spiritual world and the one where I bit my nails and prayed for Jesus to make me good. I was no good in the churches of my childhood – I was too loud, too demanding, I looked too much like a boy, I asked too many questions.By the time I was 18 years old, I’d been in small churches where pastors slept with congregants and in megachurches where youth pastors slept with teens. I’d seen gay women kicked out of the congregations they loved because they wouldn’t apologize for who God created them to be. I’d seen my friend, pregnant at 16, asked to stop singing with the worship team, while the boy who was the father still led prayers on Wednesday nights. By the time I finally went to college, I had given up. For four years, I never went to chapel. I still believed in God, but I didn’t believe in church.After I graduated and married Dave, who’d been raised in the soft evangelicalism of the upper-middle-class white midwestern suburbs, I was determined that we would find a new church together one that fit both of us.We moved to Cedar Rapids for his job, and the first thing he did was make a list of all the churches he wanted to visit. Without my input. In hindsight, this wasn’t a good sign. But it’s also how he put together our budget, planned vacations and bought cars. I had a choice – and that choice was to choose from the options on his spreadsheet. And when you are young and in love and used to the patriarchy as a modus operandi, well, you put up with a lot of things without thinking.Dave and I worked through the list in alphabetical order until we finally settled into the Evangelical Free church. We weren’t looking for perfection, we just wanted a home. Or, more accurately, I wanted a home. I wanted a place that would accept all of me. Where I wouldn’t be forced to hide my questions and my doubts, swallow my fears and outrage and get along. Perhaps that’s why, when Pastor Travis told me we’d talk about it later or that he was thinking about my idea of the Bible study examining the woman’s role in the church, I took him at his word.Compliance is easier than questioning. The appearance of unity is easier than the messy actualities. And I think part of me always understood that if I pushed too hard, I would be cast out of everything I knew. That I’d lose everything. So I smiled during sermons I hated. I kept silent during Bible studies where people spoke of dinosaurs and humans roaming the earth together before Noah’s flood.Dave and I put everything into that church. We volunteered with the youth on Wednesday nights, I helped with the coffee every Sunday and in the nursery, and we went on a trip to Israel and on a mission trip to El Salvador.On that mission trip, everything fell apart. It fell apart because I asked to lead the prayer during devotionals one morning. Steven, the pastor leading the group, had frowned and told me that wasn’t my place. I was furious. I had a specific story I wanted to share. One of our local hosts, a woman and a pastor, had taken me with her on her visits to the sick people in the village. I’d used my Spanish-English dictionary to talk to a man about how my sisters had been hit by a car, just like he had. How one of my sisters also had a hard time walking. It was a small moment of connection that I wanted to tell everyone about, and I wanted to pray for him.But Steven was upset because I had been with a female pastor, and he didn’t think it was my place to be leading even devotions in our majority male group. Steven’s approach even angered Dave. When I had told Steven that nothing in the Bible prevented me from talking out loud in a small group, he replied by saying: “It’s there in the scripture, right here where you are told to submit.”When Dave and I returned from the trip, we met with Pastor Travis and voiced our concerns. We had heard that other people had similar concerns with this same pastor, and I said that.“You know who,” I said. “They told me they told you.”“No one told me anything,” he said.My husband spoke up. “We know people have talked to you about how this man treats people.”Pastor Travis bowed his head and folded his hands for a moment. When he looked up, he met my husband’s eyes and said: “You are right. I don’t know why I lied and I apologize to you.”“Apologize to me,” I said. “You lied to me, not to him.”“I did apologize to you when I apologized to your husband,” Pastor Travis replied, looking not at me but at Dave. We had been going to that church for five years together and here I was, not even worthy of an apology.I had trusted Pastor Travis. I had believed that, even though we disagreed, he saw me as a human – smart, worthy of time and consideration. But in that moment, with his resolute lips and gaze focused somewhere over my head, I saw that I wasn’t a whole person to him. I wasn’t even worthy of my own apology. Whatever story I had told myself about mutual respect turned out to be just a lie. That offer to “journey together” was just a coded way of saying: “You’ll eventually grow up and agree with me.” It wasn’t the last time I heard that phrase.Pastor Travis and Steven did try to reach out with apologies for the misunderstandings, but I refused to speak to them. There was no misunderstanding. I thought I was a smart person, fully capable of studying the Bible and engaging with spirituality on my own, and they disagreed. When someone denies the very core of who you are, it’s hard to dialogue.There are so many churches that remain strong while being awful to women or providing safe havens for the power hungry. And there are so many good places that close despite being a home for the hungry, the lost and the hurting. To brush off problems with churches as the problems of the inherently flawed nature of people is to miss the bigger picture: that life and faith can function together in a place where all are welcome and respected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6aefd97f434b32265052e1764fac1503f843c8/0_34_8451_5071/master/8451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbb096b621ef37eae582ac11f56b1979","title":"safety blanket why more teenagers relying life coaches","story":"We think of life coaching as something for middle-aged executives, yet 17- and 18-year-olds are increasingly signing up. Is it for career advice – or because they help assuage loneliness?When Josh Dixon was excluded from school for antisocial behaviour, he thought the prospect of a happy life was over. He was in his mid-teens, after a period in which he had been bullied. “It felt like everyone had given up on me and that I’d either end up in a life of crime, like my other friends who were excluded, or in a dead-end job,” he says. Now 20, Dixon runs his own recruitment consultancy, which he says has an annual turnover of £2.5m. He credits this swift change of fortune to an unlikely, but increasingly common, path for young people: hiring a life coach.For Dixon, it was a crucial step in regaining his confidence. He was referred to a local coaching charity by a teacher and began going twice a week. “Initially, I was very sceptical. I was worried that whatever I talked about would be shared with the school and I didn’t want that, because I was ashamed of my situation,” he says. “But, after three months, the life coach began getting through to me and she broke it down, showing me the negative things I was doing and where it would lead me, compared with the positives I could gain if I just made different life choices.” These included continuing his education. “Little successes like finishing college were massive in building my confidence. She also made me realise that I didn’t need social media I didn’t need to keep comparing myself with other people and searching for approval,” he says.Hailey Yatros, a 26-year-old life coach, says the internet is a key reason why young people are seeking coaching. “This generation leans on social media as their means of connection to other people and they don’t really have anything else,” she says. “A lot of them get a coach to not be alone. I had a client once who had over 7,000 followers on Instagram and she didn’t have anyone in her life she could confide in if she needed to.”One of the most common questions Yatros receives from clients is what their purpose in life should be. “I laugh when young people come to me asking how they should live their lives, because you’re not meant to know that when you’re in your teens,” she says. “Your life purpose is meant to evolve over time and that question should be asked more than once. Lots of young people feel that, if they don’t get what they want right now, they’ll never get it. They forget they’re playing a long game.”Yatros is one of a new generation of life coaches in their 20s who approach their young clients with a deeper understanding of the issues they face, since they have similar concerns. Coaching is unregulated, so anyone could call themselves a coach, although Yatros took a qualification through a Dale Carnegie training course at 19. “When I started, I had clients who were in their 40s, but age has nothing to do with it,” she says. “It’s about your experiences and what you’ve learned. My clients didn’t care how old I was, because we live in a society where people are so thirsty for help: if you can help them, they’ll absolutely take it.”Life coaching is not to be confused with therapy. “You go to therapy because something is broken and you want it to be fixed,” says the life coach Michael Bungay Stanier, “whereas in coaching we have the philosophy that you’re resourceful, creative and whole and it’s about amplifying what’s working now. Coaching is often short-term – six to 12 months – and very positive and goal-oriented, whereas therapy can move much slower and much deeper.” Counselling and therapy qualifications are also more widespread than life coaching, with services accessible via the NHS in the UK – a provision that does not extend to coaching.Bungay Stanier is 51 and has been coaching for more than 20 years. He thinks the increase in interest among young people is not only down to the anxieties and loneliness wrought by social media, but also because the idea of actively pursuing a career has been destigmatised. “When I started, people would get a coach because they were a bit messed up or were struggling,” he says. “But now coaching is seen as a helpful space to figure stuff out – it’s almost a badge of honour to show people you’re committed to getting the best out of your life.” He also credits its popularity to a greater sense of questioning among young people. “When I was growing up, it was all about buckling down and working the system. Millennials, though, don’t want to put up with the bullshit or jump through hoops they’re always asking themselves: ‘What do I want?’ which is a profound and really difficult question.” Coaching can offer them different perspectives, he says.One year into college, Allison Rosengard, 21, who lives in Boston in the US, found herself asking what her life’s purpose would be. “I was anxious at the time, because my whole childhood was geared up towards getting to college, then once you’re there you’re totally alone. I didn’t have much direction,” she says. “Life coaching felt like a safety blanket, connecting with someone who had been there only five or 10 years before me, with similar experiences.”Rosengard’s coach was Kali Rogers, the 31-year-old founder of Blush, a service aimed at young women. “Women need a safe space,” Rogers says. “So, it was important for me to build a platform where they wouldn’t feel judged.” Rogers was also kicking against the stereotypes. “People think that life coaching is just for middle-aged men when I started, all I could find was male executive coaches. I wanted to break the stigma and show that you don’t have to be a man making a million dollars a year, sitting in a corner office, to have this luxury. You can be a 22-year-old woman at her first job and thinking: ‘Is this my life?’”Rosengard has been seeing Rogers for five years. “A good coach is a mentor in all things – they show you how to be an adult,” Rosengard says. “Initially, I would get a lot of questions from people asking whether I was seeing a therapist and why I needed it, but there’s a greater awareness now. As self-care becomes more popular, the surprised reaction to having a life coach has gone away.” Rosengard’s work with Rogers has led her into a career as a management consultant.Increasingly, young people are choosing life coaching itself as their profession. “The career is growing rapidly,” says Magdalena Mook, the CEO of the ICF. “We have 900 new members joining each year, with many Gen Zs training. They will be the future of the profession, as they really see it as a viable career choice.”Harry Langdon, 26, is based in Jersey and has been practising for three years. “I became obsessed with personal development and enabling people to get the best out of themselves,” he says. “Coaching seemed like the only career choice that would add a sense of purpose to my life. I knew I could connect well with younger people and that they would trust me, because I’m a millennial myself. The demand has been huge.”With prices ranging from £45 a session to £500 and above, it is cost rather than any stigma that seems the biggest barrier to accessing a coach. Gabby Carpenter, 19, hired a coach two years ago, when she was applying to get into university. “I had to use all the money I was making in my summer job to afford the sessions, but I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to my peers,” she says. “It might seem a bit woo-woo, but that investment gave me the confidence and structure to get into medical school and will pay off for the rest of my career. It sets you up for life.” Carpenter also believes that the skills she learned through coaching will help her as a doctor. “Coaching teaches you how to communicate properly and how to prioritise different aspects of your life, which is something that we Gen Zs have struggled with,” she says. “We’ve grown up with technology and distractions – we almost have to learn how to look someone in the eye.”With a new branch of his recruitment company having just opened in Manchester, Dixon plans to continue seeing his own life coach. “You end up building a really close mentor-like relationship,” he says. “She’s really helped me get that balance between ambition, purpose and life. Young people just need to slow down once we do, we finally have the space to figure out what we’re good at. From there, we can build much better, more considered lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cbb5675abae34334a944e4b9db7576954febcf6/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f8ceae9ccd1e65655cb6afef93f05f","title":"why would a woman marry her dog","story":"Elizabeth Hoad and her dog, Logan, tied the knot live on This Morning earlier this week – and they’re not the first to do soA woman married her dog. Eamonn Holmes gave the bride away. The groom, a golden retriever, wore a top hat. Love Island’s Kem Cetinay acted as a ring-bearer. It played out live and like a David Lynch fever dream on ITV’s This Morning on Tuesday. One viewer called it “deeply uncomfortable viewing”. “There has to be law against marrying your bloody dog,” tweeted another.There is, actually – the only legal marriage is between two human beings – but there were a few giveaways that this was not a solemn occasion. Alison Hammond, officiating, struggled to keep it together as she called for those present to voice any “bones of contention” as to why Elizabeth Mary Francis Hoad and six-year-old Logan Humphrey the Second should not be wed. No one said the obvious – “How long have you got?” – but Logan did offer a Tim-from-The-Office-style haunted look to camera.What would move a woman to marry her dog, even symbolically? Before the ceremony, Hoad, 49,  told This Morning that after four failed engagements, 220 dates and a range of unsatisfactory experiences in the search for love – men concealing wives, men her age pursuing younger women – she had given up on the male of her species.Logan, on the other hand, has been a constant in her life since she adopted him a year ago. “He’s saved me and I’ve saved him. I was broken before I got him.” It wasn’t just her, Hoad said – many of her friends preferred the company of their dogs to men. She is not even the first woman to marry one.Wilhelmina Morgan Callaghan, from Northern Ireland, got hitched to her yorkshire terrier, Henry, in 2009, because “dogs are better than men” and “I know I’m with Henry for life”. Lilly Smartelli, 55, of Phoenix, Arizona, told the New York Times earlier this year of her plans to wed Bernie, her poodle-cross, to know the joy of being married to her best friend before she died. Her only misgiving? The expense. “He’s always there for me. He listens, and he loves me no matter what. What more could a woman want?”Dog ownership’s links to lower stress, less loneliness and better mental and physical health well established, Hoad’s chances of living happily ever after might indeed be higher with Logan than if she settled for some desultory date. A 2010 study found that women might benefit in particular. Conversely, earlier this year, Paul Dolan – a professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics – asserted that men benefited from marriage where women didn’t.To even the score, Dolan wrote in response to the ensuing outrage, we “needed to start by caring less about what kinds of relationships other people choose to have, and how they live their lives. If they are not harming us, why should it matter?” One might put the point to This Morning. Tracey Emin famously married a rock “because it’s not going anywhere” – but a dog will actually love you back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d836dcd01b33f21198e8d15a8cdcb13ca628ffa/0_189_4250_2551/master/4250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b73f62ded41b69463a91eeb16654151","title":"football world calls on saudi arabia to stop pirating of matches","story":"Fifa, Uefa and Premier League ask Saudi government to clamp down on beoutQ The world’s biggest football authorities, including those who run the Premier League, World Cup and Champions League, have called on Saudi Arabia to take action to stop a sophisticated, homegrown pirate TV and streaming service that is illegally broadcasting matches internationally.The strongly worded letter from the exasperated sports bodies – including Fifa, Uefa, Germany’s Bundesliga, Spain’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A as well as the Asian Football Confederation – comes after almost 18 months fruitlessly attempting to mount a legal challenge in Saudi Arabia to block the service, called beoutQ.“We collectively condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing theft of our intellectual property by the pirate broadcaster known as beoutQ and call on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to support us in ending the widespread and flagrant breaches of our intellectual property rights,” the authorities said in a joint statement.The sporting bodies have said that nine legal firms in Saudi Arabia have failed to take on their copyright theft case and that they are now being forced to seek other means to shut down the broadcaster.“We have reached the conclusion, regrettably, that it is now not possible to retain legal counsel in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia which is willing or able to act on our behalf,” the statement continued. “We see no alternative but to pursue beoutQ and a solution to this very serious problem of piracy by other means. We request that the Saudi ministry of culture and the Saudi government take swift and decisive action against beoutQ.”The illegal service had a surge in popularity after making global headlines for pirate broadcasting the entire 2018 World Cup. Earlier this month the All England Lawn Tennis Club condemned beoutQ for illegally streaming Wimbledon worldwide for a second year running. The BBC and Sky have also previously spoken out about the issue of piracy of their programming.The beoutQ service is transmitted internationally on 10 channels by the Saudi-headquartered satellite firm Arabsat, which counts the Saudi state as its largest shareholder, and also offers streaming.The pirate service was launched in 2017 when Saudi Arabia mounted an economic boycott of Qatar. Initially pirating the feed of Qatar’s beIN Media Group, the owner of beIN Sports and the film studio Miramax, and taking the name beoutQ, it was seen as proof that Saudi Arabia was directly targeting its neighbour.In February, beIN Media, which has 55 million pay-TV customers worldwide, decided against renewing its five-year contract with Formula One saying that the impact of the piracy meant it had to look hard at which TV rights it could afford. It has spent billions on rights content including the Premier League, Champions League, World Cup, NBA and NFL."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8800782287458cbc0cc3b258f04671b06b465a70/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a49e66ee70820d279abf08520660bb0","title":"amazon 25 powerful jeff bezos podcast","story":"In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, the company that has since made him the richest man in the world.

While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

There are, however, three slight issues with this. First, it’s not clear how well the strategy works, second, the word actually means something slightly different, and that definition is not particularly flattering.Let’s start with how Boris Johnson’s team appear to view it: as, essentially, an economic credo, to be laid down in the autumn budget, of spending heavily on infrastructure while also cutting taxes.As such it combines fiscal stimulus – putting “rocket boosters” under the economy, as No 10 insiders have reportedly briefed – with a more nebulous attempt to gee up confidence in growth, similar to Johnson’s simultaneous attempt to increase optimism about Brexit.Economically, this sounds like a philosophy with a longer and fairly chequered history: Reaganomics.As US president, Ronald Reagan boosted growth with his combination of tax cuts and extra spending, but also saw public debt soar, and inequality widen, as the promised “trickle down” effect of tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy failed to materialise.The secondary element of the Johnson definition – talking up the economy – is at least closer to the accepted historical use of the word, though again the connotations are by no means always a compliment.In North American usage, “boosterism” is the heavy promotion of a place, or person, with a hint of hyperbole, even huckster-ish tendencies.In America it has been most associated with efforts to support small towns through new buildings, infrastructure or gimmicks. Historically it has been linked to attempts to inflate local property prices, perhaps excessively so, tempting unwary investors.These days it is often associated more with breakneck gentrification, a similar process except the new money, gimmicks and suddenly unaffordable property prices are intended to revitalise a once-prosperous area.Recent pre-Johnson uses of the term by the  have tended to focus on this sense of talking up a place or project perhaps beyond the realms of realism. One 2017 editorial managed to have its linguistic cake and eat it by using boosterism to describe Elon Musk’s over-promotion of his planned space projects.Perhaps the most famous, and fundamental, use of the word is less favourable still – in Babbitt, the popular if idiosyncratic 1922 satirical novel by writer and social reformer Sinclair Lewis.George F Babbitt, the eponymous protagonist, is a real estate salesman in the fictional midwest city of Zenith, where trade is bolstered by the city’s creed of boosterism – talking up its virtues to increase local fortunes. Such was the novel’s initial influence that for a period “Babbittry” was used as US slang for a sort of over-inflated sales pitch.Babbitt proudly wears a badge proclaiming his membership of the local Boosters’ Club, a sort of masonic lodge meets chamber of commerce, around which much of his business and social life revolved.The novel describes his disaffection with this cosy, bourgeois life. Babbitt initially preaches conventional morality, but then begins an affair.Eventually, and this could, arguably, be the point where the modern connection is broken, he has a crisis of confidence and resumes his conventional life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/789ff5d03943d5c5550961e09c611452fa39d70d/683_130_2573_1543/master/2573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=305b46d318098c8633e660928736a5e0","title":"wed be off our rockers not to back remain in poll says thornberry","story":"Labour’s Emily Thornberry’s comments in Australia put her at odds with Jeremy CorbynLabour’s Emily Thornberry has said the party would be “off our bloody rockers” not to seize the chance to remain in the EU via a second referendum, in an interview which put her at odds with comments from Jeremy Corbyn over the weekend.Speaking in Australia, the shadow foreign secretary said all her meetings in the country had underlined how much better off the UK would be inside the EU.“People that I’ve spoken to here appreciate that, and I have to say practically all of them … have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the European Union, we should take it. Because if we don’t, we’re off our bloody rockers,” she said.On Sunday Corbyn said Labour would campaign for a second referendum and to remain in the EU if Johnson was proposing a no-deal Brexit but said the party would “reopen talks with the EU” about a Brexit deal if it won an election.Asked personally whether he would prefer to remain in the EU or to leave with a Labour-backed deal, Corbyn declined to make a choice. “Investment, jobs, trade and equality, both in or out of the EU. I want those things,” he said.“What we proposed was actually a very credible deal. A bespoke customs union with the EU and the trade arrangements would have achieved those things. It didn’t go through parliament, that was the problem.”Speaking to Sky News Australia’s Graham Richardson, Thornberry said a second referendum should apply to “any deal, or no deal, or whatever this government comes up with”.She added: “It should be put back to the British people so they can be asked: is this what you voted for? Because if you did, that’s fine. But we don’t think it is what you voted for.“I’m firmly of the view that Labour’s policy should be that whatever deal a government comes up with – no ifs, no buts, as Boris Johnson says – we should put it back to the people, we should have another referendum, and that Labour should campaign to remain.“When I’ve been talking to people here in Australia … what’s really come home to me is that one of the reasons for the increased success of the Australian economy … is that you increased your trade with your closest neighbours, and yet in Britain what we’re doing is walking away from our closest neighbours and our biggest trading allies.”This year Corbyn firmly committed the party to backing a referendum on no deal or a Tory Brexit deal, but went further after the EU elections, saying that if a future Labour government were to negotiate a Brexit deal, that would be put to a referendum too.The party’s current position is to back remain over no deal or any Tory-brokered deal, but Corbyn has left open the option of Labour backing leave in a referendum on a deal negotiated by a Labour government – or potentially remaining neutral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ddb2be353d27d291a20fc1c522ab91c766318dd/0_119_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=496735bf62fd54d5a3935561f01cfd41","title":"government urged to scrap nasty two child limit on benefits","story":"Figures show nearly 600,000 children are adversely affected by policyCampaigners have called for the government to scrap the “nasty” two-child limit on benefits after the latest official figures showed that nearly 600,000 children were affected by the controversial policy.The limit means restricts the child allowance in universal credit and tax credits – worth £2,780 a year – is only paid for the first two children in a family. It does not affect children born before April 2017.Ministers promoted the policy as a way to make households take responsibility, by teaching them that “children cost money” and discouraging them from having a third child.Research published earlier this year found nearly all families affected by the limit – which leaves them £53 a week worse off – had cut back on essentials such as food, medication, heating, clothing, as well as after-school clubs. Some parents said they had considered having terminations when they discovered the policy after getting pregnant.Alison Garnham, of the Chid Poverty Action Group (CPAG), said: “Every child deserves a good start in life, but today’s figures are a grim reminder of the human cost of this nasty policy, which says that some children are more deserving than others purely on the basis of their birth order – and which mostly affects working families.“In the UK we would never turn a third-born child away from school or hospital. How can it be right to deny the same young children the support they need to enjoy a childhood free from poverty when their family falls on hard times?”There is concern that the policy will exacerbate a dramatic rise in families with at least three children moving into poverty since 2014 – a nine percentage point increase that is yet to take into account the effect of the two-child policy. According to the CPAG, it will plunge about 300,000 more families into poverty by 2024, by which time 1.8m children will be affected.In a letter to the Times on Wednesday, 109 social policy academics said the policy was “quite simply one of the most damaging changes to the social security system ever”. It had delivered “unprecedented cuts to the living standards of the poorest children in Britain”.The Scottish National party MP Alison Thewliss said: “Across the UK, the majority of those who have been affected by the two-child limit are in work and receiving low income, highlighting the inaccuracy of the UK government’s position of pitting working people against those on benefits.”A government spokesperson said: “This policy ensures fairness by asking families receiving benefits to face the same financial choices as families supporting themselves solely through work. Safeguards are in place and we’ve made changes this year to make the policy fairer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a30022168b1bb2e0ac807f8c56bd9ae079ce43d6/71_3_4655_2794/master/4655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e577c2b38e4493ea1bf23dbf5422e934","title":"pregnant women one to one midwives home birth service closes","story":"About 1,700 women affected after One to One Midwives succumbs to financial difficultiesAbout 1,700 pregnant women, some due to give birth within weeks, will need to find new midwives after a maternity care service was forced to close because of financial difficulties.One to One Midwives announced it was withdrawing the services it provided for the NHS and will enter insolvency proceedings.The company, which provides midwifery services to women in Essex and the north-west of England, said the contracts did not pay enough to make the service financially sustainable.The patients were told on Monday they would need to find an alternative NHS service. Women who were drawn to the service because of its specialism in home births may now have to give birth in hospitals.Elle Torry, 39, a music tutor and advanced hypnotherapist, said she was shocked to hear the service was closing and the midwives would be losing their jobs. Torry said she has been left with uncertainty with just four weeks to go to her due date. “It puts me in a difficult position because we planned to have a home birth and now I have to decide whether to go to the hospital.”She said the service was like the TV programme Call the Midwife, adding that she loved the bond she was able to build with her midwife. “You don’t get that level of care in a hospital. I think having this community-le d team is vital for women’s emotional wellbeing, to just be able to pick up the phone and ask ‘is this ok?’”As well as the midwives losing their jobs, Torry said she was concerned for first time mothers and any woman who had experienced a traumatic birth.Karen Hagan, 49, who has worked as a midwife for One to One for two and a half years, said: “It’s not what you get into midwifery to do, phone women and tell them you can’t support them any more.”Hagan said she received an email about the closure of the service on Monday and the news quickly spread on social media. She said her clients have largely responded in shock.The collapse of One to One follows the closure of Neighbourhood Midwives, which provided midwifery services to women in the south-east, in January.A midwifery lead at One to One, who wished to remain anonymous, said the company struggled to keep up with certain charges they had to pay to the NHS, including fees to refer an expectant mother for certain hospital appointments. “Despite trying to make changes to the way in which the provider-to-provider payments work for our upcoming contract, there has been no willingness to assist us – which has led to our demise,” she said.Alex Lee, 34, who used the One to One when giving birth to her son 15 months ago, said she was devastated to learn the service was closing. “It’s just such a tragedy for so many women to not be able to have this. It’s freedom of choice, quality of care that has been taken away from us.”A spokeswoman for One to One said it was proud of the service it has provided over the last nine years, but the “challenging NHS landscape” had left it with little choice but to close.A spokesperson for the NHS Wirral Clinical Commissioning Group said their “priority” was to ensure women affected by the closure could access the support they needed.“Local commissioners have been working with One to One for some time and have been having an on-going dialogue to provide as much support as possible. One to One have been paid according to nationally agreed tariffs. The decision to go into administration has been taken by One to One,” the spokesperson added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b419dcc11ec9d4537895b129ab91498b560d1765/0_111_4126_2476/master/4126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6336e1bd4f3bd0c281400154ddaa6993","title":"charley hull womens british open golf","story":"The golfer will not let the prospect of a major win at home consume her as the Open returns to WoburnThree years ago, Charley Hull’s destiny appeared clear. She spent months driving to Woburn, past a giant poster of herself, for twice-weekly practice sessions as the Women’s British Open honed into view. At Hull’s home club, the sense prevailed that this golden child of British golf was primed for major glory.A tie for 17th in 2016 was hardly a disastrous finish but it fell way short of expectations, primarily her own. From the same generation, it was Georgia Hall who tasted major success first, in the British Open of 12 months ago. Neither is Hull the top-ranked British player in the world rankings, a position claimed by Bronte Law.It was little surprise, then, to hear Hull play down the significance of this major’s Woburn return. The backdrop will be serene when she tees of shortly after 7.30am on Thursday morning, just the way she wants it.“I’ve not been here as much. In fact, I took Monday off and didn’t come down, and I’m only playing nine holes today. I’m just trying to get my work done and go back to the hotel. I like the way they’ve set the golf course this year. They’ve actually set it up a lot longer than last time, which is nice.”Hull admitted Hall’s success “made me work harder” but denied any element of professional jealousy. The pair are friends. Hull is open about a desire to win a major but the concept will not consume her.“It would be great,” she said. “But I’m just going to go out there and enjoy it. I’d love to win a major, especially on home turf, I think it would be great. But I’m just going to go out there and enjoy it and the more I enjoy it, hopefully it gives me a chance to win out there.“I can’t put too much pressure on myself in golf because sometimes I feel like I do actually. I would really love to win this event, especially on home turf but again, I’m not going to say it’s my be-all and end-all because I don’t want to put pressure on myself.”Hull has recovered from a bout of food poisoning that affected her performance at last week’s Evian Championship. Lexi Thompson left her passport in her golf bag when exiting that event, causing a delay to the arrival in England for 40 players’ equipment. Thompson’s luggage had to be traced in a van which was carrying multiple sets of clubs.“I didn’t realise that I was going to cause so much delay in the bags for all the players, and I’m very sorry about that,” Thompson said. “I would be upset, too, if I was the other players. I can’t apologise enough.”Another awkward moment arrived on Wednesday when Royal Porthcawl was confirmed as the Women’s Open venue in 2021. While clearly excited, the club’s captain Rhys James insisted this could be a precursor for the men’s equivalent heading to Wales.“The club is certainly interested in the potential for bringing the Open to Royal Porthcawl,” he said. “I think we all saw what a massive success the activities at Portrush have been in the last 10 days and I think working closely with the R\u0026ampA, with the Welsh government and other related organisations, it is certainly something that we would like to consider.”This was news to the R\u0026ampA’s Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, who from two seats away landed a knockout blow Andy Ruiz Jr would have been proud of. “We have no plans to take the Open Championship to Royal Porthcawl,” he said. “They’ve hosted the Senior Open, they’re about to host the Women’s British Open. But currently the Open Championship is not in the discussions. We’re very happy with the 10 venues we have at the moment.” Ouch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ef89128de32d52529c987f34b334665ea3c1e2e/0_227_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1958cd8b081405b0d7033b5c96320ed","title":"david gower leaving sky ashes cricket","story":"The news that David Gower will be laying down his microphone – or, rather, unclipping the lapel mic from whatever elegant silk tie he happens to be wearing that day – caused a murmur of sadness in my family. He had retired from international cricket when I started watching the game, so my memories of him were never those of the golden-haired boy of summer. His batting was already being embalmed in nostalgia, a mosquito trapped in amber, its wings spread in an eternally stylish cover drive.But he had quickly become the honeyed voice of cricket, his oh so slightly crooked smile so regular a part of my life that it was soon entwined with the seasons. As the Bible almost put it: “The winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth … and the voice of David Gower is heard in our land.” He was also my mother’s long-term cricket crush, beloved to the extent that a framed picture of him sat proudly on her office desk at her law firm, alongside the much smaller photos of her husband and children.Gower is, in his own words, “being retired”. Sky Sports has not renewed his contract, and this Ashes series will be his last gig. He did not appear as one of the ICC’s World Cup commentators, so his voice has felt strangely lacking from England’s history-making moment. He has spoken of this unexpected ending with a candour that made it hard not to overanalyse his performance in the Ireland Test last week. Was his delivery lacking a little of its usual joyfulness, or did he just have a cold? Was that panama hat he was wearing some kind of silent call to arms, or a sign of demob happiness?There are those who would argue his almost careless tone no longer fits with the Sky brand, and perhaps they are right. Gower graduated from the Richie Benaud school of commentary, relaxed enough to let the pictures speak for themselves. He didn’t try to adorn every image with his thoughts, a reserve that more garrulous former players struggle to appreciate (yes, I’m looking at you, Rob Key). Understated responses were often a part of his charm. A purred “wow” from beneath those white-gold curls could cover anything from a nice cover drive to a record-breaking innings from Brian Lara.The attributes that defined his playing persona – deftness, nonchalance – were always best purposed as an anchor. Gower was the smooth talker, welcoming you to the start of play like a white-suited captain greeting you on board his cruise ship. Taking you into lunch like a walker negotiating an elderly aristocrat around the dance floor, the charm written across his face no less sincere because it was being paid for it.But the place Gower established, among a TV lineage that stretched from Peter West and Tony Lewis to Benaud and beyond, wasn’t only down to his ability to transmit a twinkle directly through the cathode rays. There has always been a palpable kindness that makes the viewer feel safe in his hands, invited into a sport that can be – especially to the uninitiated – a little intimidating. And, of course, an ability to laugh at himself that made him such a delightful foil for Lee Hurst, Rory McGrath and Nick Hancock on They Think It’s All Over, long before A League of Their Own came along.His departure from Sky is part of a wider (and not unwelcome) remodelling of its coverage. Sir Ian Botham is also expected to leave, and spend more time with his wine collection. Bob Willis seems to have been put out to the permanent pasture of the Cricket Debate show, where his dour intonation can’t unintentionally bring down the mood. The Sky box has never felt like a locker room but it did, for a long while, resemble a club lounge for England captains with frequent flyer miles. A recent spruce has given it a more contemporary feel. Isa Guha – who served her apprenticeship, it should be noted, at ITV, ESPN and the BBC – has looked a smart signing ever since she became Sky’s first woman to commentate on men’s matches.Elements that have always been excellent – the deep es emerging from the third man’s chair, the use of innovative technology – are central to Sky’s offering, and the banter about where everyone ate last night has given way to ever more surgical analysis. Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton, who would easily make an all-time XI of cricket commentators (though they may have to cede the captaincy to Benaud), spot details so minute yet telling it must be tempting to give them their own spin-off crime investigation show.Their stock only rose during the World Cup, where the ICC’s feed reminded us of the disparity among their collation of on-screen talent. At one end, you had Kumar Sangakkara, Mel Jones and Ian Smith – at the other, Ramiz Raja attempting a pitch report while behaving like someone who has just landed on its surface from Saturn. Whatever you think of so much cricket being hidden behind a paywall, you can’t dispute that Sky’s commentary team offers value for money.Still, as analysis becomes ever more acute and technical, it’s worth remembering that the serious business of uncovering the nuances of sport can make it appear ever more complicated to those on the outside. With cricket returning to the BBC next year, and the Hundred attempting to draw new viewers, the ability to engage them easily will be crucial.Just as Clare Balding and Hazel Irvine can walk and talk us through Olympic sports we’ve never before encountered – without making us feel like we’re outsiders, or worse, too stupid to be there – we still need those who can extend a beneficent invitation to a cricketing world we don’t yet know. And that has always been part of Gower’s charm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8c1f1e195df4b9804d4a412e2ad3bcba9e1b419/95_133_3099_1859/master/3099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f82bc3651c0f8d19cf460e9cc39cb75b","title":"fuss over joe roots move to no 3 is just another part of ashes mythology","story":"There are the usual signs that it is getting closer. The Ashes white noise starts to fade. The Ashes hum starts to die back, wider current of Ashes anxiety to fall away. And suddenly Test cricket begins to pare itself back to the basic, atomic level business of Australian bowlers against English batsmen, Baggy Green in the field against starchy whites at the wicket. Look back and cricket’s oldest two‑hander has so often pegged itself out this way. Hence, perhaps, the strikingly emotive response to Joe Root’s announcement that he will move up one space to bat No 3 for England in Thursday’s first Test at Edgbaston.It is the smallest of changes, the kind of tweak that might pass unremarked in any other less‑storied sport. But this is not any other sport and Root to three is a shift of England’s own supporting architecture, a pre-series riposte to Australia’s greatest strength, and a move that may well define how the start of this series plays out.Beyond this it is a change that twangs away one of the big fat major chords of cricket’s most relentlessly self-mythologising contest. An England captain at No 3 a potent Aussie pace attack five clear Ashes Tests stretching away over the dog days of late summer. This is a kind of sporting perfection.Forget the No 3 slot, which is a largely an Australia-based obsession. This is a country where first drop is another of those sporting details to be tearfully fetishised, another holy relic in a place where strong, noble outdoorsy men perform valiant, nation-defining feats in the middle of all that clear-blue Australian heat, in the land of the rapidly softening new ball.The importance of English batting against Australian bowling is wider than this: not just a defining contest in most Ashes series, but a dynamic that cuts across the basics of the sport and of the relations between these two nations, at least in the inflamed sporting imagination.In cricket’s class structure, batsmen have always been gentlemen and bowlers the players, the workers, agricultural hands there to provide the staging for their elegantly swiping lordships. In this view of cricket bowlers are revolutionaries too, Bolsheviks inverting the class system, the only person on the pitch allowed to strike, bloody, tear down and generally overthrow their opponent, to question their basic pluck and courage.When David Warner said he saw fear in the eyes of England’s No 3 at the Gabba six years ago this was more than simply shithousery. It was cultural shithousery, something buried in the deep Australian sporting soul, the voice not only of one crowing Australian, but of those that crowed before him, the noble dead, stretching right back through these generational collisions.In an interesting twist the two series the English tend to remember, the Bodyline tour and the 2005 Ashes, were thrilling inversions of this dynamic, with English fast bowlers mimicking Australian aggression. Either side there is a history of English resistance to Australian fire, from Hobbs and Sutcliffe putting on 105 on a Melbourne sticky, watched by a captivated Don Bradman, and discussed in print 60 years later by Richie Benaud (one of the most holy Australian moments in all Australian cricketdom, a vast groaning six‑tier cake of Baggie Green goodness) through to Lillee and Thomson and their gleefully punkish acts of high-speed vandalism against a particularly baleful and doomed England order.Ever since, the fate of most Ashes series has been defined by England’s ability to resist this force: from Warne, McGrath and Lee, to Harris and Johnson and now to Cummins, Starc and Pattinson.And so back to Root and to No 3. There has been a degree of weary harrumphing at his unwillingness to move up the order. It is an easy point to make. What’s one spot? What relevance could three or four have when the real variables are pitches and bowlers and shine on the ball? What difference does it make when England have been opening the batting with a series of interchangeable polystyrene tailors’ mannequins for the past three years?But Root is right. History suggests this is not a decision to be taken lightly and not only because his own batting numbers say so. Root averages 53 in the middle order and 40 in the top three. He averages 28 in his past 11 innings at No 3. Clearly something is going on here.Like any self-respecting, neurotically obsessive world-class top-order batsmen Root is right to focus on the details. This could be a defining series for England’s captain, in a format and a contest where so often how a player feels, the idea of being settled, of being able to channel your energy the right way, has made such a difference.Top-order Test batting is a complex business, a matter of angles and pressure, just as in England the job of a No 3 is different, less about walking out and leading from the front, more about defence and protection and adaptability not least in this England order that packs all its power towards the lower-middle end.There are two other key points about that move and about the need for Root to be sure. First, it is striking just how much better he is than everyone else in England’s batting. Nobody else in that top eight averages anywhere near 40, bar Jason Roy’s one-Test effort. Root averages 49. Second, and related, history suggest the feats of one England batsmen can define a series.It is clearly vital in these circumstances for Root to be sure of the fine detail of his role. The spectacle of one English batsman leading the way has been a theme from David Gower’s majestic floppy‑hatted brutality at No 3 in 1985 to three hundreds in the series for Chris Broad opening in 1986‑87 to Ian Bell’s wonderful stand-alone hundreds at Trent Bridge, Lord’s and Chester Le-Street at No 5 in 2013.This time around, England’s batting is power-packed but undeniably brittle, part of the wider tide of first-class cricket around the world. The Test team has given a debut to six top-order batsmen in the past two years. None has yet made a hundred. None of the top-six batsmen England have tried since Root made his debut seven years ago has managed to average 40.The default opener Rory Burns has spent time this week at Surrey with Neil Stewart, his youth team coach, working on the basics of batting and a technique that when it goes, really goes. Alongside him Jason Roy will attack every time, even if attacking is only selectively the right thing to do. England have the capacity to fall apart like an overly dunked digestive biscuit against a fine, high-pace Aussie attack.Pat Cummins has 94 Test wickets at 22, James Pattinson 64 at 26. They have one possible weakness. They have played two Tests in England between them. They will face in Root a No 3 who averages 54 at home who has 11 hundreds in 43 Tests in England and who must feel there is an edge to be seized or lost by thrusting himself forward to meet the challenge. History suggests he may just be right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee96540b1f8536a4af4a95cbdf81127877a95bfc/0_357_4607_2765/master/4607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=681fb41e04157eec8d82feb9bb4c593f","title":"womens ashes england v australia third final t20 live cricket","story":"1st over: England 6-0 (Wyatt 1, Beaumont 3) Ellyse Perry’s first over is a bit of a mixed bag. There’s a leg-side wide to Wyatt, who is also beaten by a beauty outside off stump. Beaumont then drags a short ball towards mid-on, where the sprawling Vlaeminck does very well to save a couple of runs.England have, as we suspected, made a change to their batting order: Tammy Beaumont will open with Danni Wyatt.It’s a beautiful evening in Bristol. The players are ready, the umpires are ready. Let us flay.Amy Jones is listed to open for England, but she may drop down the order after a miserable time in the white-ball matches. She has made five runs in five innings, with four ducks, although she made a superb 64 on Test debut before this IT20 series.The young bowling allrounder Mady Villiers makes her England debut, while Australia bring in the fast bowler Tayla Vlaeminck.“We want to finish off on a high,” says Meg Lanning. “We need three hours of hard work tonight and we’re looking forward to it.”Here’s Geoff Lemon on the great Meg Lanning, who has scored 388 runs against England in IT20s since she was last dismissed. And even that was a run out.Good evening. The good news for England is that the torment is almost over. The bad news is that there isn’t enough Aloe Vera in the world to heal the scars caused by Australia’s pitiless excellence this summer. This has been a traumatic thrashing for England the kind that, if you’re not careful, bleeds into the next Ashes series, and the next, and the next, until one day you start dining out on the fact you once beat Ellyse Perry’s outside edge.A win tonight would give Australia a 14-2 series victory, which would be a record since the points system was introduced in 2013. (England won 12-4 that year.) England have avoided defeat only once, in the one-off Test match, and they were second best in that game as well.Their Ashes horribilis has prompted the kind of soul-searching and domestic-structure-bemoaning this country does so readily. England can play better - there’s your daily insight, folks! - but they are still the second best team in the world. For mine, this Ashes has been more about Australia’s strengths than their weaknesses. On reflection it was naive to think England had much of a chance. They are playing against the greatest team in women’s cricket history. But I doubt England will draw much succour from that.The match begins at 6.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6925f995f42bfc9a63f3047d109847f7578da7f/0_123_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1086af31498800269a4149944fea976c","title":"oona doherty choreographer hard to be soft edinburgh festival dance umbrella","story":"The Northern-Irish choreographer’s raw and powerful work examines gender, identity and religion, but it all happens by accident, she says.Oona Doherty is finding out about the law of unintended media consequences. Hard to Be Soft: A Belfast Prayer, the work that has defined her young choreographic career, grew out of a solo she made in 2016. Since then, however, the conversation around Northern Ireland has changed, and Doherty isn’t exactly disposed to be a spokeswoman. “Now it tours all the time and everyone keeps asking: ‘tell me about your life history in Belfast what do you think about Brexit?’” she says. “I’m really afraid of people buying the show and going like: oh, poor Belfast! Let’s go see this wee play about Belfast before they float off into the …”I absurdly feel the need to apologise. “No, you’re OK,” she adds laconically. If this sentence counts as high praise from anyone, it’s Doherty. The 33-year-old choreographer doesn’t do pretence, either in performance or off stage. When I ask her frequent collaborator the Belfast-born composer David Holmes about her, he uses the word “raw” three times.That visceral honesty has set her apart in a sea of highly curated contemporary dance brands. Doherty has a rare ability to connect a gesture with the web of emotions that sustain it. In Hard to Be Soft, her hair tucked away in a small bun, she re-creates the muscle memory and social performance of masculinity with complete empathy – and choreographs it for others, too, including a moving father-son duo. The production is heading to the Edinburgh festival and London’s Dance Umbrella this year .She is a rarity among artists, a ball of no-nonsense candour and intuition, who seems physically allergic to affectation. A few days earlier, I had watched a visibly tired Doherty, still reeling from the premiere of her latest work, Lady Magma, deliver one-sentence answers on a panel at the European festival Aerowaves. When asked about her influences, she replied: “I don’t really watch dance.” (Not entirely true, for the record.)She is rested and more expansive when we sit down, but immediately points out that her gender-bending exploration of masculine tropes in Hard to Be Soft as well as 2016’s Hope Hunt came about by accident. The parts she dances in both were created for male friends: she only took over when they got other jobs. “I had never read or looked at anything to do with gender before people started asking me: how did you come to make a gender piece?”Hard to Be Soft also involves a group of powerful teenage girls, the Sugar Army, who are recruited locally in every city and defy “feminine” expectations (without forgoing lipstick, at least in Paris). Doherty has a dream for her international Sugar Armies: to bring them together for a dance protest in front of Stormont.Holmes calls her “a sponge”. “Oona is constantly making it up as she’s going along, listening, absorbing, almost creating on the spot. What she does is really sophisticated, but it’s also completely from the street, so it’s got this real guttural realism to it.”Growing up in Belfast, Doherty was a self-avowed tomboy. Her Northern Irish mother moved the family there from London when she was 10 she and her brother got in trouble for their accents. She started dancing at an after-school club, taking part in her Catholic school’s musicals: “We weren’t allowed to do Cats. I think it was too sexy for the nuns.”Still, religion seeped into her imagination. She once described Hard to Be Soft as a “neon bright prayer”, its design has a church-like feel to it, with light filtering from above. In primary school, Doherty thought she might become a nun herself. When her mother stopped going to mass because it was “too depressing”, she went alone to apologise to God for her family’s absence.She over-corrected in some ways as a young adult, getting kicked out of the London Contemporary Dance School after being beset by feelings of inadequacy. “I started acting up, going out with this crazy Sardinian DJ, partying, spending my student loan. That was to do with my ego,” she says. “But it was the best thing that ever happened to me, because then I worked as a waitress, and for the first time in my life, I really missed dancing.”After completing degrees at Ulster University and Laban, Doherty spent four years with T.r.a.s.h, a now defunct Dutch company known for extreme, punk-style experimentation. In 2014, she gravitated back to Northern Ireland. “I was drinking and drugging up too much, I had to go home,” she says frankly. She has no regrets. “When I’m working, it helps me to remember what it felt like to be really deep in a ketamine hole, to be like: oh, too much coke. All of that can come back into use in the nervous system to make physical states.”Bangor, the Belfast suburb where her family lives and where Doherty can go on long runs by the sea, has the opposite, grounding effect. She is fiercely protective of her roots. “I’m really serious about myself, and a pain in the ass sometimes. That’s why I like Belfast: it keeps you normal. The artists are amazing, but they don’t let you be an idiot.” At the Atelier de Paris in April, she also unveiled a new work, Lady Magma. This 70s-flavoured, slightly chaotic “ritual”, another collaboration with Holmes, was born out of an exercise of breathing and release, and reads like a no-holds-barred exploration of female pleasure. “When you practise really opening a muscle, and really releasing it, that’s the most simple version of how you can actually let go of shit,” Doherty says, adding that it has led to soul-searching about her own body. “When you’re having sex, sometimes it’s hard to truly release into your own pleasure, because you hold a bit of tension. You’re aware, even if you’re trying to not be aware, of what you look like.”For the first time, Doherty isn’t on stage in Lady Magma, although she climbed on a bench in the hall of the theatre before the premiere to lead the audience in breathing exercises. “What are you looking for today?” she asked one woman near her. “Emotion,” came the reply, and some of Doherty’s own stress seemed to ebb away as she nodded. She still has her doubts about her ability as a choreographer. “I haven’t had a show yet that has played and done well without me being in it,” she says. “Maybe I’m just really good at dancing.”The paucity of arts funding in Northern Ireland means there is no guarantee where support will come from for her next projects. Not that Doherty is about to wallow in self-pity. “I’ve had quite an easy life, you know, compared to a lot of people. Geez! I’m a white girl doing contemporary dance! It can’t get much easier.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfa5586906b62620f1cc35eb9a194ca113e17d93/390_567_2252_1351/master/2252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0a4b72103074f5c37f07e9a5f1c883","title":"swallows and amazons review york theatre royal","story":"York Theatre RoyalSongs and music by the Divine Comedy’s Neil Hannon sparkle in this vivid adaptation of Arthur Ransome’s classic that might please adults more than kidsSummer holidays are made for adventures. And Arthur Ransome’s tale of Lake District escapades, adapted for the stage by Helen Edmundson, has the ingredients of all the best children’s adventure stories: vivid imaginations, space in which to roam, and a virtual absence of adults (or, as the Swallows dub them, barbarians).Left to their own devices, the four Walker children set sail in their beloved boat Swallow, exploring the waters and islands of the nearby lake. It’s not long before they run into sisters Nancy and Peggy – the Amazons – and all-out war is declared between the young swashbucklers.The York Theatre Royal’s take on this well-known story, directed by Damian Cruden and John R Wilkinson, is packed with charm. Adults playing children – so often an occasion for cringing – is pulled off by a uniformly excellent cast. Their travels take them all over Katie Sykes’s flexible set, which conjures both the magnificence of the landscape and the intensity of the children’s imaginations.But the real highlight is the soundtrack, composed by the Divine Comedy’s Neil Hannon. Played on stage by the actors, the music is full of complex harmonies and playful rhymes, with lyrics that trigger snorts of laughter from the audience. In one particularly memorable example, “duckling takes to water” is startlingly paired with “mindless slaughter”. In the stretches between songs, though, the storytelling can drag a little. At almost two and a half hours, this is a long show for its young target audience, testing attention s. In some ways, for all the silliness, it feels as if it’s more for adults than for children – drenching big kids in nostalgia for those long, adventure-filled summer days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f4284f3a7cea4b823b2267be1820fb4648b39/1181_1041_3639_2184/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e282be98d954c046b234a79e2ded070","title":"deafness its part of who you are one mans journey to inspire","story":"Ed Rex has enjoyed some memorable travel experiences over the years. He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Much of it will end up in landfill – an estimated 10,000 items of clothing are sent there every five minutes in the UK. Textile recycling is still in its infancy (recyclenow, for local fabric banks) but buying swimwear made from recycled plastic waste helps ert it from landfill and saves on raw materials and energy used in virgin fabric production.The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) recommends using marine-safe sunscreen for holidays, wherever you are, as certain chemicals can harm marine life, including creatures found in UK waters, it says.“Unfortunately sunscreens have been shown to have an impact on the marine environment – not just coral reefs but also other marine organisms,” the MCS said. “Oxybenzone and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (octinoxate) are particularly harmful, and MCS recommends avoiding sunscreens with these ingredients.”Bans on sunscreen containing these chemicals are planned in Palau island in the Pacific (from 2020), Hawaii (2021), and Key West in Florida (2021), and although they are not outlawed in Mexico, many cenotes and other tourist destinations ask visitors not to use them. Sunscreen is categorised as chemical (absorbs UV rays) or mineral (creates a layer on top of the skin to deflect them). Chemical ones often require less-frequent application and, unlike some mineral ones, don’t leave a white cast on the skin. Boots says its Soltan suncream (from £3.50) contains neither oxybenzone nor octinoxate, because it sources “ingredients that protect environments across the globe”.W R Yuma 3D-prints its sunglasses from recycled plastic found on the banks of waterways around Antwerp. It and partner company Stormkop work with local children to collect and clean waste for creative projects, aiming to help change perspectives on the value of waste material. Some of the plastic is then shredded and melted into 3D printing filament (ink), and used to print glasses (from £115).Handcrafted from sustainable bamboo, Wear Panda sunglasses (from £69) have low environmental impact compared with most plastic shades. Bamboo is durable, renewable and relatively easy to grow, without needing pesticides or fertilisers. The company also works with Optometry Giving Sight, and for every pair it sells, someone without access to eye care will receive a medical eye examination and a free pair of prescription glasses.Another one-for-one initiative comes from Wildwood, which plants a tree for every pair of sunglasses sold, to help combat deforestation. Each pair of handmade sunglasses, with carved wooden frames (from £69), is named after an endangered species and comes in a natural bamboo case.Created from Planwood, an eco-material made from waste-sustainable rubberwood sawdust from its factory, and coloured with organic pigments, the PlanToys sand playset (£29.99, Babipur) includes a bucket and three fish-shaped spades. All its toys come in recycled, non-toxic packaging.“Changing the world one bubble at a time,” Dr Zigs has created a giant bubble kit (£19.99) that includes wooden wands from sustainable sources, untreated cotton ropes and non-toxic bubble mix.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

So why do many people assume it’s only for homeowners with families?Kicking the bucket. Cashing in your chips. Going for a Burton. Heading to the great gig in the sky. Whatever you like to call it, death is a daunting subject few of us are fond of talking about. Our profound discomfort when it comes to discussing the “destination we all share” (Steve Jobs) also means we procrastinate or avoid things that focus on it.Take life insurance. Many of us would feel hugely reassured knowing that, should we pass on, loved ones would be financially secure, even enjoying the same living standards as they did before. Yet, our unwillingness to broach our departures (spoiler alert: it will happen) also means there are some widely held misconceptions about life insurance. Here, the  and Aviva embark on a debunking mission to separate fact from fiction …Myth 1: Life insurance is only for homeownersOne of the few things people know about life insurance is that many policies pay out enough cash for your loved ones to settle the remainder of your mortgage when you pass away, meaning your partner andor dependents needn’t fret about meeting monthly repayments.Myth 2: We don’t have any kids, ergo we don’t need life insuranceIt’s natural that child-free couples might question the importance of life cover. After all, many insurance policies are geared around ensuring families are looked after once the breadwinner has passed away. But taking up a policy can help, particularly if you have any mortgage debt that you don’t want to saddle your partner with.Myth 4: Life insurance is expensiveWrong! Life insurance costs considerably less than most people think. At Aviva, you can take up life insurance from just £5 a month.There’s good news for clean-living fitness freaks, too. As the cost of life insurance is linked to your state of health, if you’re in good shape (translation: don’t smoke like a chimney or adopt a diet that leads to future coronaries), your quote will reflect that.Myth 5: I’ll be drowning in paperworkGetting life insurance today can take as little as five minutes online. And don’t worry about insurance professionals digging into your personal life by asking questions about your dangerous base-jumping hobby either. At Aviva, it could take as few as five simple questions before you’re covered.As for wading through impenetrable legalese or having to badger your GP for medical records, if more information is required the insurance company can do this for you.Myth 7: I’ll be paying higher premiums because I used to smokeYes, smokers pay more for life insurance.

The driver will have plenty of time to discover it. What’s interesting about the sculpture is that people will not stop and look at it. It will be seen when people are in movement – and they will go through it and away.”The sculpture will be formed of two arcs, of 28 metres and 60 metres in height, emerging from the earth on either side of the highway. About 1,000 tonnes of concrete will be used to keep it in place. “It had to be pure nature inserted with culture,” Venet added of his vision. The artist said that in time there may be two areas to the side of the motorway to allow people to view the structure.Among Britain’s tallest freestanding artworks are the ArcelorMittal Orbit (114.5m) in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London the Aspire tower (60m) at the University of Nottingham’s Jubilee campus and Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North (20m) in Gateshead.The construction of the arc is largely being funded by the John Cockerill Foundation, a philanthropic arm of CMI based in Seraing, Belgium.Venet has been described by Forbes magazine as one of France’s greatest living artists. “I had the idea in 1979 of two arcs on a road,” he said. “I thought it would be wonderful to do that. This is a dream for me.”The artistic vision may be lost on some motorists this summer, however. Until mid-October, only one lane will be open for those coming to Belgium from Luxembourg and the road is to be completely closed to traffic on the evening of the sculpture’s installation.Véronique Sorlet, a spokeswoman for the John Cockerill Foundation, said: “The assembly has several phases including welding the three elements of the great arc.“Then we have to carry out the ad hoc checks and install the ‘dynamic damper’, which reduces the natural vibratory movement.In 2016, Venet built a 20-metre-high arc at a roundabout in Bonn, Germany, entitled ARC ’89, to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall and Germany’s reunification. A temporary 22-metre-high arc by Venet was also installed near the Palace of Versailles in 2011 in the face of some criticism.The Arc Majeur will still be dwarfed in Europe by the Motherland statue at the top of the Museum of the Great Patriotic War in Ukraine, at 102 metres high, and the Sanctuary of Christ the King in Almada, Portugal, which is 110 metres tall.The tallest monument in the world, at 182 metres, is believed to be a statue of India’s first deputy prime minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b93aeadc722261e52a23157b98cb6a48f6dd7054/0_255_2009_1205/master/2009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8903555cff3edb233fe920483bdfd21f","title":"burger king beard ban infringes workers rights says catalonia","story":"Rule that male workers should wear ties and female staff ribbons is discriminatory, officials also sayBurger King workers in Barcelona will be able to lay down their razors after Catalan authorities decided the fast food giant’s prohibition on beards, moustaches and stubble violated employees’ constitutional rights.The regional government’s labour inspection committee also determined that rules stipulating that male workers should wear ties and female workers ribbons amounted to sexual discrimination.The local branch of the Workers’ Commissions union said it asked authorities to step in after Burger King refused to budge on the issue.Burger King employs 1,269 people in 46 restaurants throughout the province of Barcelona, all of whom are subject to the same internal rules.In its ruling the labour inspectors concluded: “As a result of the inspection, it has been established that certain company practices laid out in the internal rules infringe the constitutional rights of workers, namely, the right to one’s own image and the right to equal treatment and against sexual discrimination as set out, respectively, in articles 18.1 and 14 of the Spanish constitution.”They also noted that other “more moderate measures, which do not damage fundamental rights” could be introduced, such as the compulsory use of beard nets.“Burger King’s internal rules – which are pretty reasonable – oblige workers to come to work in a well dressed, decent and hygienic state,” said Carles Català of the Catalan branch of the Workers’ Commissions.“That’s as it should be. But they also oblige me to shave off my beard for food preparation reasons? I found that very odd, so we put in the hands of the labour inspectors, who have pointed out that there are already measures available.”Although the inspectors’ rulings will only apply to those working in the Barcelona area, the union hopes to see national action.“We want this to be applied to all Burger King workers not just those in Barcelona, where we have union representation,” said Català. “For us, it’s an important first step and we’re very keen to try to negotiate things with the company.”Burger King declined to comment on the matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c91f54e7fca89d9f1ef5990377c5e776f10abf9/0_188_3268_1961/master/3268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ab2a588579e50d71bcd006eaaf85861","title":"puerto ricos ousted governor names pedro pierluisi as next leader","story":"Pierluisi is a member of the disgraced leader Ricardo Rosselló’s pro-statehood New Progressive partyPuerto Rico’s ousted governor, Ricardo Rosselló, announced his intended successor on Wednesday morning, two days before the disgraced leader of the US territory is due to resign. He named Pedro Pierluisi as the next head of the island’s government.Pierluisi served as Puerto Rico’s resident commissioner in Washington between 2009 and 2017, and before that was the US territory’s justice secretary. The position of resident commissioner holds a non-voting seat in the US House of Representatives. He is a member of Rosselló’s pro-statehood New Progressive party (PNP) and served as justice secretary under the administration of Pedro Rosselló, the current governor’s father.“After much analysis and taking into account the best interests of our people, I selected the lawyer Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia to fill the vacancy of secretary of state,” Rosselló said in a statement. “I have pondered many options for this position and the huge responsibility involved. This historical moment requires a person capable of restoring relations with all sectors at local and national levels.”Rosselló will convene a special session of Puerto Rico’s legislative assembly on Thursday to seek confirmation of the appointment. The statement indicated Pierluisi would see out the remainder of this term but would not contest next year’s gubernatorial election.The governor announced his resignation last week, following two weeks of continuous mass demonstration on the island in the wake of a leaked text message scandal involving Rosselló and 11 members of his inner circle. The messages contained a slew of homophobic and misogynistic language directed at political rivals and cultural figures. They also contained a joke about dead bodies after Hurricane Maria, which tore through the island in September 2017 leading to a revised official death toll of 2,982.Pierluisi’s confirmation by the PNP-controlled assembly remains far from certain as other factions of the party jostle for prominence in the wake of Rosselló’s departure.The president of Puerto Rico’s senate and acting chair of the PNP, Thomas Rivera Schatz, has indicated he does not support Pierluisi’s nomination, suggesting the nominee is conflicted due to his work as an attorney with a law firm working for the unelected fiscal oversight board. The panel was appointed to oversee the territory’s financial affairs in Washington amid a multibillion-dollar debt crisis. It was created under the Obama administration at the height of the island’s financial collapse.During his resignation speech last Wednesday, Rosselló initially named his justice secretary, Wanda Vázquez, as successor to the governorship. But over the weekend, as protesters continued to take to the streets over the announcement, Vázquez said she was no longer interested in the job.The Rosselló administration has been plagued with corruption and mismanagement scandals since Maria hit the island. Shortly before the text message scandal erupted six former government officials and contractors, including the former education secretary Julia Keleher, were arrested by the FBI over allegations involving the misappropriation of millions of dollars in federal funds.Rosselló’s resignation is due to take effect at 5pm local time on Friday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3972848.1564579043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dial down the rhetoric on brexit foster tells varadkar","story":"DUP leader Arlene Foster has said that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar needs to dial down the rhetoric over Brexit, adding that she believes a Brexit deal can be reached. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t DUP leader Arlene Foster conducts a television interview prior to the arrival of Boris Johnson at Stormont. Photograph:  Charles McQuillanGettyDUP leader Arlene Foster has called on\u0026nbspTaoiseach Leo Varadkar to “dial down the rhetoric” on Brexit after her party met new British prime minister Boris Johnson in Belfast.Ms Foster said a Brexit solution could be found that met the concerns of the European Union and of the British and Irish governments.She was asked was the DUP position now in line with Mr Johnson’s that he wanted the backstop scrapped or was it the previous position of the party that it could live with a time-limit to the backstop. She said: “The prime minister is saying very clearly that he believes the withdrawal agreement is dead and therefore the backstop is dead. We have to find a different way forward, and that is what we will support the prime minister in doing,”“There are ways to deal with this issue if there is a willingness on both sides. I hope that Dublin will dial down the rhetoric and that there will be a willingness to engage with our new prime minister,” she added.Ms Foster also was dismissive of Sinn Féin calls for a referendum on Irish unity. She said, “The prime minister reiterated the fact that he would never be neutral on the union. We welcome that. He will off course be neutral on the administration of government here in Northern Ireland. And talk of a Border poll, he told us, is something that he would never entertain.”Liberal unionistsDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds also was dismissive of Mr Varadkar’s claim that some liberal unionists who opposed Brexit were more seriously considering what unity might mean. Mr Dodds said the conditions for a Border poll were not met and those who were engaging in “hysteria” and “talking it up” were in contravention of the Belfast Agreement.Mr Dodds said Mr Varadkar talking up a Border poll when the conditions for such a referendum were not met were in breach of the agreement. “Let’s get real here. The idea that many unionists would turn around and vote for a united Ireland on the basis of the current developments is something that is not reflected in the reality of people on the ground.”Boris Johnson on his first prime ministerial visit to Northern Ireland has insisted he will act impartially with Northern parties despite taking time on Tuesday night to hold a private dinner with DUP leaders.Mr Johnson arrived in Northern Ireland on Tuesday night when he met the DUP leader Arlene Foster and senior party colleagues Nigel Dodds and Jeffrey Donaldson for dinner.It is understood that among a range of issues they discussed the continuation of the confidence-and-supply agreement whereby the DUP’s 10 MPs vote to keep the British government in power.The Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann, as he led his party delegation in talks with Mr Johnson, said “the optics” of holding the dinner were very poor.” Whoever advised him that it was good timing to have that dinner on the night before he met the other parties, it was not a good decision,” said Mr Swann.Mr Johnson said: “It’s all there in the Good Friday agreement, we believe in complete impartiality and that’s what we’re going to observe.”Sir Jeffrey Donaldson defended the dinner, saying there was nothing unusual about such an engagement.StormontMr Johnson arrived at Stormont around 8.15am and began the series of meeting with the North’s five main parties by meeting Sinn Féin. Before those talks Mr Johnson said he would do everything in his power to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said after her party’s meeting with the prime minister that she told him the “ongoing indulgence of the DUP and rejectionist unionism has got to stop”.“He tells us that he will act with absolute impartiality. We told him nobody believes that,” she said.“We have told him that the confidence-and-supply agreement between the Tories and the DUP poisoned the ground water politically, and made it very, very, very difficult to sustain a negotiation, much less to land on a conclusion or an agreement,” added Ms McDonald.She said, “He asked for our advice. We have strongly advised him that to make progress here he needs to ensure he is not the DUP’s gofer he needs to stop molly-coddling them he needs to spell out the realities of life to them and to put pressure on his unionist colleagues to ensure that we can land on an equitable and sustainable agreement.”Ms McDonald also told Mr Johnson that any “disorderly Brexit” should result in a Border poll on a united Ireland.She said it was “no great surprise” that with her he “took a different view Brexit generally and on the issue of union”.The SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said her party delegation had a “blunt” engagement with Mr Johnson. “We went into this meeting concerned that he would have a limited understanding of the complexities and fragility of this place and those concerns have been confirmed,” she said.“It is very clear that he views and understands the situation through the eyes of the DUP,” she added.Ms Mallon said Mr Johnson “must avoid a hard Brexit at all costs and stop hurtling us towards it”.On the party’s Brexit concerns she said that Mr Johnson “tried to be dismissive, saying it was doom and gloom – well it’s not”.Catastrophic effectAlliance leader Naomi Long said she made it very clear to Mr Johnson at their “frank and candid” meeting that the “impact of Brexit on the talks here is palpable, it is having a destabilising effect, as would any no-deal Brexit”.“I don’t know if the prime minister has a plan if he does he certainly disguises it well, but I hope that if he does not have a plan today that he goes home tonight fully aware of the need to get one, and get one fast,” she said.Ms Long said she warned Mr Johnson of the “catastrophic effect of a no-deal Brexit here in Northern Ireland”.In relation to the talks she said there was a time when the British and Irish governments needed to apply pressure on the parties to make progress. She added: “The real test of impartiality will come when pressure needs to be applied to the DUP as to whether or not a government that still at this point in time, at least, relies on them for their own existence is willing to apply that pressure equally and fairly when it is required.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann told Mr Johnson that while his party opposed the backstop it also wanted the prime minister to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Mr Swann said he also raised the issue of the past and the UUP’s opposition to “vexatious claims” against former RUC officers and British soldiers and that Mr Johnson told him he would “defend the security services who served here in Northern Ireland”.A protest was held at the Carson statue on the Stormont estate by Harland \u0026amp Wolff workers and union representatives who are seeking support from the British government to prevent the threatened closure of the yard.They chanted, “1, 2, 3, 4, Boris Johnson come out the door 5, 6, 7, 8, meet us at the shipyard gate.”The Border Communities Against Brexit and Irish language activists calling for an Irish language act also staged a demonstration at Stormont.The Ballymurphy Massacre families also staged a protest.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The Minister has to satisfy himself that the governor is the best person to lead the Irish Central Bank and to guide its relations with the ECB at this critical time,” the Wexford TD said.Mr Lane, in private comments, is understood to have discussed how a controversy in New Zealand involving Mr Makhlouf could be managed as he took up his new role in the Central Bank.Mr Makhlouf was approved by the Government in May and he will take up the €286,760 post in September.Lane concernsMr Lane did not raise concerns about the appointment of Mr Makhlouf in and of itself, but rather how the controversy in New Zealand, and its implications for the Central Bank, could be managed as it was unfolding earlier this year. Mr Lane declined to comment when contacted.Mr Makhlouf has been chief executive and secretary of the New Zealand treasury since 2011. He was previously a senior civil servant in the UK, where he was a principal private secretary to Gordon Brown when the latter was chancellor of the exchequer.However, the Government decision was caught up in a controversy involving Mr Makhlouf in New Zealand. It emerged he had claimed the accidental leak of sensitive budgetary material was a result of a hack, but a follow-up police inquiry found no evidence of one.“Mr Makhlouf has been found by the independent State Services Commission to have acted at all times with honesty, integrity and in good faith, and was politically neutral throughout,” the spokeswoman added, in reference to the New Zealand controversy.‘Critical’ reportMr Howlin, however, said the Department of Finance has “played down the findings of an independent inquiry into the New Zealand budget scandal involving Mr Makhlouf”.“While the report indicated that Mr Makhlouf had not acted in an improper fashion, it was severely critical of his actions and he was criticised for not describing the incident accurately.“He has been widely criticised in New Zealand for not taking personal responsibility for the incident and for failing to attend a key parliamentary committee in the aftermath of the incident.“We are entitled to set a higher bar for the competence of the incoming governor than the mere absence of deliberate wrongdoing. The Department of Finance is seeking to whitewash the issues raised in the report.”In a statement responding to New Zealand’s public service watchdog on the affair, Mr Makhlouf said the report “confirms I acted at all times in good faith and with political neutrality” and “I am pleased that my honesty and integrity are not in question”.Well-placed sources said Mr Honohan separately raised private concerns with figures in Government about the appointment of Mr Makhlouf. When contacted, Mr Honohan declined to confirm or deny this and declined to comment.The exact nature of Mr Honohan’s concerns are not known. However, one source argued that Mr Makhlouf comes from a general civil service background, whereas a candidate with more direct experience of the euro zone could have offered an alternative option."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973360.1564591699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"madigan opposes methadone clinic in south dublin constituency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan TD made representations to the department of health about a proposed methadone clinic in her constituency. File photograph: Nick BradshawMinister for Culture Josepha Madigan lobbied to ensure a methadone clinic would not be run from a health centre in her Dublin Rathdown constituency, according to a recent letter to her constituents.Ms Madigan said she had confirmed “that a new methadone clinic will not be developed at Ballinteer Health Centre”, following representations to the Department of Health.“This health centre is used by many local residents and would not be suitable as a methadone clinic,” she wrote in a July letter to constituents.Ballinteer Health Centre is located in Ms Madigan’s Dublin Rathdown constituency.The Minister’s letter to local residents said she had confirmed the existing services in the Ballinteer centre were adequate, and a methadone clinic would not be provided from the centre.“I know many people were concerned about this prospect following the closure of the methadone clinic in Baggot Street,” she wrote.Methadone treatment is prescribed for drug addicts, to act as a substitute for illicit drugs, most commonly heroin.In a statement, a spokesman for Ms Madigan said the Minister “fully supports the provision of health services by the Health Services Executive (HSE), including methadone services for those requiring them in their community”.“After this issue was raised with her by a number of constituents in January, she asked the HSE to clarify its plans. It confirmed that existing services are adequate,” her spokesman said.“The recent letter to constituents, the wording of which did not receive her prior approval before sending, provides an update on the issue,” he said.The correspondence appeared to “celebrate the lack of services for vulnerable groups in her area”.“She has done it before with Travellers, and now drug users,” he said.“Insinuating that she used her ministerial influence to stop this is extremely disappointing . . . For a Cabinet minister to behave like this is a disgrace.”A spokeswoman for the HSE confirmed there were “no plans at present to develop a methadone treatment service in Ballinteer Health Centre”.While seeking a seat on Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council in 2014, Ms Madigan sent a letter to local residents calling plans to build Traveller accommodation on a Mount Anville Road site a

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Brought in as prime minister, Essebsi was elected president in December 2014, and was praised for bringing in a new constitution, free elections and a coalition government that contained both secular and moderate Islamist elements.He championed women’s causes, overcoming conservative resistance to laws allowing women to marry outside their faith and establishing equal inheritance rights.But his critics countered that he was attempting to return to the bad old days by concentrating power in the presidency, as well as failing to give his support to a truth commission designed to bring justice to victims of the old regime.Essebsi casts his vote in the 2011 electionHis time in office also failed to bring greater prosperity, with unemployment having risen thanks to slow growth and low levels of investment. And although Tunisia has generally been regarded as one of the more stable Arab nations, Islamic State terrorism remained a problem throughout Essebsi’s time in office, further damaging the economy.In March 2015, the Bardo Museum in Tunis was attacked, with 21 deaths, many of them tourists. Three months later, 38 people died, most of them British holiday-makers, in an attack on a beach resort near Sousse.Mohamed Beji Caid Essebsi was born on November 29 1926 at Sidi Bou Said in northern Tunisia into an elite landowning family. His grandfather was a Sardinian who had been captured by Tunisian pirates in the 19th century.Essebsi became involved in politics at the age of 15, joining the youth wing of the Neo Destour party. He studied Law in Paris, then in 1952 was called to the Tunis Bar his first cases involved defending members of Neo Destour. He became an adviser to Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia’s first president following independence from France in 1956. Essebsi rose through the ranks and was named Interior Minister in 1965 and Defence Minister in 1969, followed by a stint as Ambassador to France.Although he had been in office during a period of brutal repression in Tunisia he became a critic of the increasingly despotic Bourguiba and an outspoken advocate of greater democracy in the country. In 1972 he resigned his ambassadorship and returned home.In 1981 he returned to politics and was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving for five years, during which time he had to contend with the Palestine Liberation Organisation decamping to Tunis, having been forced out of Beirut, and the US bombing of Libya.Then in 1987 Bourguiba was ousted by Ben Ali in a bloodless coup Essebsi transferred his allegiance to the new man, who appointed him Ambassador to Germany, and in 1990-91 he served as president of the Chamber of Deputies, the pliant lower chamber of Tunisia’s parliament.Following that, for the best part of 20 years Essebsi vanished from public life, until the Arab Spring interrupted his retirement. In December 2010 a fruit-seller, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself alight in the town of Sidi Bouzid in protest at official corruption after his stall had been confiscated. “In Sidi Bouzid, those with no connections and no money for bribes are humiliated and insulted and not allowed to live,” his sister told Reuters.Essebsi in 2018He died a fortnight later, by which time the country was beset by riots and demonstrations, and on February 27 2011 the Prime Minister, Mohamed Ghannouchi, resigned following the death of five protestors. The President, Fouad Mebazaa, appointed Essebsi in his place.The protests continued, however, and Essebsi found it difficult to shake off his history as an ally both of the repressive Bourguiba and the man who had overthrown him, the equally despotic Ben Ali.He remained in office until the end of the year, when he stepped down. He formed a new secularist, Left-leaning party, Nidaa Tounes (“Call for Tunisia”), a coalition of businessmen, trade unionists and politicians, with the aim, he said, of countering “instances of disturbing extremism and violence”. In 2014 he stood against the incumbent, Moncef Marzouki, in the presidential election, winning in the second round.In April 2019, Essebsi announced that he would not stand for re-election later this year, in order to make way for the younger generation.Beji Caid Essebsi married Chadlia Saïda Farhat in 1958. She survives him, along with their two daughters and two sons, one of whom, Hafedh, followed him into politics.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The tanker remains in Iranian hands, with the commander of the British warship that is already accompanying UK-flagged ships on this route saying yesterday that Tehran appeared to be testing the Royal Navy\u0027s resolve. The Iranians seem to be keen to test our resolve, test our reactions most of the time, William King, commander of the HMS Montrose, told the BBC, adding that over 27 days patrolling the region he had experienced 85 interactions with Iranian forces. Germany reportedly rejected calls to take part in the planned taskforce last week, but this is the first time the German government has commented publicly .Mr Scholz said a naval taskforce would be “getting ahead of events”, and that Germany’s priority was to prevent an escalation in the Gulf.“The worst thing would be a real military conflict. Then shipping would really be in jeopardy,” he said.Mr Scholz, the leader of Angela Merkel\u0027s main coalition partner, rejected suggestions the German government is ided over the US request. His centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) have a track record of opposing German involvement in military operations abroad, while Mrs Merkel\u0027s Christian Democrats (CDU) have been more open to the idea.But in this case Mrs Merkel’s government is believed to be reluctant to back a naval taskforce for fear any incident could be used by hardliners in the Trump administration as a pretext for war with Iran.Along with Britain and France, Germany has been keen to rescue the nuclear deal agreed with Iran by Barack Obama, which Mr Trump withdrew from last year.Germany has come under intense pressure from the US over military spending in recent years amid President Trump\u0027s attempts to make Nato\u0027s European members pay more towards the cost of their defence.Mr Trump has been highly critical of Europe\u0027s biggest economy over its failure to meet Nato\u0027s target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is widely seen as Mrs Merkel\u0027s designated successor, recently pledged to meet the target when she took over as defence minister.We made a clear commitment to Nato’s two percent goal. I know that we can’t get there from one day to the next, but I’m just as clear on the fact that we must get there in the end, she said.More than 1,000 methadone prescriptions issued in Scotland every dayIsrael approves hundreds of Palestinian homes in West Bank amid reports of US peace plan rolloutComment: From jousting to Real Tennis, don\u0026#39t let gentlemanly sportmanship fall prey to the tyranny of VAR\tComment: Sinn Fein will be bitterly disappointed if they think Brexit will lead to a United IrelandCambridge University student dies in Madagascar after falling from a planeNew Malaysian king crowned amid reports of predecessor\u0026#39s orce from Russian beauty queenBarclays lawyers killed in avalanche had been skiing \u0026#39on marked route\u0026#39, inquest hearsMichael Sheen says he will have to take on more acting roles after giving  \u0026#39everything\u0026#39 away to charity\u0026#39I\u0026#39m so accident prone\u0026#39, says Andrea Jenkyns after suffering whiplash from swinging on her chairMatteo Salvini in hot water after arranging ride on a police jet ski for  teenage sonBoris Johnson insists he will never be neutral on the Union as Northern Ireland talks come to an end All social workers at councils where child sexual abuse able to \u0026#39flourish\u0026#39 must be re-screened, IICSA urgesComment: The West has abandoned the people of Idlib to a murderous Assad and his jihadist enemiesMatch attacker found guilty of rape for lying to woman about having a vasectomy, in first case of its kindFrench MPs given police protection after spate of office attacksMan, 86, released after murder arrest over woman\u0026#39s remains found in septic tankBlack super new moon 2019: What is it and will we be able to see the lunar event in the UK?Comment: Sorry to disappoint you, Labour, but Priti Patel isn\u0026#39t going to bring back the death penaltyAfter 700 years, Dante could finally be on his way home to Florence  Meet the managers who will transform Love Island\u0026#39s latest \u0026#39talent\u0026#39 into household namesWhy is A$AP Rocky\u0026#39s trial in Sweden getting so much attention?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/31/TELEMMGLPICT000205273125_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"israel approves hundreds palestinian homes west bank amid reports","story":"Israel approved plans for Palestinian homes in the West Bank as well as homes for Jewish settlersIsrael has made an unusual move to approve hundreds of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank amid reports the US is preparing to roll out its long-awaited peace plan. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, granted permits for 700 Palestinian houses but tried to appease his Right-wing base by also approving 6,000 housing units for Jewish settlers.  Israel rarely grants building permits to Palestinians and the move was seen as a potential concession to the White House, which is trying to convince Palestinians and Arab states to back its peace initiative.  Jared Kushner, Mr Trump’s son-in-law and top aide on Israeli-Palestinian issues, is expected in Jerusalem this week to discuss the plan with Mr Netanyahu.  The plan remains secret but Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported Mr Trump intends to unveil it at a summit with Arab leaders at Camp David in the coming weeks.A White House official denied that planning for a summit was underway and said Mr Kushner’s team would report back after their trip to Israeli and Arab states before deciding their next move. “No summit has currently been planned,” the official said. The US unveiled the less controversial economic side of the plan at a conference in Bahrain in June but has not given a timeline for releasing the political side of the plan. Mr Trump enjoys the pageantry of high-profile international meetings and Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, has often been the site of peace talks between Israel and its neighbours.Expectations for Mr Trump’s peace effort are low. The Palestinians have preemptively rejected the plan, arguing that Mr Trump is heavily biased towards Israel and is not an honest broker.  David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel, signaled that the White House opposed the idea of an independent Palestinian state, which has long been a demand of both Palestinians and America’s Arab allies.    Mr Friedman instead endorsed Mr Netanyahu’s position that the Palestinians can be granted autonomy but not a state of their own.  “We believe in Palestinian autonomy,” he told CNN. ”We believe that autonomy should be extended up until the point where it interferes with Israeli security.British art dealer jailed in US over £25 million fraud More than 1,000 methadone prescriptions issued in Scotland every dayComment: From jousting to Real

should have control inheritance judges rule","story":"Widows should have at least some control over the money they inherit, a panel of appeal judges declared after overturning a High Court decision.  Court of AppealWidows should have at least some control over the money they inherit, a panel of appeal judges declared after overturning a High Court decision.The widow of the genius tycoon who made £30million after he brought the black bin liner to Britain has won a landmark victory in a fight over control of his fortune yesterday.Michael Cowan, who died in April 2016 from a brain tumour, aged 78, built his wealth from humble beginnings. Applying a Midas touch for business, he grew his phenomenally successful plastics company, Hanmere Polythene Ltd, until he was a multimillionaire.He married his lover of 25 years, Mary Jane Cowan, in February 2016, but died two months later.He left her with access to hundreds of thousands of pounds in ready cash and also used his will to set up a structure of generous trust funds, designed to meet her every reasonable need for the rest of her life.However, his 77-year-old widow was not happy with the arrangement, which left her with no assets in her own name and no control over her late husband\u0027s millions.Now the Court of Appeal, on which Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Baker also sat, has granted her permission to make a claim against his estate, on the basis that his will did not make reasonable provision for her needs.Mr Justice Mostyn had ruled in the High Court last February that Mrs Cowan had no right to make a claim.He said the widow received around £435,000 in the first year after her husband died and now receives a regular monthly payout, amounting to around £240,000 a year.However, ruling yesterday in the widow\u0027s favour and overturning the High Court decision, Lady Justice Asplin said Mr Justice Mostyn was wrong and had indulged in speculation about Mr Cowan\u0027s motivation in structuring his will in the way that he did.She added that Mr Cowan was distracted from the real question\u0085 whether it was arguable that reasonable financial provision had not been made for Mrs Cowan.In a statement, Mrs Cowan said she was delighted with the result.Court of AppealBritish art dealer jailed in US over £25 million fraud More than 1,000 methadone prescriptions issued in Scotland every dayDaring to dream: The women and girls on HIV\u0026#39s new front lineIsrael approves hundreds of Palestinian homes in West Bank amid reports of US peace plan rolloutComment: From jousting to Real Tennis, don\u0026#39t let gentlemanly sportmanship fall prey to the tyranny of VAR\tComment: Sinn Fein will be bitterly disappointed if they think Brexit will lead to a United IrelandCambridge University student dies in Madagascar after falling from a planeNew Malaysian king crowned amid reports of predecessor\u0026#39s orce from Russian beauty queenBarclays lawyers killed in avalanche had been skiing \u0026#39on marked route\u0026#39, inquest hearsMichael Sheen says he will have to take on more acting roles after giving  \u0026#39everything\u0026#39 away to charity\u0026#39I\u0026#39m so accident prone\u0026#39, says Andrea Jenkyns after suffering whiplash from swinging on her chairMatteo Salvini in hot water after arranging ride on a police jet ski for  teenage sonBoris Johnson insists he will never be neutral on the Union as Northern Ireland talks come to an end All social workers at councils where child sexual abuse able to \u0026#39flourish\u0026#39 must be re-screened, IICSA urgesComment: The West has abandoned the people of Idlib to a murderous Assad and his jihadist enemiesMatch attacker found guilty of rape for lying to woman about having a vasectomy, in first case of its kindFrench MPs given police protection after spate of office attacksMan, 86, released after murder arrest over woman\u0026#39s remains found in septic tankBlack super new moon 2019: What is it and will we be able to see the lunar event in the UK?Comment: Sorry to disappoint you, Labour, but Priti Patel isn\u0026#39t going to bring back the death penaltyGermany rejects US call to join Gulf taskforceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/03/20/apple.jpg","title":"apple iphone sales results latest ipad mac services music","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsCompanies broadening business – with other products like AirPods as well as streaming services like Apple Music – are taking up a bigger and bigger part of resultsClick to followThe Independent TechApple is less and less dependant on the iPhone as its plan to move away from relying on the handset is paying off.The company\u0027s latest results show that sales of the iPhone are actually dropping, with billions of dollars of fewer sales than the same time last year.But that drop was more than made up for by its increasing focus on other products, such as its Music streaming service and payments cloud storage.The iPhone is still the company\u0027s biggest category, and is still worth tens of billions of dollars per quarter.

That was the highest number since the first three months of 2014.Between the end of the last recession in 2009 and the three months following the 2016 EU referendum, quarterly company insolvencies declined steadily to well under 4,000, but in late 2016 they shot up again to over 5,500. Since then, they have averaged 4,330 per quarter.The Federation of Small Businesses, called the latest figures “hugely concerning”, saying they highlight the strain small businesses are under due to rising employment costs, business rates and uncertainty over Brexit.“There’s a real danger that a chaotic, sudden no-deal exit on 31 October will cause insolvencies to spiral further, meaning a significant hit to UK economic growth,” the\u0026nbspFSB\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerNo-deal Brexit is something smaller firms are “simply not prepared” for, it noted, chiming with analysis by another business lobby group, the CBI. Many smaller firms cannot afford to ert human and financial resources to no-deal planning, the CBI said on Monday. But it also warned that, overall, bigger UK companies are not ready for such an outcome either.The risk that Britain will crash out of the EU has risen since the Conservative Party elected Boris Johnson as prime minister last week.Mr Johnson has stuck to his long-standing message that Britain will leave on 31 October “do or die”, reiterating it again on Tuesday. At the same time, chances of a new withdrawal agreement appear increasingly slim as the EU insists the existing deal cannot be renegotiated.The Insolvency Service data also covers iniduals. The data showed that the number of personal insolvencies fell but, at 30,937, remained high. Quarterly personal insolvencies have exceeded 30,000 since late last year – a level not seen since 2011.Pointing to a similar trend, recent data from the Bank of England revealed that defaults on credit card debt rose in the second quarter at the fastest pace in two years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the rollout of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full rollout of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.Created with Sketch.

Spotify shares fell 5 per cent following the update for investors on Wednesday.“We missed on subs. That’s on us,” Spotify’s founder and chief executive Daniel Ek said, referring to subscriber numbers. He said the company expects to “make up lost ground before year-end”.Spotify is still the most popular music streaming service in the world, with almost double the number of paid-up members of its nearest rival Apple.Revenue from subscribers, which accounts for around 90 per cent of Spotify’s overall revenue, rose to €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in the second quarter.Created with Sketch.Spotify tips and tricks Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Search more accuratelyYou can improve the accuracy of your searches by adding extra information, such as dates, genres and albums.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was the highest number since the first three months of 2014.Between the end of the last recession in 2009 and the three months following the 2016 EU referendum, quarterly company insolvencies declined steadily to well under 4,000, but in late 2016 they shot up again to over 5,500. Since then, they have averaged 4,330 per quarter.The Federation of Small Businesses, called the latest figures “hugely concerning”, saying they highlight the strain small businesses are under due to rising employment costs, business rates and uncertainty over Brexit.“There’s a real danger that a chaotic, sudden no-deal exit on 31 October will cause insolvencies to spiral further, meaning a significant hit to UK economic growth,” the\u0026nbspFSB\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerNo-deal Brexit is something smaller firms are “simply not prepared” for, it noted, chiming with analysis by another business lobby group, the CBI. Many smaller firms cannot afford to ert human and financial resources to no-deal planning, the CBI said on Monday. But it also warned that, overall, bigger UK companies are not ready for such an outcome either.The risk that Britain will crash out of the EU has risen since the Conservative Party elected Boris Johnson as prime minister last week.Mr Johnson has stuck to his long-standing message that Britain will leave on 31 October “do or die”, reiterating it again on Tuesday. At the same time, chances of a new withdrawal agreement appear increasingly slim as the EU insists the existing deal cannot be renegotiated.The Insolvency Service data also covers iniduals. The data showed that the number of personal insolvencies fell but, at 30,937, remained high. Quarterly personal insolvencies have exceeded 30,000 since late last year – a level not seen since 2011.Pointing to a similar trend, recent data from the Bank of England revealed that defaults on credit card debt rose in the second quarter at the fastest pace in two years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She had pale brown teeth and a small pucker-up mouth like a dog\u0027s bottom.\u0027 The parents are willing to pay £60 an hour for a tutor who can act the part well, the job advert said.The couple, who wish to remain anonymous, told Tutor House that they will also cover the cost of a Miss Honey outfit – including the round glasses and long pink dress she wears in Matilda.The ideal candidate will resemble actress Embeth Davidtz and will be able to do their hair in a “soft shoulder-length style which flicks out at the end”, the parents added.An applicant is required to have at least three years’ experience in teaching maths – and they must have seen the film of Matilda and read the book.Mother of Matilda star prepared to go to jail over home schooling rowThe agency referred to the email in their blog, and said they were “happy to help” find the right professional “no matter how bizarre their requirements seem to be.“I think it’s really quite inspiring the lengths these parents will go to to ensure their daughter is engaging with her educators and learning in the best possible way for her,” Alex Dyer, Tutor House’s founder, said.He added: “Every child is different, and if one is struggling then it’s important their education is tailored to their needs. Unfortunately state schooling is under such a huge amount of pressure at the moment, it’s near impossible for teachers to deliver bespoke teaching methods.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the rollout of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full rollout of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.Created with Sketch.

As a result, the cap will be increased from 1 October, with prepayment customers paying roughly £1 a week more based on current prices.“A price cap set too low may lead to suppliers leaving the market, reducing both competition and consumer choice.

Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Del Rey is also set to release a new single with Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande for the forthcoming Charlie’s Angels film, coming out in November. \u0026nbspNorman F***ing Rockwell will be released on 30 August.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp.

This species\u0026nbspfeeds on coral and has\u0026nbsp“a devastating impact” on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.Lead author Professor Maurice Elphick said: “Our study has provided important new evidence that oxytocin-type molecules are important and ancient regulators of feeding in animals.Elphick)“So oxytocin is much more than a ‘love hormone’ – perhaps especially for animals like starfish that don’t fall in love.Dr Esther Odekunle, formerly a PhD student at the university, added: “This research may provide a basis for the development of novel chemical methods to control their appetite for coral.”Oxytocin-type molecules have been acting in the nervous systems of animals for more than half a billion years.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Sea creatures seen tangled in plastic Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This turtle was caught in a plastic six-pack ring when young and became deformed as it grew while still trapped in the ringMissouri Department of ConservationSharks and turtles caught in a discarded plastic netA shortfin mako shark tangled in fishing rope.

The hormone\u0026nbsphas also been suggested as a treatment for anxiety, depression, addiction, anorexia and schizophrenia owing to its ability to promote social and bonding behaviour.\u0026nbspStarfish were injected with the hormone and within a few minutes started bending their arms and adopted a “humped”\u0026nbspposture, similar to that used when feeding – and the stomach was then everted from the mouth.The animals feed by climbing onto\u0026nbspshellfish\u0026nbspand adopting this\u0026nbspposture, then using\u0026nbspthe tiny tube feet under their arms to pull apart the two valves of their prey.Tens of thousands of starfish wash up on beach after stormy weatherTens of thousands of starfish wash up on British beachThe starfish then evert their stomach into the gap they have created, before digesting the soft tissues into a soup-like mixture and drawing this back into their body to eat,\u0026nbspaccording to the study\u0026nbsppublished in the journal\u0026nbspBMC\u0026nbspBiology.Professor Elphick said: “What is fascinating is that injecting the hormone in starfish induces what is known as fictive feeding. The starfish are behaving as if they are feeding on a mussel or an oyster but no mussel or oyster is there to be eaten.”The researchers also found the effect of oxytocin was so powerful it made starfish two to three times slower at righting themselves when flipped over – an important defence mechanism when they are upturned by strong waves.They also found that the hormone exists naturally in\u0026nbspregions of the starfish body – including the central nervous system and the stomach – and its effects appeared to be\u0026nbspconsistent with the oxytocin-type molecules.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Department for Transport described the drop as statistically significant.That came despite increases in cyclist numbers in major UK cities, including London where cycling journeys grew by 5 per cent last year.Campaigners pointed to the disparity between cycling rates in the capital and the rest of the country as proof that more money was needed to improve road safety and encourage greater numbers onto their\u0026nbspbikes.The government currently spends £7 per head per year on cycling in England, excluding London - less than half the £18 per head spent in the capital.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Surprisingly, the City of London recorded the largest decrease in\u0026nbspcyclists, from 22 per cent to 11 per cent.However, the report cautioned that the small sample size of the central London district may have skewed the result.Men continue to outnumber women on bikes by more than two-to-one, the report showed. A\u0026nbspperception that it is too dangerous to ride a bike is still the main reason people are put off switching to two wheels.Male cyclists made an average of 25 trips per year compared with just 10 trips for women, with those aged 40-49 most likely to cycle.Painted bike lanes ‘a waste of public money’, cycling experts sayThe survey suggested little progress has been made nationally in promoting cycling as an efficient, healthy and cost-effective mode of transport.Despite efforts to increase cycling uptake to tackle air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, just 2 per cent of all trips made in England are completed by bike – amounting to just 1 per cent of the total distance travelled.That compares with close to two-thirds (61 per cent) of journeys being made by car and around a quarter (27 per cent) on foot.Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK’s head of campaigns, said: “Despite government recognising the need to encourage and enable more people to cycle regularly for health and environmental reasons, unfortunately the proportion of trips made by bike has remained largely static for 20 years.\u0026nbspWhen asked what stops people from cycling more often, the common response is that it’s too dangerous.The reality is that cycling is not a dangerous activity, but it’s this perception which needs to be tackled.\u0026nbspTo do this, we need to build cycling routes separated from motor traffic, safe for a 12 year old to ride along. That requires at least a doubling of current spending on cycling and walking, which must be a priority for the Department for Transport in the forthcoming Spending Review.”Department for Transport\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There were many people, people banging on doors. I was really scared. I was so worried about my husband. I knew he wouldn’t be safe on his own,’ says Ngam​ Ngon LeonardiClick to followThe IndependentA woman who was threatened with imminent deportation from the UK despite having a seriously ill British husband in London has been released from detention after The Independent highlighted the case.Ngam Ngon Leonardi, 52, was detained in Yarl’s Wood two weeks ago and told she would be removed to her native Thailand, leaving her husband Mark, who is in the final stages of kidney failure and has\u0026nbspepilepsy, with no one to care for him.Ms Leonardi was set to be deported at 4pm on Tuesday, but less than two hours before the flight – and shortly after The Independent approached the Home Office for comment on the case – her removal was deferred.\u0026nbspAt around 6pm that day she was released from Yarl’s Wood and given money for a taxi to return to her home in north London. She still has to report monthly to the Home Office though, and hasn’t yet been granted leave to remain in the UK.The Thai national said she was relieved to be at home, but described feeling terrified and constantly worried that Mr Leonardi wouldn’t be able to cope on his own while she was in detention.Home Office in ‘state of disaster management’ amid surge in U-turnsHome Office reverses refusal to allow baby adopted by resident into UKHome Office stages U-turn on decision to reject London-born children“I felt so upset in Yarl’s Wood. There were many people, people banging on doors. I was really scared,” she said. “I was so worried about my husband. He can’t do a lot of things on his own. He can’t lift things. I knew he wouldn’t be safe on his own.“I felt like they were trying to get me out of the country as quickly as possible. They said that if I don’t get removed this time, next time I would be handcuffed.”The couple, who met 15 years ago and got married in 2015, have moved between north London and Thailand throughout their married life. They came to the UK last May, with a plan to go back to Thailand after Ms Leonardi’s six-month tourist visa expired.But during this time, Mr Leonardi became seriously ill due to kidney failure, meaning he had to go on dialysis.\u0026nbspThe couple subsequently decided that – due to both difficulty for him to travel and the lack of treatment available in Thailand – Ms Leonardi would apply for longer-term immigration status in the UK.Wife of seriously ill British man facing imminent deportationThe department also argued that, if he did not have friends or family to care for him in the UK, Mr Leonardi could “access the NHS and any care or support requirements he may have through his local authority”.Mr Leonardi said he was happy to have his wife back at home, but that they were still fearful that she could be detained again.\u0026nbsp“I feel a lot better now that she’s back,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“I can sleep at night now, and I know someone is there in case I have a fit. It’s great for her to be back home.“But we are still worried because she still has to report. We paid all the fees for the visa and everything but they say we’re not allowed to apply from this country. What am I supposed to do while she’s not here? I just think this country is barbaric.”Mary Atkinson, families together campaign officer at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “We are so glad that Ngam\u0026nbspNgon is back home where she belongs –\u0026nbspbut she should never have been put through this ordeal.“The Home Office waited until the very last minute, when she had already been dragged to the airport, to see sense. This is happening every day – anyone who doesn’t happen to have a good lawyer and thousands of supporters is entirely at the mercy of the same poor decision-making that very nearly saw Ngam ​Ngon sent thousands of miles away from her gravely ill partner of 15 years.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “All applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence provided and in accordance with the immigration rules. It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heres everything you need to know about the famous festival.In  the Festival of the Sacrice will begin in the evening of Sunday, August , and end four days later on Thursday, August .The festival marks the prophet Ibrahims willingness to sacrice his son for Allah, but his son was then replaced with a lamb.Millions of Muslims around the world will gather to mark one of the holiest days in the religious calendar.Large groups get together to pray while enjoying feasts and wearing their best clothing.Traditionally, the festival lasts for four days but public holidays y around the world - with Arab countries observing a nine-day public holiday.There are two official holidays in Islam: Eid Al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha.Eid Al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan , and Muslims may invoke zakaton the occasion which begins after the new moon sighting for the beginning of Shawal.The Eid al-Fitr celebration begins with prayers the morning of  Shawal, and is followed by breakfast, and often celebratory meals throughout the day.Eid Al-Adha is celebrated on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah when Hajjtakes place, and lasts for four days.Muslims may invoke an act of zakat and friendship by the slaughter of a sheep and distribute its meat in  parts: among family, friends, and the poor.Muslims are also encouraged to be especially friendly and reach out to one another during this period. It is also known as the Feast of the Sacrice or the Greater Eid.The celebration revolves around when Allah appeared to Ibrahim in a dream and asked him to sacrice his son, Ishmael, as a sign of his faith.It’s similar to the Christian and Jewish stories in which God asked Abraham to sacrice his son Isaac, but spared him from doing so.It is a celebratory festival and men and women will dress up for the occasion.Friends and family gather together to exchange gts and money and eat traditional food.It is tradition to give gts and be given new clothes during Eid al-Adha.Sacrice is a huge part of the tradition.In some countries, families buy, keep and slaughter their own animals.Islamic rules state the animal must be in good health and an adult.The meat from the sacriced animal is traditionally ided into three parts.A third is kept by the family, a third is given to friends and relatives, and a third is donated to the poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to Wired, hed drop acid in the morning before heading off to work.On one harrowing occasion, McAfee snorted an entire bag of a psychedelic powder called DMT. He was found hiding behind a rubbish bin, convinced he could hear voices.Over the next few years, his drug habit escalated, and McAfee found himself doing lines of cocaine at work most days.Unsurprisingly, things eventually came to a head in the early s when his we left him and he was sacked.Contemplating taking his own le like his dad, McAfee finally sought the help he needed to get sober and landed a job as a software engineer for defence contractor Lockheed Martin.While there, he came across the first-known computer virus. He tried to crack it himself - with his success propelling him towards fame and fortune.By , McAfee had established himself as the worlds leading antivirus expert and founded McAfee Associates, with his antivirus product becoming an instant hit. Seven years later, he sold his stake to Intel, netting around £million.With his fortune, McAfee splashed out on properties in Hawaii, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, as well as antique cars and a fleet of planes.In a particularly eccentric move, he also set up a sex yoga ashram school.But after the economic collapse in , bad boy McAfee auctioned off all his belongings, and moved to the Central American jungle, where he bought a villa in picturesque Belize.Desperate to keep old age at bay, the increasingly wacky tycoon would allegedly inject testosterone into his bum every other week.He was also joined in the country by a harem of seven much younger women.“Some people think it is horrendous that I lived with seven women aged between  and ,” McAfee would later tell The Sun. “People can think what they want. The women all got along.He also bizarrely revealed one of his lovers, a teen called Amy, had tried to shoot him.She tried to kill me when we first met, although we got over that, he said.Despite his playboy antics, McAfee never went on porn sites in case he got a virus.I just dont go there, he once told the BBC.During his time in Belize, the businessman started up an antibiotics company and began posting on drug-taking message boards about attempts to pury the compounds within bath salts, Gizmodo reports.However, he began to get paranoid he was being watched, and his business venture turned to ruin when local cops raided his company lab in search of evidence of drug-making.They found a cache of weapons and £, in cash, but no illegal drugs.According to McAfee, the raid marked the beginning of a conspiracy to destroy him - something he believes was revenge for his refusal to be extorted by the Belizean government.He even claimed the authorities were trying to kill him. Belizes Prime Minister Dean Barrow has dismissed McAfees allegations, labelling him “extremely paranoid, even bonkers”, news.au reports.In , McAfee was deemed a person of interest by the nations police - something he remains to be - when his neighbour Gregory Faull was discovered shot dead in a pool of blood.Officers called by McAfees home, but there was no sight of him.The tycoon, who has admitted American Mr Faull was not my favourite person but has denied any involvement in his death, would later claim he buried himself in sand to evade police.He fled Belize, but was arrested in Guatemala in December .He was charged with illegally entering the country, but faked a heart attack to buy some time so his lawyer could stop him being deported back to Belize.The plan seemingly worked - days later, McAfee was sent to the US.Shortly after, McAfee met we Janice, , in Miami Beach, Florida, when he hired her as a prostitute with money loaned to him by a friend, and the pair tied the knot in .But the drama wasnt over yet.The same year, McAfee uploaded a parody video, How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus, showing him criticising McAfee software while snorting powder and surrounded by women.And three years later, he was at the centre of another scandal when the Showtime documentary, Gringo: The dangerous le of John McAfee, was released.It alleged he drugged and raped a former business partner, and committed murder - accusations McAfee has vehemently denied.McAfee was then served with a subpoena by the US Securities and Exchange Commission , reported to be related to his involvement in cyber-currencies. He told Reuters he did not pay income tax for eight years for ideological reasons and was indicted.The following year, McAfee and his we revealed they were living in a Tennessee compound with a   armed bodyguard, claiming they had been followed for the past four years.The same year, McAfee claimed he had been targeted in a poisoning assassination attempt, posting images on Twitter purportedly showing him on le support in hospital.I am more dficult to kill than anyone can possibly imagine, he wrote.Earlier this year, McAfee left his heavily-fortied compound and took off on a yacht to avoid trial, along with Janice, their four large dogs, two security staff and seven staff.The tycoon - who has previously claimed hes fathered  kids - left the States for the Bahamas, then Cuba, after suspecting US law enforcement were trying to extradite him.But last week, the businessman was detained with Janice and his crew in the Dominican Republic - just days after claiming on Twitter that the CIA had tried to collect him.His Twitter feed was taken over by a friend, who warnedJohn misses his next check-in, events will be set into motion - another sign of just how paranoid the tech whizz is.McAfee and his crew were detained for four days, before initially being released on July . But the day after, McAfee claimed to have been arrested for the second time in a week.He shared photos of himself on Twitter, with his arms around his captors - along with the bare-chested image of him in a cell, which Janice deemed her favourite.He claimed he had smuggled a phone into the jail by sleight of hand, adding: If my hands were bigger I could have smuggled a Bangkok prostitute in with me.Soon after, McAfee revealed he and Janice had landed in London, with pictures purportedly showing the pair visiting a restaurant and in a hotel room with some guards.The bad guys never came close, the tycoon tweeted.Now, McAfee has fled once more, to the secret, fortied facility in Lithuania - after claiming the long arm of the US was trying to get him in Britain.And while its unclear exactly where this facility is, one thing is for certain - McAfee will never stop looking over his shoulder for the next attacker.There is an underground network of corrupt national officials that is used by the CIA for nefarious purposes, he claims. I will soon illuminate it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not the civil service nor the BBC. Not the House of Lords. Not Tony Blair and John Major and Gordon Brown. Not the Labour Party.And not the combined might of Bob Geldof, Gary Lineker and the bloke who screams, “STOP BREXIT!” in Parliament Square from dawn till dusk.Oh how they all loathed Brexit and everyone who voted for it! They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris. Democracy is more important than any one politician.And let the record state: It would have worked the other way around.If the British people had decided in the summer of  that we were staying in the European Union, then no amount of bitching from Brussels-loathing old gits such as myself would have mattered a damn.We would have stayed in the EU for a generation. Our current national debate is not ultimately about leaving or remaining.It is about democracy. And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo. You may be a liberal. But you are not much of a democrat.Now the cops have dragged Fadi out, kicking and screaming.The property has been secured but worried neighbours say that Fadi could easily get back in with  a ladder.Oh Fadi, you don’t need a ladder. You need a job.And to stop poncing off the generosity of George Michael.THE Conservative Party is now the true representative of the working class.Lefty loons sneer that the Tories are as riven by racism as Labour, that the anti- Semitism that is rotting Labour is matched by Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.But a political party that disliked Muslims would not appoint the son of a Pakistani bus driver to one of the great offices of state – Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer.And a party that was inherently racist would not promote Priti Patel – the daughter of Hindu refugees – to Home Secretary.And what a joy to see Esther McVey – who spent part of her young le in a Barnardo’s care home –to the Cabinet as Housing Minister.We may have an Old Etonian as PM, but the Tories are the party of the people now.I AM starting to look forward to an autumn general election.The most devastating put-down that our new Prime Minister made in the House of Commons was the one aimed at John McDonnell.“The Shadow Chancellor!” said Boris, jabbing a finger at McDonnell’s florid, furious face. “Sacked by Ken Livingstone for being too left-wing . . .  sacked for fabricating a budget!”Like every bully who ever lived, McDonnell can dish it out but he sure can’t take it.Jeremy Corbyn suddenly looks more like a candidate for a care home than  Downing Street. But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of . Rutger gave one of cinema’s greatest  performances as the android Roy in  Ridley Scott’s  masterpiece, Blade Runner.

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in. He attempted to eclipse her huge achievement and make it all about him.Plus, he put her in a very dficult position. I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist. But it was not him alone who deserves to take the rap.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was succeeded by Ms ONeill.Talks have been restarted several times but have remained deadlocked.A draft deal was even written but it fell through.One of the sticking points from Sinn Fein is that they want an Irish Language Act to give Gaelic parity with English - but the DUP oppose this and see it as an erosion of British identity.But there are also tensions over  same sex marriage after the DUP blocked it using an obsecure petition.And both sides have disagreed over how to deal with historical allegations of violence during the Troubles - and whoanyone should be prosecuted for crimes.But the PM was slammed by critics for having dinner with Arlene Foster, Nigel Dodds and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson last night.Sinn Feins leader Mary Lou McDonald marched straight out of a breakfast with Boris this morning to warn that a dangerous No Deal Brexit will wreck the peace process and trigger a unication referendum.In a blistering attack she accused the new PM of being complacent about the catastrophe facing Ireland and said that hes set the compass to a crash Brexit.We have stated to him very clearly that Brexit in any event but certainly a disorderly Brexit represents a dramatic change in circumstances on this island, she said.And it would be unthinkable in those circumstances that people not be given the opportunity to decide on our future together.No one believed he was truly impartial in trying to get a Government going in Northern Ireland again, she added, demanding he stop being a gopher to the DUP.He tells us he will act with absolute impartiality, she said.We told him nobody believes him.The agreement between the DUP and the Tories which keeps them in power has poisoned talks and made it even harder to continue creating a government, she claimed.To make progress here he needs to ensure he is not the DUPs gopher, stop mollycoddling them and spell out the realities of le to them, she fumed.As his Commons majority hangs by a thread, Boris is still reliant on the  DUP MPs after becoming PM.It could be reduced to just one tomorrowthe Tories lose a by-election as expected in Wales.Boris earlier denied having dinner with the DUP affected the Governments impartiality.Its all there in the Good Friday Agreement, we believe in complete impartiality and thats what we are going to observe, he said.Over dinner the group discussed Brexit, restoring government in Northern Ireland and how to strengthen the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country, Ms Foster said today.We weren’t discussing confidence and supply last night. We were welcoming the Prime Minister to Northern Ireland, she told Good Morning Britain.But the dinner will likely have involved speculative discussions on the price of the DUPs continued support of the Tory party.The DUP said their agreement was still on the cards as they did a deal with the party, not the leader of it.But in the coming months they are set to demand more concessions infor their backing.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which has long been a spot for violence as seen during the troubles.And it would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade - keeping Britain in a single customs territory with the EU.This would also leave Northern Ireland in the EUs single market for goods - meaning goods crossing the border would not be subject to checks for customs or product standards.That would then mean a border in the Irish sea for goods checks, leaving Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the UK.Essentially, the backstop ties the UK to the EUs rules and procedures, even though were technically outside of the bloc.The EU think were getting a good deal by staying close but technically being out, but Brits are fuming well be unable to strike out alone and will be bound by the blocs rules for years to come.Theres no time limit on the backstop either, so it could exist indefinitely and tie us in limbo forever.Boris has visited Scotland and Wales this week, but got booed by the public.He held tense talks with First Ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford about Brexit, and insisted we are leaving on October  no matter what.Andwere forced out without an agreement, it will be Brussels fault, he said.But he hoped that a deal would be on the cards which would include a transition arrangement too, meaning we wouldnt face a sharp edge exit.Last night Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay spoke to EU boss Michel Barnier and again stressed that were leaving in October come what may."},{"url":null,"title":"ellis street clegg leeds","story":"Ellis Street-Clegg was last seen at about .pm yesterday afternoon in Middleton Park.The lad is described as white, about ft in tall, of a slim build and has dark brown hair.Ellis was wearing black tracksuit bottoms, a white shirt and black Nike trainers with orange laces when he vanished.Officers are appealing for anyone who thinks they have seen Ellis or anyone who has information on his whereabouts to contact police.Anyone with information should contact Leeds CID on , quoting log number  of  .For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online, where we will bring you live updates as soon as they happen, before anyone .Like us on Facebook at www.facebook thesun, and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSun, where we will bring you this story and all the rest of the top news and exclusives of the day.TheSun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-le stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see videoOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From then on the doctor had to come out every day.I had to hold her down while he changed her dressings. It was heartbreaking to see her in so much pain.The mum, a nail technician from West Lothian, said her daughter would try to run away every time she saw the doctor arrive as it hurt so much to change the bandages.She added: She was in such agony that we couldn’t go anywhere with her – she couldn’t walk normally without her legs rubbing together and it hurt for her to even sit down.Sarah said it took about four months for Esmes wounds to heal after the October holiday last year, with the youngster left with scars.And she said her little girl was even too scared to go swimming again.Sarah explained: She doesn’t want to go swimming.

I never thought for a second that something like this could happen.I would have expected something from James Villas but we’ve had no letter, no apology, nothing.It probably isn’t a big deal to them but I saved up all year for that holiday. Esme obviously suffered the most but what happened ruined it for all of us.We couldn’t use the pool, which you really want to do when it’s so hot, and then when we were moved to a dferent villa it was no longer in walking distance of all the local amenities which is one of the reasons we chose it in the first place.Laura Vedrines, a specialist travel lawyer at Slater and Gordon who is acting for the family, added: Anyone with children will know that you only have to turn your back for a second for them to get into mischief, but this was a hazard that no parent would have been able to spot.The family are also particularly upset that no one from James Villa Holidays has reached out to them to apologise or enquire after Esme’s health.All tour operators have a duty of care towards their customers and in this case that was to ensure that safe levels of chemicals were maintained in the pool.Had they done so, the injury and distress caused by this could have been avoided. Thankfully Esme has made a good recovery but it could easily have been far worse.James Villa Holidays said it was unable to comment due to it being an ongoing legal case.But a spokesman added: However, we take the welfare of all our customers extremely seriously and all our pools are subject to laws and regulations set out by the countries in which we operate.”"},{"url":null,"title":"faulty wave machine creates massive tsunami injuring 44 swimmers chinese waterpark","story":"Tourists can be heard screaming in video footage as the mountain of water launches over the barrier, forcing people to swim for their lives.The incident occurred at the hugely popular summer tourist resort known as the Shuiyun Water Park on July .The large wave pool is part of the Yulong Bay Scenic Area in Jilin Province, north-eastern China.Footage taken by visitors shows swimmers inside the wave pool suddenly faced with the large wave produced by the wave machine.Described as a tsunami, the huge wave can be seen sweeping away tourists, flipping many of them and their swimming flotation rings upside-down in the chaos.The video shows visitors, who were standing outside the wave pool, running for their lives as they realise the unusually large wave is going to splash over the barrier.Among the dozens injured was a woman, shown in the clip, sprawled on the ground and bleeding from her legs.A spokesman for the water park told local media that the freak wave, was caused by a mechanical fault.The wave pool was closed for a day for repairs.

You know, when you just survive.”Simon Greave, Labour leader in Bassetlaw, Notts, one of the communities the report focused on, said people were fed up and beyond frustrated with Westminsters dilly-dallying over Brexit.He said people in his town wanted the whistle blown on game-playing with Brussels so Britains big domestic issues could be tackled.He told The Sun: People knew what they were voting for.The fact that some decision-makers don’t want to listen is a Westminster problem, not one created by local people in Worksop.The fact is that in Worksopcrime is lower, deprivation is lower and unemployment is lower.Comparisons like this mean nothing though when you’re working all hours to make ends meet, without access to affordable childcare and support for your family.People don’t want hand outs, we want the opportunities we are entitled to, with the chance of better paid more secure jobs for themselves and their children.”Both the Tories and Labour have highlighted that small towns will be the battleground for the next election.Boris promised a substantial cash splurge and Labour hired an award-winning director to make a three-minute film to show its commitment to small towns last year.Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, is delighted Boris has put towns and cities at the heart of his Government already.He told The Sun: I’ve been really pleased that Boris has put the regions and post industrial towns like Mansfield at the centre of his policy agenda.But many in small towns feel left behind and “disillusioned” with the Westminster machine.They feel like politicians don’t care about areas outside of London and communities that once thrived have been left to fend for themselves.One man, from Newport, South Wales, said: Westminster and the government are London-centric, and the further west, east, north you go, you know, the poorer things are.Towns close to Britains biggest cities were losing out twice, according to the JRF, as they fight both London and their nearest neighbour for investment and funding.A woman from Bolton, a town  miles from Manchester, which voted  per cent to Leave, said: I think what we could call traditional working class areas, theyre declined to the benefit of richer areas where people want to invest money - rather than actually investing it areas where it would make a dference to local le.Another woman from Middlesbrough, a city where  per cent voted Leave, said: “We’ve been sort of left in this area.”While big businesses flock to Britain’s cities like London, Manchester and Birmingham – small cities and towns are left to pick off the scraps.“It’s all low paid jobs, so to be able to bring up the area in general, we need people with higher paid jobs, she said.“They need to be more companies to be brought in that aren’t just distribution centres so we need incentives.”Boris has promised to inject cash for improved transport, housing and leisure facilities to reverse decades of decline and neglect in Britain’s towns.Up to  forgotten towns will get a share of the fund under a drive to unite and “level up” the country.He vowed to create a new “golden age” for Britain and declared: “We’re going to put proper money into places that need it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"emily thornberry says labour would","story":"NewsEmily Thornberry says Labour would be off our bloody rockers not to back RemainThe remarks appear to be at odds with Labours official policyShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has said Labour would be off our bloody rockers not to back staying in the European Union.

Ellis Tankard, , has had chronic constipation since he was just one year old.The condition made him unable to go to the bathroom without medical intervention, and he had to be regularly rushed to hospital to empty his bowls, HullLive reported.His debilitating condition became so bad that at one point he even vomited up his own faeces. After this happened doctors decided to surgically intervene, and Ellisapos le changed forever.  Ever since he was little, we were rushing Ellis in and out of hospital for treatment because he struggled to go to the toilet, said Ellisapos mum, Liz Sewell. He couldnapost do anything and used to be crouching down all the time because he had the urge to poo but couldnapost go. He could hardly walk because his bum was blistered and bleeding from straining, which also put him off doing any activities due to the pain. Ellisapos illness got that bad that he was throwing up his own poo because he couldnapost manage to go to the toilet, and after that happened, consultants decided the medication that he was swallowing down to help him go was just not working. That was when surgeons decided to intervene, installing a button that would allow Elias to go to the bathroom.    When he was four years old he had surgery to fit him with a mic-key button that means he gets medication fed in to his tummy through the button, which leads directly to his stomach to allow him to go,apos his mum said. Heaposs also had two operations including having his appendix moved since, but his bowel just doesnapost seem to want to work. Ellisapos condition is called chronic constipation but it is not known how it can be cured. Doctors hope that in time Ellisapos bowel will recty itself and start working normally but they do not know whether this will happen. If his condition does not naturally recty itself or worsen, Ellis will have to be fitted with a stoma bag as an adult. But mum-of-three Miss Sewell, , says that the mic-key button has given her son a new lease of le, with Ellis not letting his illness hold him back. Ellisapos quality of le has been improved so much after his mic-key button was fitted and he can now go swimming, play rugby, go on a bouncy castle and just do the same activities as any other child, she said. Heaposs taken it all in his stride and has been so brave with everything thataposs happened to him, and is a caring, loving boy that would do anything for anyone. Heaposs been through so much for a child of his age with all the operations, hospital admissions and blood tests heaposs had, as well as taking medication every day and needing his button changing every five or six months.

However Becky Parsons, owner of Pablo and Maggie, has hit out on social media saying you let our dogs die. The -year-old added our lives will never be the the same.

April Lock, from Streetly, who owned Ralph and Charlie, told BirminghamLive: At the moment all we know is they did die in the dog sitter’s care. We still want our dogs back. “We found out on Monday eveningthat they are no longer alive. I am broken. It is just awful. We always had that hope that they would come home. We still had that tiny bit of hope that they were out there. She added: I dropped the dogs off at the sitter’s in Sutton Coldfield and I understand they were taken to a house in Erdington.

On one occasion, Tamika Rosser, Jack Delaney, and Adrian O’Neil ordered food and met the driver armed with knives while demanding money. A separate time saw the trio order pizza before following their victim driver to his vehicle and hitting him on the knee with a metal bar, Wales Online reports. In another incident O’Neil grabbed a taxi driver around the throat from behind and “squeezed tightly”. A week after being arrested, Rosser drank a bottle of vodka before grabbing a kitchen kne and a pair of scissors and chasing a neighbour down the street, a court heard. The court heard how she threatened to kill him before she damaged his house and car.    A judge said the three defendants could perhaps best be described as “feral” youngsters whose serious antisocial behaviour knew no limits.He told the trio – aged , , and  – they had no respect for anything or anybody and sent them all into custody. The female defendant will serve her sentence in the same prison where her mother is being held. Swansea Crown Court heard late on the afternoon of May  this year a woman calling herself Jade rang a branch of Domino’s and ordered food to be delivered to flats in Penlan, Swansea. Kevin Jones, prosecuting, said Rosser, Delaney, and O’Neil – who is also known as Adrian Welch and Adrian Walsh – came down from Delaney’s flat and met the driver in the foyer of the block.    The group tried to snatch the bag of food from the delivery man but after a brief “tug of war” with the driver he retreated back to his car still holding the pizzas. The court heard the trio followed their victim to the vehicle and hit him on the knee with a metal bar before grabbing the food and going back into the flats via a fire exit they had previously jammed open. That evening the defendants set another trap, calling a second local pizza delivery firm and ordering more food. Mr Jones said when the driver arrived, Delaney and O’Neil again met their victim in the foyer – this time armed with knives.A scuffle ensued with the defendants brandishing the weapons and demanding money. The driver managed to knock one of the men down before going back to his car and telephoning friends for help.  The driver then armed himself with a wheel brace and charged Delaney and O’Neil in the entrance to the flats, striking O’Neil several times.Delaney made off but was caught and brought back to the flats. Mr Jones said O’Neil managed to flee back to the flat where he armed himself with a kettle of water and ed to the foyer and another scuffle with the driver then followed.Eventually the delivery driver and his friends left the scene.In the early hours of the following morning the trio ordered a taxi and went to Townhill. Rosser got out of the front passenger seat of the vehicle, leaving the two men in the back, and O’Neil then grabbed the cabbie around the throat from behind and “squeezed tightly”. The men began shouting at the driver and told him they had knives and said they would “cut” him. The prosecutor said the taxi driver drove off in a panic and managed to stop an oncoming car at which which point Delaney and O’Neil ran off. Police were alerted to the spree of offending and, realising they were in trouble, Rosser and Delaney tried to smash CCTV cameras at the block of flats in Penlan in an attempt to destroy evidence. The court heard that after being arrested Rosser was released on court bail to a specialist residential unit in Abertillery.A week later she drank a bottle of vodka then grabbed a kitchen kne and a pair of scissors and chased a neighbour down the street and threatened to kill him before she damaged his house and car. Rosser, , of Swansea, pleaded guilty to robbery and criminal damage in respect of the Penlan matters and to affray, two counts of possessing a bladed article, making threats to kill, and criminal damage over what happened in Abertillery.Delaney, , of Penlan, Swansea, admitted robbery, two counts of attempted robbery, and one count of criminal damage. Meanwhile, -year-old O’Neil, of Swansea, pleaded guilty to robbery and two counts of attempted robbery.The court heard Rosser has previous convictions for assaulting a custody officer and shoplting while Delaney has  previous convictions for  offences including for common assault, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, dishonesty matters, and possession of lock kne outside a McDonaldaposs. O’Neil has eight previous convictions for  offences including for inflicting grievous bodily harm when he attacked a man with a golf club in the street while shouting: “This is how we do it in Ireland”.That incident left his victim with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. Barrister Nicola Powell, for Rosser, said her client had been under the influence of a “concoction” of substances on the day in question and had described her own behaviour as “pathetic” and driven by drugs.Ms Powell said Swansea council social services regarded Rosser as a “signicantly vulnerable person”. David Singh, for Delaney, said the defendant had a “limited recollection of what happened” on the night in question and was remorseful. Huw Davies, for O’Neil – who refused to leave his cell for the sentencing hearing – asked the judge to bear in mind the defendant’s young age and asked him not to impose a sentence of suchthat his client would “lose sight of his release date”. Judge Geraint Walters said the three defendants could perhaps best be described as “feral” youngsters. He told them: “The three of you have no respect for anything or anybody – not even yourselves. “Each of you had troubled upbringings but that cannot continue to be used as an excuse for serious antisocial behaviour which seems to know no limits and which,anything, seems to be increasing in seriousness. “You are all still young and I have to bear that in mind – I need to temper the guidelines to account for your ages.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girls head inflates festival carries","story":"NewsGirls head inflates at festival - but carries on the fun till her eyes swell shutCaitlyn has a grass and wheat allergy, and she and her friends thought it was hilariousShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  JUL NewsPollen in the air sets off the allergic reaction that can inflame peoples airways and trigger asthma symptoms \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSome people allow very little to get int between them and having a good time.Take Caitlyn, for example, who recently had an allergic reaction while at Kendall Calling.Luckily a she was fine and b her mate Rhiannon was on hand to gently poke fun at her and lovingly document her friendaposs head swelling to the point where her eyes were practically swollen shut.

Children playing in the street witnessed Leanne, , Louise, , and Samantha, , shouting and screaming at their victim, the Liverpool Echo reports. However, the three single mums walked free from Liverpool Crown Court after the judge ruled that their imprisonment would cause signicant harm to their children. Prosecutors said there was a dispute between the sisters and the paternal gran of Samanthaaposs children, Deborah McKenna, over a dog. They said Ms McKenna and her son Thomas Carson had made reports to social services about the welfare of children, but no action was taken.    Paul Becker, prosecuting, said it later involved Katie Cunningham, the girlfriend of Mr Carson, and Mr Taylor, a friend of the McKenna family. He said all parties on both sides of the dispute were warned by a housing association about their behaviour before the incident, on August  last year. The Whelan sisters said they were driving to their mumaposs when they saw Ms Cunningham outside Mr Carsonaposs house in Alwen Street, Birkenhead. Prosecutors accepted it was a chance encounter but they got out of a silver Mercedes and shouted come on letaposs go before Leanne got a hammer. Ms Cunningham fled into the house but Mr Taylor, who was in the back garden and heard shouting, came out to investigate. Mr Becker said the sisters shouted to Ms Cunningham and Ms McKenna to come out, but Mr Taylor told them to calm down. He said: Samantha Whelan was abusive and said aposf*** off, we donapost want you. Mr Becker said Mr Taylor stood his ground and Leanne swung the hammer, missing his upper body, during chaotic scenes. He said: Leanne Whelan was seen to be bouncing towards Mr Taylor, threatening and generally acting aggressively. Mr Taylor was shocked and scared. Mr Becker said the victim backed off and the sisters walked away but were all shouting homophobic comments about Mr Taylor    He said they also made threats to Ms Cunningham, screaming youaposre getting this over your head. Mr Taylor said he was left feeling depressed and anxious, looking over his shoulder all the time and struggling to sleep at night. The Whelan sisters said the victims were lying and claimed to have alibis, before admitting threatening behaviour ahead of a trial. Leanne, of Treetops Drive, Bidston, who has five previous convictions for  offences, also admitted possessing an offensive weapon. Her criminal record includes assaulting a police officer, common assault and assault causing actual bodily harm. Andrew McInnes, defending Leanne, said an allegation was made that Ms Cunningham assaulted one of the sisters the previous day. He said remorseful and embarrassed Leanne was a good mother to her children, aged seven months, three and . Mr McInnes said both Leanne and her two eldest children had dficulties, but she had since avoided the victims and planned to leave Birkenhead. Louise, of Wakefield Drive, Leasowe, has  previous convictions for  offences, including racially aggravated harassment against a supermarket security guard.    Anna Duke, defending Louise, said her client had two daughters, aged seven and nine, who suffered from ADHD and dyspraxia. She said a medical report found Louise could be very impulsive and lacked thinking skills, but she had signed up for counselling. Samantha, of Tollemache Road, Oxton, has three previous convictions for assaulting a police officer, battery and shoplting. Bernice Campbell, defending Samantha, said she had a daughter, , and son, aged four, who was awaiting an assessment for autism. She said: Samantha Whelan has been a victim herself, calling the police after she got beat up in front of her four-year-old child. Judge Gary Woodhall said Mr Taylor was subjected to homophobic abuse and the sistersapos emotions got out of control. He said: It appears the background to this offence was either a falling out over a dog or allegations of sexual impropriety and the like. Whatever it was, it led to a dispute between extended family members and tensions increasing up to the day of this offence. Clearly issues were ongoing for some time. Various complaints were made to social services including about the welfare of children. All parties involved - both sides - were warned about their behaviour by a housing association. Various allegations made to police were not prosecuted. Whatever the rights and wrongs of this dispute, itaposs clear to me by August  last year, you three resented the way things had not been investigated or not prosecuted, you three resented the way the witnesses in this case behaved, and you were angry and upset.

We have bins in place to collect all the used batteries you can find. Christina Turner, associate marketing director at Duracell said: Generation Z are increasingly making their voices on sustainability heard.    By reflecting the provocative tone of the young activist movement and shining a spotlight on these young change makers, the Big Battery Hunt aims to inspire long-term, positive recycling behaviours. We have been so impressed with the efforts of the . million students involved in the Big Battery Hunt this year and our recycled battery elephant is a true celebration of all those involved. The participation this year has been overwhelming, with over % of all primary schools in the UK getting involved. Thataposs a lot of children driving change.

The beaming Duchess of Sussex can be seen lovingly holding her blossoming baby bump during the quiet visits to charity Smart Works over the last year. In another photo she pats her stomach while sat at a table as they discuss ideas. In a third snap she is also seen surveying a rack of clothes. The discreet trips were arranged months before she gave birth to son Archie in May. The -year-old, who will celebrate her birthday on Sunday, was moved by the impactful work being done by the non profit organisation, Smart Works, which helps women into the workforce.    It equips them with both the skills and clothes they need to feel job-ready, but Meghan noticed that the donations were a combination of mismatched items and colours. The style-conscious duchess felt the clothes didn’t necessarily “suit” the job at hand: to make a woman feel confident and inspired as she walked into her job interview. So this autumn, Meghan will be supporting a collection to help equip the women of Smart Works with the key workwear essentials they need as they enter into the workplace.  She has teamed up with leading British retailers to create a capsule collection of womenaposs clothing. Meghan asked John Lewis, Marks  Spencer, Jigsaw and her fashion designer pal Misha Nonoo to create a fashion line which will benefit her patronage.Writing in the September issue of Vogue, which she guest edited, the new mum explained: When you walk into a Smart Works space you’re met with racks of clothing and an array of bags and shoes.Sometimes, however, it can be a potpourri of mismatched sizes and colours, not always the right stylistic choices or range of sizes.  To help with this, I asked Marks  Spencer, John Lewis  Partners, Jigsaw and my friend, the designer Misha Nonoo,they were willing to design a capsule collection of more classic options for a workwear wardrobe. Taking the idea further, many of the brands agreed to use the one-for-one model: for each item purchased by a customer, one is donated to the charity. Not only does this allow us to be part of each other’s story, it reminds us we are in it together. A spokesman for the Duchess added: This initiative is supported by four generous brands who share the vision to empower the women of Smart Works to look and feel as they bravely venture in to what can often be a daunting environment for those who have been out of the job market.  "},{"url":null,"title":"mum claims washing machine door","story":"NewsMum claims washing machine door exploded sending shards across kitchenSarah-Louise Bell was horried when the door of her £ Bush washing machine shatteredShareCommentsByBethan SextonKelly-Ann Mills:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsSarah-Louise Bell wants to warn others \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA terried mum claims her washing machine door exploded sending five inch glass shards across her kitchen floor.

Writing in her book  aposThe Queen and Di: The Untold Storyapos, Ingrid reveals: On the day their separation was announced, Charles and Diana met in the first-floor drawing room Diana called the salon of her apartment at Kensington Palace. “They sat together on the yellow brocade-covered sofa, reports the Express.She continues to tell how Diana asked Charles, Why did this have to happen  as she sat across from him in the drawing room.

Excitement was growing around the world as the couple prepared to tie the knot in what would be the wedding of the decade. Angela Rippon, the anchor on BBC news, and ITVaposs Andrew Gardener were the two lucky journalists invited to quiz the couple. Their questions had to be pre-approved and they were warned not to stray from the script, and Charles and Diana came across as a couple very much in love and looking forward to their wedding. But looking back with hindsight, there was one moment of the interview which revealed the heartbreaking reality. Speaking in a new Channel  documentary Angela discussed the interview in depth for the first time. She said: When we first arrived at the Palace and met Prince Charles and Diana in a corridor, Prince Charles as always was very relaxed. Lady Diana less so, it was a whole new experience for her. Before they went in they were given a briefing by the Queenaposs press secretary Michael Shea. He told them very firmly that the interview would be endedthey asked any questions that had not been agreed.  During the interview Michael stood directly behind Angela out of camera shot, but in Dianaaposs eyeline. Iaposm not quite sure how comfortable it made her feel. I got the impression that Princes Charles was very protective towards her. Lady Diana was almost slumped in the chair, she was in new territory. She was out of her depth.

The chaotic scene was filmed at the wave pool located Shuiyun Water Park in north eastern China on July . Footage taken by visitors shows swimmers suddenly faced with the large wave produced by the wave machine. The tidal wave, which was described as apostsunamiapos, can be seen sweeping away tourists, flipping them and their swimming rings.    The video shows visitors standing outside the wave pool running for their lives too as they realise the unusually large wave is going to splash over the barrier. Tourists can be heard screaming as the water is launched over the barrier and a number of them are knocked over by the tidal wave.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1dba5e6501d1.45553844.jpg ","title":"a look at dundee uniteds options for championship opener this weekend","story":"Being a manager who prepares meticulously for every game, it’s a safe bet Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson already knows his starting line-up for Saturday’s Championship opener against Inverness Caley Thistle.Of course, we won’t know what his thoughts on that are until an hour before kick-off at Tannadice.And while Arabs who’ve been following the team closely since the start of pre-season will have a fair idea of most of the names on the team sheet, there are two or three areas the manager will have had to give a lot of thought to.Although United’s spending power means Neilson has cover for every position the friendlies and Betfred Cup games over the past few weeks have given a pretty clear indication of what he regards as he strongest side – almost.Starting from the back, that Benjamin Siegrist will be in goal against ICT is a given.In one Betfred outing and a couple of friendlies, the ing Deniz Mehmet has shown himself to be a more-than-able deputy andSiegrist was to suffer a loss of form or injury, there would be no worries about him stepping up.Siegrist’s form toward the end of last season and in his games so far, though, mean he is a certainty to start the league campaign as No  – and rightly so.Likewise at right-back, summer signing Liam Smith is nailed on to make his Championship debut in this one. The manager fought hard to get him and,Ayr United had been willing to do business, would have signed him in January.Smith fits the attacking profile Neilson wants of his full-backs and has done enough in his early games to suggest he’ll be both a regular starter and an important player in the months to come.Next to him, the names of skipper Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly could be written in indelible ink on the team lines.They’ve been the first choice partnership in the middle of the defence since the beginning of February and, so long as they are fit and available, that will continue to be the case this term.The first big question regarding Saturday comes at left-back. Argentine Adrian Sporle was brought in to play there but his outings so far have shown he’ll need time to adjust to Scottish football.That and the form of Jamie Robson suggests the Scot could get the nod, at least for the early weeks of the season.In midfield, Paul McMullan will surely start wide on the right and,he needs to sharpen up on his delivery, his direct running and ability to go past defenders makes him another key man.In the middle Calum Butcher’s strength and experience means he’s sure of his place and beside him will be Sam Stanton or Ian Harkes, both of whom the manager knows he can rely on.Right now the front places, whether it’s as two out-and-out strikers or one up top and the other slightly withdrawn, are also easy to predict.That will go to Nicky Clark and marquee signing Lawrence Shankland. Clark’s habit of getting important goals makes him valuable and Shankland has done enough in his short time at the club to show he can be the main supply of goals this season.With Peter Pawlett and Osman Sow both nearing fitness again, the attacking options should increase in the next couple of weeks or so and, once that’s the case, the manager’s job in selecting a team will be more dficult.He also knows he can now call on the young trio of Louis Appere, Scott Banks and Logan Chalmers.They’ve all shown they are ready to play a part at first-team level but, right now, there is no need to throw them in."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-nightlife-entertainment-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-big-nights-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"city-s-first-female-lord-provost-tea-tycoon-greatest-glaswegians","story":"WHO do you think is the greatest Glaswegian of all time  This summer we are showcasing the top  men and woman who have put the city on the map.

being painted on walls across Torry as part of a mental health project and efforts to improve the perception of the historic fishing community.They will also form part of a mental health art walk to be held in the autumn, with all the artists telling the stories behind their respective visions.The VictoriArt Road arts group is behind the scheme and efforts to brighten up a wall have begun.City artist Katie Guthrie is currently painting on a blank wall at Nigg Bay golf club on St Fittick’s Road.It is one of four artworks planned and it will show the community’s relationship with its surrounding environment.The other artworks planned are a yarn-based mural at Victoria Carpets, an abstract scene at the Marine Scotland lab building and a mural on a wall opposite Tullos Primary School, all due to appear in the coming weeks. vw, px\"  Steven Bedford, from VictoriArt Road, hopes the mural project will change the perception of Torry.He said: “We hope these artworks will improve local residents and the city-wide impression of Torry.“We want to spark people’s curiosity and inspire them to get more involved in art and in their community too.“We hold a meeting every month on how to push the project forward and we would love itmore people would come along and share their ideas or want to get involved in creative practices.”Steven said they have run into an issue at the golf club with the wall there requiring more paint than expected.He said: “The mural located at the Nigg Bay Golf club is still unfinished due to the wall sucking up paint more than expected.“Katie has ordered more and hopes to finish it soon.“There are another three artists who will soon create artworks – Frieda Strachan will be creating a yarn-based mural at the carpet shop on Victoria Road, Isla Valentine will be painting an abstract scene on the Marine Lab and a street artist named Fit Like will be working with Tullos Primary School to create a mural on the wall opposite the school.”The murals will be used as part of a mental health walk planned for September .It will give artists the chance to explain the inspiration behind their work.Workshops and talks from each of the artists involved will give an insight into the process of creating the murals and the inspiration behind them.The VictoriArt Road group were inspired by Aberdeen’s annual Nuart festival and secured a £, grant from the Health Improvement Fund to allow the project to go ahead.The organisation applied to the city council for permission for the murals and it was granted last month.A report submitted alongside the application set out the group’s vision for artworks around Torry.The document said: “We are a collective of residents, artists, activists and community workers.“Our ethos is that creativity is fundamental to the human experience, that beauty is a basic need and that public art improves lives and contributes to social justice.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.6551027-2-240x180.jpg

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at lithicsresearch@btinternetPIC:An artists rendering of Argyll#s ancestors making tools. no_aargyllarcheology"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

Prestonpans gave their sculpture an environment theme as Oor Earth Wullie, highlighting the importance of caring for the planet and not dropping litter.Pupils came up with lots of ideas for their decorations in competitions across the schools.At Cockenzie Primary School, Natasha OrsquoConnor, depute headteacher, said it had been impossible to choose a winning design from youngsters so they combined them.She said: ldquoThere were so many fantastic entries that we ended up doing a combined design of a number of entries.ldquoIt mainly features a sea and fishing boat pattern on his

ldquoAll the classes came up with their own ideas and when we came together to discuss them we found many of the ideas were the same so we worked together to create a plan.ldquoOne of our staff members, Mrs Fiddler, is a talented artist and she worked with the children to turn their ideas into a design, which incorporates many of the themes from the schoolrsquos badge. Every class had some time painting the statue. He was finally nished then shown to all the boys and girls and parents. We are all very proud of the end result.All the childrenrsquos work can be seen in displays across Edinburgh at the Portrait Gallery, Museum of Childhood and Ocean Terminal.Sandcastlersquos sculpture is on show at Jenners store.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education, said: ldquoIrsquom so impressed with the dferent approaches that all of the schools have taken when designing their Oor Wullie statues. Many have used mots personal to their school and area, adding a touch of East Lothian to this much-loved character.ldquoItrsquos great that East Lothian schools have been so involved and Irsquom sure all of the statues will be admired by everyone who sees them in high-profile venues.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

It was such an overwhelmingly positive response.\"Dr Krishan, who works as a GP in the East End of Glasgow, has gained a raft of followers who enjoy her warmth, candour and thought-provoking posts on social media where she is an impassioned proponent about the importance of kindness.\"I always say to my medical students and trainees that learning the science is the easy bit,\" she says. \"We can learn from textbooks, absorb the knowledge and spout that out. But it means nothingit is not delivered with compassion and care.\"It is a theme we come back to several times in our conversation. Hearing Dr Krishan talk about her love of being a GP, it is hard to believe she almost never took that path.The eldest of two daughters, she grew up in Glasgow and describes herself as being \"raised on curry and Irn Bru\". Her Indian-born parents arrived from Punjab in the late s. \"We grew up in my dads corner shop,\" she says. \"It was ingrained in us that education was the key to freedom.

My mum had an arranged marriage. She was going to study medicine in India but couldnt because she came to Scotland to be married. Both my sister and I went to the University of Glasgow to study medicine. We are both GPs in Glasgow.\"On paper it sounds like a picture-perfect le trajectory, yet Dr Krishan reveals that in her teens, there was a point when she went off the rails.\"I was a nightmare for my mum and dad,\" she recalls. \"Growing up, I was confused about where I truly belonged. Our summer holidays were always spent in India. I had very much my Indian existence at home, but all my friends were Caucasian.\"There were a lot of restrictions and being told: You cant do this you cant do that ndash what will the aunties think  which I found frustrating.

Dr Krishan also hopes to pen a memoir about her experiences working as a GP.\"My dream is to write books to help as many people as I can through informed and reflective storytelling in a bid to inspire and empower them along their wellness journeys. I want to bring my Eastern heritage and the wisdom that holds into my scientic Western practice.\":Why we love Glasgows street artThe traditional role of a doctor advocates an evidence-based scientic approach to clinical care. It is important to maintain professional boundaries, yet Dr Krishan strongly believes that patients need compassion too.Such as instinctively hugging a patient who had been diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. Two weeks later, after the man passed away, his family visited her to say thank you and tell her how much that hug had meant to him.\"Le has been kind to me in that it has taught me lessons ndash sometimes in the most brutal ways,\" she says. \"I have been the vulnerable mum and I have ageing parents, so I understand the pain that brings. I have also lived as a troubled teenager trying to find my identity.\"With this man who was dying of cancer, I was helpless. There was nothing I could do. He knew that and I could see the fear in his eyes.

So voters must have been misled .And because, these days, your opponentsrsquo arguments canrsquot just be a reasonable dference of opinion, or even mistaken, but must be deliberate hoods motivated by wickedness and malice for their own sake, what can you blame Step forward, targeted advertising. The department-store entrepreneur John Wanamaker, a pioneer of merchandising, was said to have claimed: ldquoHalf the money I spend on advertising is wasted the trouble is I donrsquot know which half.

Those companies may have access to huge amounts of data about us, but then so do supermarket loyalty card schemes. Anyone who fails to grasp that a benefit with no obvious cost to the consumer means that the consumer is the product doesnrsquot understand the digital age. Indeed, it was well-known years earlier: itrsquos why over-s le cover is advertised on daytime TV, ads for highly competitive brands like ketchup and chocolate feature on primetime soaps, and luxury cars are promoted during blockbuster films.Companies like Cambridge Analytica, or think-tanks, or political campaigns or parties may be snake-oil salesmen, or effective purveyors of such information, though it seems unlikely that theyrsquore both at once. Evenit were both, it would hardly make them Franz Mesmer or Derren Brown, any more than the undoubted and illegal attempts by Russia to spread misinformation guarantees the creation of some kind of Manchurian electorate.Criminal attempts to misuse data, or break electoral rules, should be investigated and,well founded, prosecuted. But most such claims so far have been feeble the courts recently concluded that trying to sue Boris Johnson for ldquolying in public office, and prosecuting a Vote Leave activist for a minor technical infringement were risible abuses of process, and threw them out.Political campaigns naturally present their arguments in the best light the Pollyanna claims of Leave were no more ldquolies than the doomsday predictions of Remain. Itrsquos as silly to complain that the independence referendumrsquos Project Fear somehow hypnotised the public as it would be to argue that Alex Salmond should be sued for having based his optimistic figures on an oil price four or five times higher than it turned out to be.These are political messages that should be challenged by political means. The correct rebuttal to theclaim that the EU costs pound million a week is not to maintain those saying so are a criminal conspiracy, but to show voters the sums and arguments against. Anything  is as silly as suing Carlsberg for claiming they produce ldquothe best lager in the world.Itrsquos equally daft to think thatyour opponents find a more successful system of identying possible supporters, and messages to which they are receptive, than traditional doorstep canvassing or billboards, it makes digital advertising Svengali-style brainwashing.

Massive, once-a-century change is easier to say than to do, but it seems clear that we do sit at the nexus of what may be the biggest political realignment of our lives. On the face of it, the Liberal Democrats are in a prime position to exploit that realignment and become its biggest beneficiary.The fact that people are even talking about it is something of a miracle for a party which was thought of as being clinically dead. The leadership of Vince Cable, notwithstanding the fact he is a perfectly able man with a good record in government and opposition, was, to test the boundaries of the meaning of the word, lsquoquietrsquo.However, an event ndash Brexit ndash has brought the party back to le, and the election of the energetic Jo Swinson has pumped more adrenaline into it. There are parallels here to the Scottish Tory party, which was finished until the event of the Scottish independence referendum gave it a reason to exist. The Lib Dems have become the party of Remain the Scottish Tories did the same with Unionism.

There is a reason why the Scottish Tories talk about a second independence referendum as much as, or more than, the SNP. They need it. It is the foundation for their single-issue campaign, which has already stretched across three Scottish and UK general elections, to great success, and is about to encompass another, in . Without the second independence referendum, and the ability to whip the unionist vote into a frenzy, what do the Scottish Tories have  Not much, in truth. A set of good, competent people, who would be perfectly able to run a government, but no policy  to make wavering voters ndash the lsquomaybesrsquo ndash feel compelled to tick the box with the C-word in it.Herein lies the lesson for Jo Swinson. The Liberal Democrats, today, is a single issue party. It is a party of Remain, setting itself apart from two parties of Leaveand Labour, a party with a pro-Leave leader who occasionally nods to a change of direction to keep the inhabitants of the tent inside.But, hard as it is to believe today, the Brexit issue is going to go away, and when it does there needs to be something to fall back on. This is precisely the trap that The Independent Group, or Change UK, fell into, andthe Scottish Tory analogy is too far from home for Ms Swinson to contemplate, perhaps this one is easier.Change UK formed with the twin aim of becoming an enduring party of government and stopping Brexit, but reality slapped them in the face with swt, ruthless aggression. You canrsquot be both. You canrsquot be a narrow single-issue party which welcomes only pro-second referendum Remainers and simultaneously be wide enough to be an enduring party of government.So, perverse as this may sound for a party with a hand on the shoulder of  per cent of the population, the success of Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems is not about Brexit.

Willie Rennie, Ms Swinsonrsquos Scottish counterpart, is further from power, but also has an opportunity to exploit a gap in the market. Arguably, his position is even more unique.

The lack of unormity is a source of confusion to many householders.Secondly, as Forbes Connor, Managing Director of Changeworks Recycling observes, Chinarsquos willingness to take co-mingled waste, which ended in January last year, provided some councils with an easy, low cost solution.Co-mingled waste, also called mixed dry waste, was collected in mixed stream recycle bins. The idea was that recyclable materials like glass, plastics, paper and cardboard could all be put in one bin. These would then be hand sorted at purpose-built Materials Recycling Facilities .What became clear, however, is that co-mingling waste contaminates and degrades the quality of the streams. Johan Sundblad, Managing Director of SAICA Natur UK Ltd, one of the largest materials recycling companies, says: ldquoIt is very hard to use mechanical means to sort co-mingled paper, cans and glass to the required quality levels, so councils are now having to go back  years to proper sorting at source. However, households in Scotland do not yet have a great track record in producing clean streams.It just takes a small amount of food or other contaminants in a paper stream to render it useless for anything except incineration, he says. Segregated waste streams required a lot more effort and initial expense from councils as far as the collection effort was concerned.Once China closed its doors, the writing was on the wall for co-mingled waste.On the positive side, Sundblad says public and business awareness of the importance of recycling has probably never been higher. ldquoThe vast majority of us are now focused on the impact we have on the environment. There is a lot of work still to do, but the level of public awareness is very encouraging, he says.Streets Ahead : Nursery kids clean up cityIn a recent report, the BBC looked at the recycling rules of five of Scotlandrsquos largest councils, East Renfrewshire, West Lothian, Clackmannanshire, Moray and Inverclyde.Big dferences emerged as to what could and could not be recycled at the kerbside depending on which council one was in.The report highlighted dferences such as some councils being willing to accept glass collections at the kerbside, while others required householders to use community glass recycling collection points. A few councils, such as West Lothian accept plastic carrier bags for recycling, others donrsquot.New research finds single-use packaging adds poundm a year to Scots shopping billsHelensburgh, for instance, had paper, cardboard, cans and plastic all going into the same blue bin. Another example of the gulf between the Scottish Governmentrsquos ambitions and the ability of Scottish councils to fulfil those ambitions, can be seen from the way the councils have responded to the governmentrsquos proposed  ban on domestic ldquoblack bag refuse going to landfill. The idea behind the ban is to further accelerate the ldquocircular economy concept and to prevent more than a million tonnes of household rubbish a year from winding up in landfill sites.However, according to the local authority body, Cosla, the message from Scottish councils is that they are very unlikely to be in a position to comply with the ban by the January ,  deadline. To do so would mean building a number of waste-to-heat incineration facilities to deal with whatever rubbish remains after households have stepped up their recycling reuse efforts.lsquoRadical actionrsquo now required to raise Scotlandrsquos recycling ratesMany councils are now building or planning to build these facilities, but there will not be sufficient capacity in Scotland by January .The ban means that no landfill operators in Scotland will be able to accept biodegradable municipal waste, which is to say, waste that can undergo aerobic or anaerobic decomposition. This includes food waste, garden rubbish, paper, cardboard and packaging, and textiles.Construction and demolition waste is excluded from the ban.Councils can hardly complain that the government has sprung this deadline on them. The ban was initially proposed as part of the WasteRegulations , and has been a signicant plank in the governmentrsquos Zero Waste Plan, which dates back to .

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

It was by no means certain they would get it – with  per cent having their requests turned down – and the average payout was £. One of the main reasons for applications was that people had spent their benefits or income and run out of money.Everyone has a personal responsibility to live within their means and the state simply cannot afford to fund the lestyles of prodigal citizens who refuse to do so and there is always likely to be a small minority of claimants who try to game the system. But the vast majority of cases will be genuine.: Boris Johnson tries to turn focus from Brexit with pledges to boost northern EnglandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereEver since the  crash, there has been growing concern about in-work poverty with some employers paying below the ‘living wage’ – effectively relying on their staff to claim ‘top-up’ benefits, which could be seen as a form of state subsidy for people’s wages, or get a second or even a third job.The growing discontent about standards of living – not just among the poorest – is a serious problem that must be addressed by politicians of all parties. The failure to do so was undoubtedly one reason for the Brexit referendum result. Boris Johnson’s announcement in Manchester of £. billion for ‘left-behind towns’ may be seen as a populist move, but it was at least a recognition of the need for action. The mere acknowledgement that some places have been “left behind” will be welcomed by many who feel exactly this way.But, ultimately, this is a serious problem that is unlikely to be solved by major spending projects by government – whether at Holyrood or Westminster – but by improving the economic performance of the country as a whole. And governments – at local, Scottish and UK level – have a vital role to play in ensuring this happens and duty to co-operate with each other to this end.So it was disappointing that the immediate reaction to the Welfare Fund figures was an attempt to sht blame. Our politicians need to work together to solve this country’s problems, whether they are ones of high finance or more mundane concerns, like the cost of nappies for an infant.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"what scottish unionists can learn from decline of quebec s separatists murdo fraser","story":"Quebec demonstrates that it is possible for unionists to see off an independence movement evenit seems unstoppable, writes Murdo Fraser.It is always useful to look at international and historical comparisons for the challenges we face in Scotland today. One part of the world that has faced similar constitutional issues to ours is the largely Francophone province of Quebec, which held two referendums on the question of independence , in  and . Whilst on both occasions the vote went against separation, in  it did so by the tightest of margins, with just one per cent between the winning and losing totals.Since , however, the notion of independence for Quebec has slipped down the political agenda, with a collapse in support both for it as a concept, and for the separatist Parti Quebecois.In the most recent provincial election last October, the once-dominant PQ secured just  per cent of the vote, with the winner being the soft-nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec .What explains this turnaround in little more than  years  Simply, Quebecers tired of the constitutional argument. A younger generation in the province, still proud of their Quebec heritage, became more comfortable with the notion of being Canadian, secure in the view that a strong federal system protected local decision-making.There is little doubt that the constitutional debates had an economic impact. The banking centre of Canada moved from Montreal to Toronto, largely due to concerns over Quebec separation. A legacy of those times is the irony that today the Bank of Montreal is headquartered not in the city whose name it bears, but in English-speaking Toronto.The debate over Quebec’s future had consequences too for the local electoral landscape. With a first-past-the-post voting system, there was little point in the federalist, pro-Canada parties splitting the anti-separatist vote any more than was necessary. : Nicola Sturgeon challenges Boris Johnson to live TV debate on independenceFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo the Conservative Party of Canada, despite its electoral successes at a federal level, does not contest elections to the Quebec National Assembly. Instead, Quebec Conservatives vote for the Quebec Liberal Party, which despite its name has been independent of the Canadian Liberals – the party of Justin Trudeau – since , and sits somewhat to their right on economic issues.These arrangements are perhaps best illustrated in the long career of the Quebec politician Jean Charest. Charest started his journey as a Conservative in Canada’s federal Parliament in Ottawa, serving as leader of the party there from  to . Then, on the invitation of the Quebec Liberals, he left the federal Parliament – and the Canada Conservatives – to become the provincial Liberal leader, in which position he went on to be elected as Premier of Quebec. He served in that role from -, winning an unprecedented three election victories.While the notion of dferent political parties at dferent levels might seem unusual to us, it is the norm across Canada. Centre-right, pro-Canada Quebecers have no dficulty in voting one way in a federal election, and quite dferently in a provincial one.So what might we in Scotland learn from all this  Firstly, there is nothing inevitable about independence or constitutional change. It might have seemed to Quebecers in the s that nothing would stop the separatist juggernaut, but the voters simply tired of the constitutional debate.Voter fatigue is something we are becoming familiar with. My sense of where we are with Brexit is that there is a growing demand that politicians “just get it over with”. There is little appetite to re-open the independence question here while the Brexit question is still unresolved, and even then I wonder whether the public will be enthusiastic about yet another round of constitutional debate.Secondly, we should not assume that our current political party structures are either optimal, or set to last for ever. Boris Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister has reignited the debate over whether there should be a separate Scottish Conservative Party, an idea I put forward in  when I stood for the party leadership .Notwithstanding my views on the issue at that time, to me the notion that we should split from the Conservative Party as a reaction to Boris’s election as UK leader is as daft an idea as the SNP’s claim that this is an argument for independence. The Union has lasted for more than  years, it has been substantially to the benefit of Scotland to have been part of it for that time, both economically and socially, and to dismantle it as a knee-jerk response to the identity of any one holder of the office of Prime Minister, and lose these advantages as a consequence, would be ridiculous.Moreover,Boris can deliver an orderly Brexit, he may well end up governing the UK as a true One-Nation Conservative. A look at his record in office as mayor of London suggests that is entirely possible, and some of his early announcements – for example on dropping his predecessor’s misguided immigration targets – have been warmly welcomed by Scottish Conservatives.I understand the concerns of Conservative colleagues who don’t want to change our relationship with the UK party. I also appreciate that I have MP colleagues who want to be part of a bigger team, and feel that their constituents should have the right to vote directly for the party of Government in a Westminster election. But,we were to adopt a Canadian model of political parties, that would all still be possible. The key battleground ahead for us is  – the Scottish Parliament elections – where a victory for the SNP with a majority of seats at Holyrood for pro-independence parties will lead to them claiming a mandate for a second referendum. The priority for unionists, of all parties, must be to defeat them in that objective.The lesson of politics in Quebec is that when the forces of federalism come together they can see off the threat of separation. If it worked there, it could work here. At least we should be considering whether the Canadian approach is one we can learn from.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tory brexit blamed by snp as pound plunges to 28 month low","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Boris Johnsons strategy of escalating the threat of a no-deal Brexit has led to the value of the pound plunging to a -month low, the SNP warned today.Sterling is currently headed for its worst month since October , when Theresa May announced her intention to trigger Article  ahead of the UKs exit from the European Union.The pound dropped below . against the US dollar this week and fell sharply against the euro to below €. on the international currency markets.SNP MP Patricia Gibson warned that Scottish holidaymakers now faced paying the price of the UK Government’s \"damaging\" Brexit strategy.But Tory MP Robert Halfon suggested the fall in the pound could benefit exporters and help British tourism, while City analysts suggested the plunging pound was the result of the market coming to terms with Mr Johnson entering No .: Scottish MPs call for tarfs and migrant plans to be ripped up“With the summer holiday season in full swing, the plunge in the value of the pound to a staggering -month low as a result of Brexit is a blow to Scottish holidaymakers as they face higher costs when exchanging currencies and preparing for their holidays with families and friends,\" Ms Gibson, the Nationalists constitutional affairs spokeswoman, said.“The Tories’ assault on people’s pockets and living standards has been ramped up as Boris Johnson pushes ahead with his catastrophic Brexit plans, which Scotland did not vote for and which we know will leave us all poorer and worse off.“Rather than reversing the damaging consequences Brexit is already having - before the UK has even left the EU - the Tories’ flippant response by saying holidaymakers might stay in the UK instead of exploring dferent countries and cultures just shows how out of touch the Tories are.\"Former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said he was concerned the pound will fall further as traders wake up to the prospect of a no-deal exit in three months’ time.\"The markets already factored it in to some extent, but the potential for a continuing fall in currency is all too apparent,” he told Bloomberg.Petr Krpata, an analyst with City bank ING warned that investors were now coming to terms with Mr Johnsons Premiership. “The market [is] awaking to the reality of a new UK government, its rather combative stance on the current EU-UK Brexit deal, and its open remarks on the rising probability of a no-deal Brexit,\" he told .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer.Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.One person treated by emergency services after dramatic Lough Neagh rescue - jet ski not seen for more than two hours Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"“Hopefully we will see their numbers increase and get a sustainable population, with four or five pairs regularly breeding, and this feels more achievable after this landmark year. Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great. It shows us we must be doing something right for them. The way we farm, we’re sensitive to nature and the birds and we try to do whatever we can to help.”After the second brood hatches later this month, the birds will migrate back to Africa in August or September.Corncrakes are easily spooked, so members of the public are asked not to try and get close to the birdsthey hear their call as they are on private land and it is also important that the birds are not disturbed and that this sensitive conservation effort is not compromised.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2023362.jpg--.jpg?1563964433000\n","title":"vintage and heritage festival in carnlough","story":"Carnlough Vintage Society will host their th Vintage Rally and Heritage day on Saturday, August .

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry. The Irish Arts Centre in New York came to see it in the Lyric and there is talk of taking it over to the States for the Irish Arts Festival in February.”Gerard continued: “If people with tickets for the s Night which is happening as part of Féile want to come to the show first, then we wanted to put it out in the Andersonstown News that they can get a ticket half pricethey show their ticket at the door or contact us via sodabreadtheatre@gmail – we can give them a code when booking.“We are really looking forward to bringing the piece to the Devenish and hearing people’s reaction to the work.”A Night in November will be performed at the Devenish Complex on Sunday, August .

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres.

DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from.

Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts.

Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic.

There were  children in our house, a sure sign you were from the Falls during the s, and St Peter’s Brass and Reed Band and St Paul’s Silver Band featured prominently in our lives.Members of St Peter’s Brass and Reed were affiliated with the Irish Free State Army where they were assigned to the Infantry so they could play in the Army Band. With names like Johnny McCorry, Pat Campbell, Fr Montague et al teaching them the ropes,it was no wonder that most of the Morgan brothers like Pat, Tony and Tom went on to make music a big part of their lives. Tony was a member of ious swing and brass bands while Tom, Pat and his we Ann started The Ballymurphy Martyrs Flute Band which then split to form Éire Nua. Another band on that scene were the Tom Williams Pipers, I’m sure our readers know more.Trombones and French horns, tubas and clarinets were all over our Beechmount house, with band unorms hanging over doors and music stands taking up precious space. We were all encouraged to learn an instrument as our clarinet-playing father Paddy Morgan thoughtwe were ever out of work, especially being Catholic, we could always busk and have our music to fall back on.During the late s through to  our Tom was in a band called ‘The Livin’ Thing’ named after Seamy and Roy Cassidy’s love of ELO. Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just .

Punters zip-lined over kayakers and SUPers on the lake. Whoops spilled from the Wild Water Rapids. Activities booked ranged from Bollywood dancing to indoor bowling.Lodges smelled new. Hundreds of little orange wasp-catching devices dangled from trees, and the accents of experienced UK staff could be heard all over - from the water slides to restaurants - helping their Irish colleagues settle in.\"This is probably the quickest we’ve built a park.

We know that parents rely on the continued operation of services in order to go to work every day.“Closing down a service at short notice can cause enormous inconvenience to families.”Pat Smyth, interim chief executive at Tusla, the child and family agency.Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone has asked her officials to review regulatory powers nationally and internationally to find outTusla has sufficient powers, particularly those required to close services immediately where a threshold of poor standards have been crossed.Committee chairman Alan Farrell asked how can they be “absolutely certain” practices observed at Hyde  Seek were “isolated incidents”.Brian Lee, Tusla’s director of quality assurance, said: “Our overriding principle is to drive improvement in the sector but you can never get a cast-iron guarantee that something like that will never happen again, but by having a robust inspection model, by people complying with ious other quality initiatives, it reduces the likelihood of anything like that happening signicantly.“One power that would be a huge help is when a service is operating unregistered that we can actually act to have them closed immediately.“At the moment we can only request and then move to actually prosecute the service.“If the service is not registered with Tusla the only recourse we have is to write to them to desist, which they can chose to ignore and the next power is to proceed with prosecution, but we can only deregister a service that is registered with us.“At the moment Tusla has no statutory legal basis to contact parentswe have concerns, and it is a gap and we are looking into ways that could be addressed.”Pat Smyth, interim chief executive at Tusla, added: “We have the power to deregister, they can still operate in business, we don’t have the power to close it.”The appalling mistreatment of children and the terrible management practices were unacceptable and inexcusableBernie McNally, Department of Children and Youth AffairsThe committee was also told about the importance of members of the public speaking out and reporting any issues.Fine Gael Senator Catherine Noone queried whether CCTV equipment could be installed in creches around the country.Ms McNally said: “Whilst it does seem like a good solution and it is an option, we don’t do it in classrooms, we do have to look at the pros and cons of it.“We do have to look at the rights of all of the children.“Is it something that has to be discussed further  Yes.”The committee also heard Ms McNally describe the investigation into the standard of care at the creches as “deeply distressing”.She added: “The appalling mistreatment of children and the terrible management practices were unacceptable and inexcusable.“I know that Tusla, in collaboration with the gardai and the fire safety authorities, are pursuing those responsible.“We are working intensively to improve quality in services and to ensure that there is robust regulation.“We believe that Hyde  Seek does not represent the standard of care and education offered by the , services.”Mr Smyth also told the Oireachtas committee the behaviour towards children and the serious breaches of regulations at Hyde  Seek creches were “shocking, unacceptable and worrying”.He added: “The behaviours displayed are unlikely to be evident during an inspection and we rely on good professional practice and appropriate mandatory reporting under Children First, or through Tusla’s Unsolicited Information Office for the notication of child protection concerns.”"},{"url":null,"title":"rare harry

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors. PBP Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced his support for all “necessary action”.NIPSA representative Ruaidhri O’Sandair had one final message for the department of Finance, “Sue Gray, where’s our pay ”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys new holiday inn express officially opens doors","story":"Derry’s newest hotel officially opened its doors for business yesterday and in the process brought with it over  jobs.The Holiday Inn Express on the city’s Strand Road represents a £ million investment in the city and the chain’s owners, Intercontinental Hotels Group , have said its presence will not just enhance employment but will create business opportunities for service providers across the region as well as in Derry city centre.With  bedroom’s the new hotel is now the second largest in the city and as well as having all the state-of-the-art facilities associated with modern hotels its central location is within walking distance of all the city’s main tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.General Manager Stephen Redden said that he is confident the new hotel will add to the vibrancy of the Strand Road and act as a compliment to existing and emerging businesses.“We are delighted to open the doors and add a fresh dimension to the city’s accommodation.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"happy hounds camera club stars national dog photography day powys","story":"My Border Collie Skye when we first moved to Builth Wells five years ago,ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtquot says Mick Plesltspan classtruncate-full-screengtzkan.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysRecent favourites of my two gorgeous boys for Dog Photography Day, sltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtays Tammy Stretton.lt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysRecent favourites of my two gorgeous boys for Dog Photography Day, sltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtays Tammy Stretton.lt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysTollie having a laugh for National Dog Photography Day from Toni Manltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtnell. lt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysInkie in the bluebells along the Pont Llogel walk from Toni Mannell for Nationalltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Dog Photography Dayltspan classtruncate-full-screengt.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysRescue dog Dougal was editor Nick Knight#s trusty companion over just about ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtall of the Welsh hilltspan classtruncate-full-screengtls and mountains over many years.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"powys new head education appointed","story":"Dr Caroline Turner the new chief executive of Powys County Council, takes the heltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlm on February .lt spangtlt spangt\" POWYS: Has new head of education been appointed Head of education, Dr Alec Clark\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"removing complication","story":"Be more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitBe more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitGet your training off to a great start with this special offer.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"burglary llanidloes see hear anything","story":"Library image of police tape\" Burglary in Llanidloes – did you see or hear anything Library image of police tape\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
