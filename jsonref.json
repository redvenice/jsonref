The suite next occupant\u0027s was the Mail\u0027s own Robert HardmanDavid Cameron was still in Downing Street and the England football team were revving up for another dismal performance at the European championships when Jose Mourinho first checked in to this gaudily opulent suite in Manchester’s Lowry Hotel.This week, 895 days later, ‘the Special One’ — as he likes to call himself — has finally checked out. Having been summarily dumped as manager of Manchester United Football Club, the mercurial 55-year-old has now vacated the Lowry’s Riverside Suite and a new occupant has moved in: me.I have not even unpacked before I start to wonder why anyone would want to live in a place like this for a month, let alone two-and-a-half years. It might be five-star luxury of the shiniest, blingiest sort — and we all know how that appeals to the footballing fraternity — but there are only so many plumped-up cushions, room-service breakfasts, spa treatments and fluffy bathrobes that a man can endure.As one of football’s grandest grandees, Mourinho will have been offered the finest hacienda-style villas and mock-Georgian piles that Cheshire’s leafy footballer belt has to offer. He could have had his own swimming pool, solarium, snooker room and cinema in the depths of Hale or Alderley Edge.And yet he chose to leave his family behind in their London home and lead a pampered but solitary, soulless existence amid the eternal building site that is city centre Salford. It is hardly private. And it was anything but cheap.           I have not even unpacked before I start to wonder why anyone would want to live in a place like this for a month, let alone two-and-a-half years... There are only so many plumped-up cushions, room-service breakfasts, spa treatments and fluffy bathrobes that a man can endure We can but wonder at the size of Mourinho’s bill, which has been calculated at somewhere between £500,000 and £800,000, depending on the Lowry’s fluctuating room rates. If he was getting the same online deal as me, he would have clocked up a bill of £618,445. And that’s just for the room.At £22.50 on top for breakfast (amazingly, it is not included in the price), £75 for a bottle of Mourinho’s favourite Tuscan wine and even £2.95 for a mini-pack of Pringles from the kitchen-sized minibar, it’s safe to say that his extras will have added a further £100,000 or so to the tab.It will have been even higher if the well-groomed Portuguese smoothie was a regular at the hotel spa (where a ‘High Performance Skin Energiser For Men’ will set you back £70 a time).          The lounge area of the suite in the Lowry Hotel where Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho lived for two yearsAfter two-and-a-half years in charge of Britain’s most famous football club, Mourinho is now jobless and back at the family home in Belgravia.Things, though, are not so very different here at the Lowry since no sooner had he checked out on Tuesday than his replacement, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, checked in on Wednesday. Following his sudden appointment as manager, the 45-year-old Norwegian abandoned his job as the manager of tiny Molde, with its 11,000-seat stadium half-way between Oslo and the Arctic Circle, and flew by private jet to Manchester to take charge at 75,000-seat Old Trafford.He may have replaced the Special One in the United dugout, but he will not be taking over his bed.The hotel management, understandably, refuse to discuss their guests but I learn that Solskjaer has asked for a different Riverside Suite (there are six identical ones). Footballers can be very superstitious and who can blame the new man for not wanting the same room as his predecessor? Besides, the Norwegian cannot have the sixth-floor penthouse Riverside Suite, where Mourinho is reported to have stayed, for the simple reason that, tonight, I am in residence.          There is a pristine kitchen with espresso machine, every sort of tea and a microwave — not that anyone staying in here is likely to want to heat up a ready-meal when 24-hour room service is but a call away (£15.50 for a burger)So, what did Mourinho get for his £691-a-night? I have a panoramic view of the thin, Bovril-black River Irwell through the floor-to-ceiling windows which run the full length of my two huge interconnecting rooms — 735 square feet overall.Whether I am wallowing in my giant L-shaped scarlet sofa in the dining-cum-conference room or lying in the king-sized bed next door, I can watch one of two hefty flatscreen televisions. Or stare out at the Manchester skyline or simply admire myself in the vast mirrored double doors which connect the two rooms. I wonder which the Special One enjoyed doing most.There is a pristine kitchen with espresso machine, every sort of tea and a microwave — not that anyone staying in here is likely to want to heat up a ready-meal when 24-hour room service is but a call away (£15.50 for a burger).          The spacious suite has a bedroom, lounge area, kitchen and walk-in wardrobes but these doors wouldn\u0027t close properlyThere are two walk-in wardrobes large enough for the most incurable shopaholic, a bathroom and shower, plus an additional guest loo. You certainly can’t fault the generosity of the chambermaids. There are dozens of little pots of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and so on. If Mourinho decided to tip this lot in to his luggage on a daily basis, the family would never buy another bar of soap.The five-star Lowry was welcomed as the shiny centrepiece of a grand Mancunian revival when it opened 17 years ago, just in time for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.These days, however, there are signs of wear and tear. During my stay, the DVD player doesn’t work (maybe the Special One threw the remote control at the wall watching replays of last week’s defeat against Liverpool). The telephone in the diningconference room is broken and the kitchen fridge is on the blink, too. My half bottle of Perrier-Jouet (£35 on the bill should I pop the cork) sits in a cold-ish puddle of water.    Whether I am wallowing in my giant L-shaped scarlet sofa in the dining-cum-conference room or lying in the king-sized bed next door, I can watch one of two hefty flatscreen televisions          The two ends of the suite are illustrated by fiery, volcanic impressions of the Calder Valley by Oldham-born artist, Alan Rankle. It is all very contemporary and very striking, though after more than two years of waking up to this stuff, one might yearn for something a little more homelyLying in bed, my eye is caught by old strips of black gaffer tape stuck to the curtain pelmet and the grand double doors to the bedroom won’t shut properly.I can’t open the windows even an inch, so have to rely on a rumbling air conditioning unit. Still, at least I’m spared a chocolate on the pillow.The decor might be described as a modernist Man Utd homage — lots of red and white with strips of black here and there. Only the Christmas tree breaks the colour code.A huge illustrated encyclopaedia called The Big Book Of Chic sits on a coffee table to reassure me that this is all in the best possible taste. The only magazines in here are Tatler and World Of Interiors (nothing about football). The two ends of the suite are illustrated by fiery, volcanic impressions of the Calder Valley by Oldham-born artist, Alan Rankle. It is all very contemporary and very striking, though after more than two years of waking up to this stuff, one might yearn for something a little more homely.          The Portuguese manager had the use of a private dining room at The Lowry during his 30-month stay in the Manchester hotel          Since I am living the Mourinho dream, I want the Special One’s speciality. It’s an elegant, oaky red which goes well with one of his preferred steak dishes  The 42oz ‘Tomahawk’ steak from Cheshire costs £85 for two to share and is served on a wooden board with three sauces          The menu in the Lowry\u0027s dining room includes an £18 starter of Wagyu beef and an 8oz fillet steak - yours for £36          Apparently, Mourinho was particularly partial to the duck pancakes and big, shared beef dishes, along with full-bodied wines like the 2013 Castello Vicchiomaggio Ripa delle More Toscana at £75 a bottle.I can’t imagine what Salford’s most famous son, Laurence Stephen Lowry, would have made of this bling-filled palace bearing his name. Quite apart from the fact that he was a lifelong fan of United’s arch-rivals, Manchester City, he was famous for his gritty scenes of working-class life either side of the war and for his ‘matchstick’ figures massed outside factories and football grounds.The only matchstick figures around here are likely to be those pushing a manicured lettuce leaf around a plate down in the chi-chi first-floor River Restaurant. Not that Mourinho was much of a salad man. Apparently, he was particularly partial to the duck pancakes and big, shared beef dishes, along with full-bodied wines like the 2013 Castello Vicchiomaggio Ripa delle More Toscana at £75 a bottle.Since I am living the Mourinho dream, I want the Special One’s speciality. It’s an elegant, oaky red which goes well with one of his preferred steak dishes, a 42oz ‘Tomahawk’ from Cheshire (£85 for two — with three sauces).Among the local in-crowd whom I talk to, everyone seems to have spotted Mourinho coming in here at some point, usually with a small group of football folk. As one of the most famous faces in this football-mad city, he would find it more congenial to eat in the private dining room off to one side. At least there he could chew his Tomahawk without being stared at.    Black gaffer tape along the curtain rail, a leaky fridge and a broken DVD player took the edge off the luxurious experienceAll of which raises the question of why he chose to live in this very expensive goldfish bowl in the first place. Other players and managers have traditionally based themselves in leafy Cheshire. If Solskjaer takes on the job permanently (he is currently a ‘caretaker’ manager) he will doubtless do the same. As I check out, I bump into a Norwegian television crew checking in. Different goldfish, same bowl.The Lowry staff, all extremely smart and pleasant, are far too discreet to discuss their longest-lasting resident, beyond saying he will be ‘missed’.Mourinho always has enjoyed breaking the mould. I trust they haven’t charged him for breaking the DVD player."},{"url":null,"title":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reveals 20 shows watch Christmas","story":"    Claire Foy as the Queen and Matt Smith  as Prince Philip in The Crown on NetflixA deeply detailed, sometimes irreverent script by Peter Morgan reveals the inner lives of the Royal Family as well as the political skulduggery and sexual scandals.Claire Foy and Matt Smith are breathtakingly good as the Queen and her often disaffected husband, Prince Philip — they have to be, or they risk being outshone by a cast that includes Victoria Hamilton as the Queen Mum, Pip Torrens as the conniving private secretary, Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret and a host more.Next year promises to bring a third season, with Olivia Colman as the Queen, Helena Bonham Carter as her sister and, among many more, Emerald Fennell as Camilla Parker Bowles.

It’s full of sardonic Communist slogans, delivered with a subversive cynicism.‘At times like this,’ growls the maverick policeman Gregor (voiced by Channing Tatum), ‘I ask myself, “What would Lenin do?”’ — before beating a suspect to a pulp.If you loved the time-travel cop drama Ashes To Ashes, I promise you will be instantly hooked on Comrade Detective.Although filmed with Romanian actors, there are no subtitles but the dubbing is done by a host of Hollywood A-listers. The standout star is Kim Basinger as a man-eating American ambassador.The Grand TourJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, doing what they did on Top Gear for donkey’s years, only with a bigger budget now they have moved to Amazon. A much bigger budget. Easily the most expensive car show ever.  Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson, and James May train withSpecial Forces in Jordan. The Grand Tour will launch exclusively for Amazon Prime customers this AutumnThe Man In The High CastleThe third series of this unsettling drama, based on the award-winning sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick, arrived with little fanfare this autumn. It imagines an America after the Nazis won the war (by nuking Washington). With Rufus Sewell as a fascist police chief and Alexa Davalos as a double agent, the story swirls in psychedelic circles for 30 episodes without ever really going anywhere. But once you’re hooked, it’s hard to stop watching.The Marvellous Mrs MaiselAfter its launch last year, this comedy-drama about a Fifties housewife who decides to become a stand-up comic made a triumphant return.This is one of those highly acclaimed critical successes that epitomise today’s era of superlative TV. Honestly, why would you pay to go to the movies and miss out on this? Rachel Brosnahan is a joy as Midge, the orcee who exacts revenge on her unfaithful ex-husband by taking to the comedy stage and doing what he always dreamt of doing, but far better.           Rachel Brosnahan as Midge in The Marvellous Mrs Maisel.

The boys all have Greek middle names in honour of their grandfather Elia Stratis who died in Lockerbie Every year the family make the trip, one made particularly poignant on the 30th anniversary by the fact that their eldest son Joshua is now seven, the same age Sonia was when she lost her father.But what makes their visit even more remarkable is that the family are there to remember not just one victim of the Lockerbie bombing, but two.Sonia and her husband Chris were brought together by the disaster. Sonia lost her father, Chris\u0027s stepmother lost her husband. Ten years ago they met at a memorial dinner for families of the victims, fell in love and married. That their joy has come through such shared heartbreak and grief has proved bittersweet for them both. \u0027Two men died in order for Chris and myself to know each other and come together,\u0027 says Sonia.\u0027A few years ago I remember talking to my mother, through many tears, about how she lost her husband in order for me to meet mine. I grieved for her loss in a new way with that realisation. But I am still so thankful for the three full little lives that have come from this loss.\u0027Today, accessories designer Sonia, 37, is a happy, vibrant, stay-at-home mum to three rambunctious young boys: Joshua, seven, Lucian, five, and Giovanni, two. The family live in Williamsburg, Virginia, where Chris works as an executive film producer.           Sonia\u0027s husband Chris was raised with a stepmother and three step-siblings who had been deeply affected by the tragedy: his step-mother\u0027s first husband William Daniels died in the crashChris\u0027s father Russ had married Kathy Daniels, whose husband William had been killed at Lockerbie, when Chris was in his early teens.Raised with a stepmother and three step-siblings who had been deeply affected by the tragedy, Chris understood the grief that comes with losing a loved one in a terrorist attack, and like many of the US victims\u0027 relatives, the two families had become close.Yet until that night, Chris and Sonia had never met. Chris says there was an \u0027instant chemistry\u0027. Sonia says he made her laugh, and that his jokes \u0027made me happy during what was usually a serious time\u0027.\u0027I had known his stepfamily for years. We spent time talking that night along with his stepbrother and another fellow who had lost his father on the flight. After that we started talking on the phone.\u0027Trips between Boston and New York where the two lived followed, and they quickly fell in love.\u0027Chris knew how to deal with my pain over Lockerbie because he had grown up with people affected by it,\u0027 says Sonia.\u0027I felt safe sharing that side of me. I didn\u0027t feel like I was going to be judged. Other people in my life – both friends and boyfriends – have said things like, \u0027Why can\u0027t you get over this?\u0027 A lot of people just don\u0027t know what to say, so they say the wrong things.\u0027The couple were engaged less than 18 months later. Their wedding, in August 2010, coincided with the first anniversary of the release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi from prison, a decision by the Scottish Government which many of the US victims\u0027 families vehemently disagreed with, including Sonia\u0027s mother, who stated that the relatives \u0027felt betrayed\u0027.None of it marred the couple\u0027s special day, however. Sonia walked down the aisle on her mother\u0027s arm holding a bouquet with her father\u0027s picture, so that he could be with her. \u0027I obviously missed my daddy walking me down the aisle and dancing with me, but my mother and I also have a special bond and we found a way to make it special for us while honouring my father,\u0027 she says.More than two dozen of the victims\u0027 relatives attended the wedding. Even President Barack Obama sent the couple a message of good luck, saying: \u0027Though the pain of your shared loss brought you together, your wedding marks a new beginning and the start of a lifelong partnership.\u0027Their union touched a nerve both with the families of the victims and with many other Americans, still reeling from the 911 attacks less than a decade earlier.\u0027I hope that people have found hope from our story,\u0027 says Sonia. \u0027I know that people we share it with personally have, and I hope that it can bring hope to others too. I love that something I have to share can bring hope to people.\u0027    A picture taken in Lockerbie on December 22, 1988, shows the wreckage of Pan Am flight 103 aircraft that exploded killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. Scottish prosecutors on October 15, 2015 said they had identified two new Libyan suspects in the bombing Sonia says that far from providing conflict, the disaster that brought them together has also brought them closer as a couple.\u0027Coming through a tragedy like this has forever marked our lives and our marriage. Sure, there are the deep scars, but there is also for us a grounding in knowing that good can come out of evil,\u0027 she says.\u0027So no matter how hard something can be in life or marriage, we are grounded in the truth that good can come from bad, life can come from death, hope can come out of hopelessness.\u0027It was something that particularly resonated when her eldest son Joshua turned seven last month. \u0027He is now the age I was when I lost my dad,\u0027 she says.\u0027In a way, it helps me to see myself in a new light. I realise seven is an age when you have a foundation of self and many formed memories, but also so much of life you\u0027ve not experienced yet. I\u0027m so thankful that Joshua has not experienced the loss I did at his age, and in a way he gets to retain a bit more innocence than I did when evil forced its way into my life and took my daddy.\u0027In common with many relatives of the US victims, the Stratis family felt that justice had been done when Megrahi was convicted.In 2015, Sonia\u0027s mother Mary Kay, who is chairman of the board of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, released a strongly worded statement regarding an appeal of the Libyan\u0027s conviction, which is currently being considered by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission and is backed by Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora at Lockerbie and has been a vocal supporter of Megrahi.\u0027While it will never really be \u0027over\u0027, she wrote, \u0027it is past time for Dr Swire and the Megrahi supporters to end their disgraceful and expensive campaign.\u0027Sonia is slightly more reticent about the review, which is expected to take several years.\u0027Above all I believe in truth and justice. Do I think that the whole truth has been brought to light? No. I do feel that the evidence presented in court was fairly compelling, but I definitely don\u0027t believe that\u0027s all there is to what happened.\u0027I hope that more can be uncovered and brought to light.\u0027Sonia and her mother have visited Lockerbie several times, and when the boys are older she plans to bring them to Scotland too. \u0027The few times I\u0027ve been, it\u0027s felt like going home in a way,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027d love to share that feeling with my boys.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to show them the beauty that is there, both in the setting, but also in the beautiful, kind, welcoming, comforting people.\u0027At last year\u0027s memorial service at Arlington, watching others lay flowers, Joshua collected some leaves and placed them by the name of the grandfather he never met. Then he found some more and placed them at Bill Daniels\u0027s name.It was a touching tribute from a little boy whose family was created out of unfathomable tragedy – the legacy of which is now bringing hope."},{"url":null,"title":"QUENTIN LETTS Andrea Leadsomes heroic digs enemy Bercow","story":"\u0027You are utterly obsessed with this\u0027: Angry Corbyn has...No Christmas truce in the Cabinet: Theresa May slaps down...Share this articleShe’s brave and she can react fast.

There’s a roaring fire and the place is decorated with quaint, and faintly freaky bric-a-brac (I can see a stuffed cat dressed in a Santa suit).‘I love eccentric London. Eccentric England,’ Patti said happily.She picked the venue, having enjoyed an arvo spread at the Zetter’s sister hotel in Marylebone.Tea isn’t such a big deal in the United States. ‘No, not at all,’ she agreed, before popping a glazed gammon and piccalilli delicacy into her mouth.‘We have breakfast, lunch and dinner. That’s it. How did this happen?!’ she asked as we go on to discuss the rules of taking tea and whether the jam goes on the scone before the cream and how thrilled she’d been, years ago, tasting clotted cream for the first time.‘The jam has to go on first, right? Otherwise you smash the cream?’ she said (she is correct, by the way, in my opinion).The idea for tea with Patti came when Chris Harper, business partner of Company’s celebrated director Marianne Elliott, mentioned in passing that many of the ‘boys’ from Company enjoy popping into the actress’s stage level dressing room.‘What we have are Patti’s Panderings,’ she said...the name given to the gatherings by Richard Fleeshman, who plays Andy, the dim but strapping flight attendant whom Bobbi wants to devour during a number called Barcelona.Patti explained that ‘the guys come into my dressing room between numbers, and at the end of the first act…there’s plenty of room — and their rooms are way up the stairs.’Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u0027s Superdog! Grinning...Inuits fear the curse of HMS Terror has been reawakened by...Share this articleShe and her esteemed dresser Murray Lane started feeding them. Apples with almond butter, and other tidbits. Ashley Campbell arrived one day with smoked salmon and cream cheese. George Blagden brought sausage rolls. Sometimes Patti picks up mini pork pies from a posh butcher in Holborn and serves them with chutney. A fruit course might include clementines and strawberries. ‘They’re only little nibbles,’ she said.‘We gossip, and everybody’s listening for the cue to go back on stage. It’s turned into this very sweet, wonderful bonding of the company. In my dressing room.’The Broadway legend said that ‘the guys have banned the women’ — though Mel Giedroyc shows up anyway.‘I don’t know why the women were banned,’ Patti mused. ‘If there’s anything left over, we give it to the girls.’With Christmas approaching ‘we’re going wild now’, she said, adding mince pies to the snacking menu.I told her that, in my opinion, the best are to be found at Maison Bertaux in Soho (I shall be leaving a few at the stage door for them).It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it.‘Usually with musicals I’m like: “When’s it’s going to end?” I’m already mourning the end of this one, because it’s a great experience.’And it’s a great show. I caught up with Company (for about the fourth or fifth time) a couple of days before our tea date, and every performance has deepened: Patti’s and Rosalie’s in particular.The Juilliard School-trained thespian clearly adores her co-star — and the whole of the company of Company — and is torn about repeating the role if the show plays on Broadway. Which I’m certain it will.She said she faced a similar dilemma when she played in the original cast of Les Miserables at the Barbican, where she created the role of Fantine. (She also played Norma Desmond in the original, West End production of Sunset Boulevard.)‘This is my company — I belong to this company,’ she said. ‘I had said that I’d never do another musical on Broadway. But I did this for Marianne, in London. I had no idea it would turn out to be this happy, incredible experience.’But doing it in New York? Starting in a new musical there would be ‘so complicated’. ‘You start your first rehearsal exhausted. You start the run exhausted.’And then there’s the acting...We discuss a revival of a play in New York which we both saw and both struggled to understand.‘I get told off about my diction but at this I was going “What did they say?!” I wanted to shout: “Slow down! Enunciate!!”’And the musical performances haven’t been much better. ‘I go: “Really? Really?! You call that a leading lady? You call that a leading man?” They don’t come across the footlights.’She noted that the great Ethel Merman (whom she never saw, live) could hit the theatre’s back wall without a microphone. A rare occurrence today.‘They’re forgetting how to P R O J E C T,’ she enunciated, with such command that hotel staff 20 yards away leapt to attention.‘Often they’re miscast, just because they had success on TV or something. They’re not successful, because they’re limited — because they don’t come across the footlights.‘I think people forget that they’re doing it for an audience, and that there’s more to it than learning the lines and singing as beautifully as you can.‘You have to want to do it. You have to have the technique to do it. You have to be fearless.’          \u0027It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it\u0027She went on to praise Rosalie Craig. ‘She makes me cry because I’ve seen women her age in musicals who have gotten great reviews and even won awards and I’ve gone “Why?”‘But watching Rosalie is different. She’s the essence of what a leading lady in musical theatre should be.’We paused, while she sampled more delights from ‘Aunt Wilhelmina’s’ menu (little sandwiches), and I tackled ‘Uncle Seymour’ (Scotch quail eggs, mini truffled sausage rolls).There were cakes, and two snowman Pavlovas, which we happily donated Jo Davidson, my long-suffering photographer.We could have carried on for hours, but five o’clock was fast approaching and Patti wanted to get to the Gielgud. Her progress to the door was slowed by a group of American actors at the next table, keen to fete her. And who could blame them.Here’s to the sensational lady … who drinks tea.   Ben\u0027s unlikely blonde ambitionSome like it hot, and Ben Whishaw is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe in a new play. Yes, that’s what I said.Whishaw will star in a new work by Anne Carson, the renowned classics professor and poet. ‘It’s called Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy,’ the actor told me. ‘Norma Jeane Baker was Monroe’s real name and the play’s about Marilyn Monroe — and I play her . . . sort of.’He added that the American soprano Renee Fleming will sing in the production, which is being directed by Katie Mitchell at The Shed, a new arts complex opening in Manhattan in the spring.  \u0027Some like it hot, and Ben Whishaw (left) is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe (right) in a new play. Yes, that’s what I saidWhishaw is on the big screen at the moment in the delightful Mary Poppins Returns — he plays grown up Michael Banks, with Emily Mortimer as his sister Jane. The magical nanny, deliciously played by Emily Blunt, returns to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane to help the siblings as much as Michael’s three young children.Whishaw sings in the Poppins film but stressed that he won’t in Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy.‘It’s about as far away from Mary Poppins as you could possibly go,’ he told me.Carson’s piece, partly spoken and partly sung, is based on the Greek tragedy of Helen, the beauty whose face launched a thousand ships. Scholars have tried before to link the allure of Monroe with the Ancient Greeks. Moral philosophy lecturer Dr Edward Spence, for instance, noted Monroe’s comment in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes that ‘when love goes wrong, nothing goes right’, claiming that ‘Plato would agree’.After Marilyn, Whishaw will join his 007 colleagues, as Q, in Bond 25, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga.   Now that\u0027s what I call a super-scary power coupleDirector Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W. Bush’s vice president, in the town of Casper, Wyoming.It’s 1963 and Cheney, then a very unpolished young man, is shown drunk as a skunk.McKay then cuts to a shot of Cheney sitting in the White House Situation Room, where he has taken control of operations after the 911 attacks in 2001. Bush was being flown to a place of safety — which suited Cheney just fine.          Director Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W. Bush’s vice president, in the town of Casper, Wyoming. Amy Adams stars as Lynne Cheney in Vice          \u0027In the film Cheney is seen in 1963 then a very unpolished young man\u0027.Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in Adam McKayMcKay’s masterstroke was to cast Christian Bale and Amy Adams as Cheney and his wife Lynne. They are sublime.‘I’ve never seen someone so purely interested in power,’ McKay said of Cheney. Equally, it’s rare that I’ve seen performances, such as the ones Bale and Adams deliver, that embody that sense of power on the screen.McKay said he and Bale spent a lot of time talking about characters who internalise their emotions. ‘They cover themselves up and Christian’s very good at giving life to such people,’ McKay said. Cheney may not have been a great orator but ‘he knew that the real power resides in the ones who are out of the spotlight’.McKay added that while preparing the film he thought of the 1986 movie Sid And Nancy, about Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Both were junkies.‘That was a love story,’ he commented, and this is a love story, too. ‘Lynne Cheney wanted safety, security — and she wanted control. And if Dick was going to be with her, he’s going to get those things.

He resigned shortly after U.S. officials raised the possibility that Trump would order the drawdown.The decision on Syria has bewildered U.S. allies and triggered harsh reaction from Trump\u0027s fellow Republicans in Congress.The Pentagon declined to comment on Afghanistan.

The Taliban insurgency has strengthened its grip over the past three years, with the government in Kabul controlling just 56 percent of Afghanistan, down from 72 percent in 2015, a U.S. government report showed.Trump privately has been grousing about U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, telling an ally as recently as Wednesday words to the effect of, \u0027What are we doing there? We\u0027ve been there all these years.\u0027The source, who asked to remain unidentified, said it appeared the president \u0027has lost all patience\u0027 with the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.More than 2,400 U.S. forces have died in the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan, and Pentagon officials have repeatedly warned that a precipitous exit would allow militants to develop new plots on America.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, often a vocal Trump ally, warned of possible danger to the United States if the drawdown goes through.\u0027The conditions in Afghanistan - at the present moment - make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy. If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 911,\u0027 Graham said in a statement.Trump last year approved an increase in U.S. troops but acknowledged that he did so reluctantly.Late last month, at least 22 Afghan police were killed in a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan\u0027s western province of Farah, adding to the growing casualty toll on Afghan security forces.Earlier this week, U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives held talks in Abu Dhabi on a deal that would end the war.

Don’t panic – our guide will help you get organised, giving you more time to relax and enjoy the festive season. Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets. And she suggests subscribing to the newsletters of the websites you’re thinking of using, to keep an eye on their offers. “Buy as soon as you see an offer you like. If you leave it until the last minute, you’re more likely to impulse buy, which may mean breaking your budget.”Check your delivery datesMcCall recommends going for nominated day delivery options whenever possible. This means you can pick a time and day convenient for you, which is particularly helpful during the busy festive season. “You can also arrange for gifts to arrive while your family are out, so it won’t spoil the surprise before Christmas morning.” Check the delivery options available before you buy: electricals specialist AO offers free delivery on all items, including its Christmas gift ideas and stocking fillers, and provides both click and collect and next-day delivery.Be preparedAvoid the stress of unexpected visitors by stockpiling extra gifts, says McCall. “It’s always lovely to see family and friends during the festive season, but it can be quite embarrassing if you receive a gift and have nothing to offer in return.” She recommends keeping a few festive gifts wrapped up with the tags blank, so you can fill them out at a moment’s notice. “Chances are they’ll never even realise it was a last-minute gift.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f38581e10db43d2264a7604a6a5b99732ff81df2/0_84_3208_1925/master/3208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45101e0a85e136bab02013a43c2d9952","title":"quiz are you a festive film fanatic","story":"So, you fancy yourself as a bit of an authority on Christmas cinema … but do you know your Elf from your Snowman?

Should we blame evolution or the advent of 24-hour shopping? The experts explain … With our busy lives, Christmas often seems to creep up on us – but the truth is we all know it’s coming. So why is it that just days before, we find ourselves stationed in an unlikely department store aisle, frozen to the spot in a state of panic over what we’re supposed to be buying? Despite the frequent jolly jingles and festive reminders that December is upon us, many of us still find ourselves among the unprepared each and every year. Why do we do it? We asked the experts to explain …Blame our ancestorsAt a basic level, it could all be down to evolutionary psychology, explains Prof Craig Jackson, head of psychology at Birmingham City University. “Evolutionary psychology looks at our behaviour thousands of years ago, and whether any of those primitive basic behaviours exist today,” he says. “Consumer and crowd psychology – the way we make decisions as shoppers and behave in crowds – is a behaviour that has evolved and helped keep us alive. You’ll see it come into play if there is a scarcity of resources – when stocks of a popular children’s toy or beauty product that everybody is clamouring for run low, for example.” In which case, reckons Jackson, an impulse is triggered in us to “get” that resource. “That’s when we behave irrationally – buying quickly, and often paying more for the security of having that item safely, without really thinking about why we’re doing it, or whether it’s a good idea.” It’s all beginning to make sense.What a gift really meansThere’s also the fact that a gift isn’t just a gift, is it? According to therapist Sally Baker, anxiety over how the gift will be viewed and judged means we find ourselves procrastinating over purchases further. “We’re frozen into inactivity because, in 2018, a gift needs to speak volumes. Current economic uncertainty increases financial stress and we’re also increasingly time-poor, which leaves us panicking over the perfect way to express our love and gratitude towards those around us,” she says. Is it any wonder we’re all leaving it until the last minute?Panic stationsEver thought about the shopping process? It only adds to our panic, explains Jackson. “Present buying at Christmas time means we’re heavily influenced by crowd behaviour, since everybody is shopping at once. That behaviour can be irrational, spontaneous and hard to predict,” he says. “You just have to watch an old-fashioned market trader to realise how effectively crowds can influence behaviour – with a couple of ‘plants’ in the crowd, ‘demand’ suddenly creates mass hysteria, leading to a huge surge in panic buying.” It’s not just IRL shopping either. “Online shopping creates a sense of urgency and panic too,” he says. “You’ll often see reminders of how many minutes you have left before your purchase leaves your basket, or pop-ups telling you how many people are looking at the same product, and how many are in stock.”Timing is crucialAnother reason we’re making bad decisions when it comes to those special gifts is down to when we’re actually making those purchases, says Jackson. “Internet shopping is open 247, which means we’re able to buy items at any point during the day – or night. This undoubtedly makes life more efficient, but it also means many of us are buying when our mind isn’t at its most logical – perhaps at 2am when we’re tired, lonely, upset or feeling irrational (or worse, when we’ve had a drink).”How to nail itSo what’s the answer? If you are planning ahead and are considering a laptop as a present, for example, and are unsure about which model to go for, one of the next-generation designs is a safe bet (see below). These laptops use Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, for increased performance and better battery life.Ultimately, according to Baker, nailing present buying is really about listening to those around us. “Make notes throughout the year – if somebody mentions they love a perfume you’re wearing, jot it down so you don’t forget. Gifts are about really listening to people and showing you’ve considered their feelings – whether it’s a colour they like, or a soundtrack or designer that brings them joy.” And keeping tabs on what your loved ones would appreciate throughout the year means less shopping drama when the festivities do finally arrive. Which means more time for mulled wine and mince pies ...If a next-generation laptop is on your Christmas shopping list, then look out for one of the latest models. They’re thinner, lighter and faster than previous versions, and the models listed below are all available from AO.Acer Swift 5 14” (£999)If you want a laptop that is really portable, the Acer Swift 5 could be the answer – a thin and ultra-lightweight model that is great for taking out and about.

Here’s how to nix itWhen it comes to enjoyable Christmas activities, gift shopping is up there with an 8am meeting the morning after your festive work bash. The problem is that – very much like turkey on its third day – some recipients are tough.Jeff Galak, associate professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, studies gift-giving behaviour, and finds most of us make two key mistakes. First, believing the amount we spend is directly proportionate to how much it will be liked. “Research shows recipients typically don’t care how expensive a gift was,” he says. Second, we go off-list. “Givers think the best gifts are unrequested, spontaneous and novel. In reality, most recipients want what they want.” So, if in doubt, ask. But if you’re met with “I don’t know” (as disappointing a comeback as “No, I don’t have the receipt”), follow this expert-sourced list to win over Christmas’s trickiest customers.Challenge 1: Your boss or clientThe tongue-in-cheek gift you think they’ll see the funny side of? Put it back – unless you like your nut roast with a side of P45. “Beware of getting something that makes the relationship too familiar,” warns Galak, who suggests going traditional and work-related: a nice pen, a monogrammed leather notebook, high-end stationery. “Everyone eats and drinks, so that’s a safe bet, too,” adds Katie Shapley, managing director of The Organisers, a bespoke personal assistant and shopping service.Challenge 2: The person who has everything“My rule is always quality over quantity,” explains Milda Chellingsworth, founder of personal shopping and stylist service Styling for You. An example? If their hobby is cooking, buy them a cookery course. If they have a favourite author, get a signed edition. If you can’t speak to them before they’ve had caffeine, invest in a state-of-the-art coffee machine (see below) – there are bean-to-cup options for every budget. “The worst thing is to buy a load of knick-knacks as they’ll end up dumped in the drawer. I hear time and time again from clients: ‘Oh, it’s so-and-so’s birthday coming up, so I’ll just re-gift that thing I never use.’”Challenge 3: Secret SantaThe £10 budget cap might be easy on the wallet, but for your brain it’s the gift equivalent of an eggnog hangover. “One of the big challenges in workplace gift exchanges is that they are often seen as a competition,” says Galak. Plus, you might not know that person particularly well. “It’s a situation where we feel self-conscious (since everyone knows what everyone gets).” At group present-opening parties, an easy hit is an activity that can be done together, such as photo-booth props or the Donald Trump “fake news” game, where you guess if certain quotes came from him.Challenge 4: The person you’ve bought for a million times before“When I ask male clients for information about their wife, I always hear: ‘She loves handbags,’” says Chellingsworth. “But how many handbags must she already own? Does she really want another one that she hasn’t picked herself? I ask them to tell me something more. And that’s when I hear: ‘Oh yeah, she did mention this new place that she wants to go to.’ That’s perfect. Make gifting an opportunity to spend time together.”Ask what they want. “If this feels taboo, ask a close friend of the recipient – this way you get the benefit of giving the right gift, as well as the benefit of it being a surprise,” advises Galak.Don’t pad a gift out. A US study (Presenter’s Paradox) found that adding a small stocking filler to an expensive gift actually reduced how much the recipient thought someone had spent.Make a list. “Because sales start so early now, you go into a shop, buy loads of stuff and then think: ‘Who can I give this to?’” explains Chellingsworth. “It’s less overwhelming to spend an hour thinking of a present for each person, and then shop.”If you fancy controlling your espresso from your smartphone or prefer to make bean-to-cup coffee, look no further than this selection of De’Longhi machines (check online for the latest prices).De’Longhi PrimadonaFor the coffee aficionado.

All in all, thoroughly enjoyable thus far.Also looking on the bright side of life is Thomas75164 who is reading Thomas Hardy’s Far From The Madding Crowd:I am enjoying the visit to Hardy country again. Such a wonderfully evocative writer with the constant threat of doom lurking.American Tabloid by James Ellroy has given Tom Mooney a good going over:No one but Ellroy could pull this off. This is a takedown of the Kennedys. Of Jack and Bobby, and Joe too. An expose of the lurid collusion between the mob, the CIA, the FBI, the teamsters and the government. It’s 10 books of plot rammed into 600 frantic, bloody, filthy pages.It’s genius. But now I’m worn out and tired. I feel like I got a shakedown from Pete Bondurant. Until next time, Mr Ellroy.Reading A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution from 1891-1924 by Orlando Figes has been an “effort” for greenmill, but “worth it”:I now feel that I have a reasonable purchase both on the events and the historical context in which they occurred. The book, although not a recent publication, also goes some way to explaining how Russia got to be the way it is in 2018. Highly recommended.The Soviet state has also been occupying rgilyead, who has just finished Serhii Plotsky’s Chernobyl:A serious historian’s view of what lead up to, and what followed from, the nuclear power station catastrophe. What is clear is that the instinctive secrecy of the Soviet state not only contributed to the causes of the disaster but also alienated the people of Ukraine and Belarus who were worst affected. This had a direct bearing on the rise of nationalistic political movements and the break up of the Soviet Union. The book may have a serious subject but the writing style is easy to read and rather compelling.“Another rather splendid work”, The Great American Novel by Philip Roth, has impressed julian6:An exuberant ode to baseball - a pastime with mythic status in the States. As a dabbler in softball - baseball’s gentler handmaiden - I do have quite a close rapport with this. With a joking nod to Moby Dick, Roth presents a gallery of absurd narratives about an impossibly strange and inept baseball team - the Ruppert Mundys. A wild satire and a wild ride, Roth’s liberating transgressive brio is a stunning tonic for our pinch-faced times.Finally, ChronicExpat has a good tip for reading beside the fire this Christmas:A couple of days ago I read Dickens’s The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton. This is actually an excerpt from The Pickwick Papers but is included as a free-standing short story (13 pages) in the Penguin Classics edition of A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings. It struck me that this might be a brilliant thing for reading aloud – lots of opportunities for funny and scary voices, etc. I have no children, nieces, nephews or grandchildren upon which to test this hypothesis but if you do, it might be one to keep in mind for Christmas ghost story reading.Please report back if you do test it!If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The Fed announced its fourth interest rate hike of the year on Wednesday and the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, indicated that while the pace of increases may slow, more were to come in 2019.The last recession was followed by years of ultra-low interest rates and massive bond-buying schemes from the world’s biggest central banks aimed at reviving the economy. Those policies have been credited with driving a rally in global stock markets.But as the Fed and others unwind those policies markets, while still close to record highs, have become increasingly volatile. Trade tensions between the US, China and other major trading partners have only served to fuel that volatility.At a press conference on Wednesday, Powell noted recent turbulence in the stock markets but said that when it came to the Fed’s decisions “no one market is the single dominant indicator”.“All people are talking about today is the aftermath of the Fed hike. The fact that Fed just killed the notion that they are here to backstop the market,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W Baird in Milwaukee.“People are just trying to fall back on technicals now that fundamentals seem a little chaotic. We’re still dealing with a stock market crash and it’s going to be with us for a while. This isn’t going to end in a quick fashion.”The latest fall in US markets comes as Donald Trump is threatening a government shutdown unless Congress agrees to fund his border wall with Mexico. Trump has appeared to back away from a shutdown but is now indicating he will not sign off on a stopgap budget unless there is funding for the wall.“At this moment, the president does not want to go further without border security, which includes steel slats or a wall,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said.

Shoppers are expected to buy 1.8m mince pies, four tonnes of sprouts and 400,000 bottles of fizz.The company said it would also have its biggest-ever day for online sales, with more than 220,000 orders to be delivered – or one every second between Thursday and Sunday.Wehrle said the decline reflected changing shopping habits. “There are a lot of other options now,” she said. “Kids want music streaming.

On race days, up to 4,000 people watched daring racing car drivers pilot the latest advancements in auto engineering, breaking land speed records – or crashing to their deaths trying.After nearly a century hosting sporting events including motorcycle races and Formula One, the Automobil-Verkehrs und Übungsstraße (Automobile Traffic and Practice Road, or Avus) held its last race in 1998, and the concrete grandstands were left to slowly disintegrate.But 20 years later, the cars still zoom by: the racetrack is now part of the 115 autobahn in west Berlin, and for passing motorists the grandstands are a roadside head-turning oddity, fenced off, crumbling and covered in graffiti.“It’s a unique building worldwide,” Djadda says over the roaring traffic, “because you’re so close. Look!” He jabs his arm at a huge truck passing in the near lane. It’s almost near enough to touch. “You cannot just tear it down.”Nearly three years ago, Djadda bought this roadside anomaly – which is now a listed historical building – and with Hamburg architect Christoph Janiesch has devised an ambitious plan to revive the grandstands. Djadda wants to turn the decrepit hall and announcer’s box into a glass-walled event venue and bar overlooking the autobahn. Offices are to be built into the voids beneath, lit by a dozen skylights in the stands. These will double as large vitrines lining the structure’s 240-metre length, and will display vintage automobiles where the crowds once sat, like a high-speed drive-by museum of the history of the car.The finished building will be a motoring spectacle, but the construction of the project itself will be a lesson in ingenuity. Work began earlier this year with the removal of the rotting wooden roof, which Djadda plans to replace in the spring. Due to the grandstands’ proximity to traffic, construction is only allowed during certain short windows and completion is targeted for the racetrack’s centenary in 2021.Christoph Rauhut, director of the Berlin state conservation authority, welcomes the project. “These are difficult buildings to protect,” he says. “What is planned is not so much a massive intervention but really a rediscovery of the original quality of the building.”“It has a high symbolic value,” agrees Richard Vahrenkamp, a logistics expert who has written extensively about German transportation.Although Vahrenkamp is hopeful Djadda’s project will preserve this piece of autobahn history, he remains sceptical about the business model: “There’s so much traffic, it’s not really a nice place for events.”Plenty of people expressed doubts during the two years it took to secure building permits, says Djadda. “People warned me, of course. And some said ‘you’re completely crazy’. I’m not the typical real estate developer.” Born in Iran and raised in Hamburg, Djadda ran a crystal glass business in Thailand for two decades before returning to Germany, where he is involved in businesses ranging from marzipan confections to tin signs. Although he describes the grandstands’ purchase price as “not so much”, Djadda expects the renovation to cost between €5m and €7m (£4.5m-£6.3m).He says the passing traffic is precisely the site’s appeal: the grandstands naturally draw a lot of attention: “I see this much more as a marketing place. Don’t forget, there are 93,000 cars every day driving by.”Conceived in 1913, the Avus was a privately funded effort to support the German automobile industry. Progress stalled by the first world war, but building resumed in 1919 and the first race was held in September 1921. On days without races, it was used as a toll road: wealthy Berliners paid 10 Deutsche Marks for a quick route to their lakeside homes along what is considered to be Europe’s first controlled-access motorway.Vahrenkamp says the road was also used as a testing ground for new materials such as macadam, asphalt and concrete. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, lessons learned on the Avus guided the development of the national freeway network. “It was the example for autobahn planning and design,” Vahrenkamp says. Later integrated into the autobahn system, the Avus went on to host both races and regular vehicle traffic through the 1990s.The racetrack’s observation tower is now a truckstop restaurant.“For some people it is an important, historic place,” says employee Manuela Mattner as she points out black-and-white racing photos plastered on the tabletops. “It’s the first thing you see when you drive into Berlin.”Djadda is betting on the value of that unique location.“Right now, due to the regulations, I cannot put any advertisements here,” he says. “It would distract from the driving. But once you have autonomous cars, then I can put anything I want. Then it’s a huge value. In that world, I would use it for advertisement.”Whether that world materialises any time soon is an open question, but Djadda is confident the project will succeed: “This will be even more monumental, I think, once we have only self-driving cars.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c98c6d495d25c15f9369b4a68b1d21b332701a/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9669a75f1c4a4ba2e07198b1277140ca","title":"national emergency brexit vote westminster","story":"As another vote looms amid the pantomime of Westminster, the core issues behind leave’s win have been ignoredLet me warn you right away that this column is trivial. Or rather, it’s about what is deemed trivial, which is a topic now under discussion at the highest levels of government. Even before gathering her cabinet ministers on Tuesday, Theresa May let it be known she would order them to focus on planning for Britain to leave Europe without a deal. Any business deemed “non-essential” would be junked.This raises a fundamental question. Who decides what matters? One prime minister’s “non-urgent” issue could be a matter of life or death for a homeless person. Amber Rudd’s priorities won’t match those of someone whose benefits have just been cut off.Yet there is a world beyond Brexit. True, it lacks the frenzied drama of cabinet walkouts, prime ministerial straw-clutching or humiliation served cold in Brussels. But things still happen – it’s just that they haven’t won much attention. It has been a good month to bury bad news. So allow me to disinter some of the headlines deep inside the newspapers.Since we’re counting small things, let’s start with children. Last week it was reported that a primary school in Great Yarmouth had opened its own food bank. It was launched by the headteacher, Debbie Whiting, after she saw pupils under 11 so hungry they were stealing from others’ lunchboxes. This week, more than half of teachers surveyed by the National Education Union expressed fears that some of their kids won’t have enough to eat this Christmas. They reported a boy turning up wearing his trousers back to front, in order to hide the holes in the knees, and a class where one in three children sleep in their uniforms because they have no pyjamas.If anything qualifies as a national emergency, it should be this. A new generation growing up without adequate food and clothing ought to be leading TV bulletins and shaming government ministers into action. What dominates instead is blue-on-blue match commentary, because Jacob Rees-Mogg is box office while poor people can be slipped in just before the “And finally”.It is not just that this high political crisis sucks up all the oxygen – it’s that broadcasters and newspapers use it as an excuse to spin the same old Westminster bubble story. “It’s like a mad computer game!” fizzed Andrew Marr last month. Except it’s not. It’s real, with big consequences, and it will drag on way past anyone’s bedtime.More news. Last weekend a Leeds-based charity supporting local sex workers said that many of the women they helped have been driven on to the streets because of problems with their universal credit, or to top up pensions. Charity worker Amber Wilson told the Huffington Post that she’d heard of women selling sex for cash to buy Christmas presents for their families.What saddens me is not those details so much as the sheer number of times I have heard their like while reporting this decade of austerity. From Preston to Portsmouth, those hollowed-out local economies and eviscerated public services formed the breeding ground for much of the vote to leave the EU. Whatever it meant for John Redwood or Daniel Hannan, for many voters I and other reporters met, the referendum was nothing to do with Irish backstops or custom unions or WTO rules. It wasn’t even necessarily about Europe. It was a whole beehive of frustrations, shoved through a crude binary: in or out, yes or no. And many people who had previously always voted for the red rosette looked at their lives, ignored for decades by the political and media classes, and thought: no.“We hear you!” promised Andy Burnham as leave swept region after region that summer night. After the vote, there was hair-pulling and chest-beating, concerned columns and politicians’ speeches. As May vowed: “A change is gonna come.” Except it didn’t. And two years later we’re back to ignoring the lived experience of whole swathes of the population.That carelessness runs through many of today’s arguments for holding a second referendum. When some well-lunched eminence chunters on about Brexit being an act of “monumental self-harm”, do they ever think how that sounds to someone who’s been harmed year after year by waiting months for an operation, by a care service that’s falling to bits, by the lack of police to follow up local muggings? The same goes for those homilies about how “no one voted to make themselves poorer”. Well, no one voted for their factories to shut and the council to bend over backwards to bring in some distribution warehouse with a bunch of minimum wage jobs, but that’s what they got.The results of that regional write-off barely ever make the headlines, yet they shape today’s news. Take another story you may have missed, from last month: statisticians now calculate that, throughout the Brexit campaign, even while the UK’s economy was powering ahead of the rest of the G7, as George Osborne boasted, the north-east was actually in recession. Sure enough, from Stockton-on-Tees to South Tyneside they voted to leave, and by stonking majorities. How has the government tried to close the gap? It hasn’t. Research published this month showed that total public spending across the north has plunged more than £6bn since 2010, even while the south-east and the south-west have seen a rise of £3bn.Let us connect these stories back to the Brexit catastrophe. With Westminster locked in stalemate, Britain now stands on the brink of a second referendum. If it takes that step, I can make two sure bets. First, the prospect of a stolen vote will cause uproar. Second, in any rerun, Labour will play a central role. As John McDonnell confirmed to me last month, Labour will fight for remain – and he and Jeremy Corbyn will be scrutinised on a daily basis for their commitment and enthusiasm. With fat chance of converting those -reading retirees along the English Riviera from Brexit, the battle will be won or lost in those Labour heartlands that went leave, such as south Wales and the north-east.There can’t be any offer to voters of vote again, plebs, and this time get it right. Tony Blair and those other beached whales of British politics can’t be let near the campaign: these people need only open their mouths to lose whichever argument they want to make. Instead, remain politicians will have to say: we know you voted for change, and we promise you’ll get it. Big-money policies will be needed to counter the sense that to be born poor in one of the richest societies in human history is to be jailed in disadvantage, that the state under austerity has become an instrument of punishment, and that public money is often handed to those who least need or deserve it.If parliamentary maths makes a general election unlikely, then a second referendum in which remain stands even a chance must still make a Labour offer to Labour voters. To address the resentment that fed much of the 2016 vote, remain would have to admit that many people across Britain have been overlooked for far too long and promise major investment, coupled with a shift in power away from Westminster and the market, and towards local democracy.The political class’s abject failure has opened the door to all manner of mad ideas. By all means, count this as another. But if we do end up with a referendum, I can’t see any way for remain to secure a convincing victory, apart from to present itself as not the incumbent but the insurgent, not the status quo but the radicals. And how will the Tories squatting in Downing Street ever do that, apart from agreeing with their foe Jeremy Corbyn a means of getting his policies on to the statute books?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d333868df3256845f50b6fd7139bb3202537d4ca/0_209_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf2b2c5d7923c18358eddf2d0ac327e2","title":"polls stay eu yougov brexit peoples vote","story":"With deadlock in Westminster over how to move forward with Brexit, what are the polls saying about people’s changing attitudes towards leaving the EU?

Like many of my European colleagues, I came to the UK for the reputation of its higher education system, and I want to stay. Today I completed my application to the EU settlement scheme pilot, which is open to university and NHS employees. I should be feeling relieved, or even joyful. But I don’t feel like celebrating.The Home Office’s official confirmation letter stated how “pleased” they were to inform me that I had been “granted Limited Leave to Remain (LTR) in the United Kingdom for five years”. But rather than having gained anything, I feel that something has been taken away in the most clandestine and cynical of ways. Something vital, something irreplaceable.A child of the 1980s, I grew up in former West Germany. The first decade of my life is awash with memories of being stopped at border crossings to declare the purpose and, more importantly, duration of our stay – the emphasis being less on our date of arrival and more on our departure.During my teenage years, these borders gradually disappeared, and by the time I went to university I considered myself a true citizen of Europe. Europe had become more than just a number of countries on a map, more than an abstract idea: it had become our home. If at any point someone had offered to trade my German passport for one that only said Europe, I would have snatched it out of their hands before the ink was dry.The freedom to travel, work and live anywhere in Europe forms a crucial part of our identity as academics. Our work depends on an open international environment in which we move and exchange ideas freely. It makes us who we are, professionally and personally. My “success” in the pilot scheme took this freedom and identity from me, and seeing it written in black and white leaves me with a profound sense of sadness and regret. Did I betray my convictions by taking the opportunity as a higher education professional to sign up to the pilot scheme?To add insult to injury, the supposedly straightforward, user-friendly process turns out to be a minotaur’s maze: a cold-hearted “computer-says-no” routine that would make the most hard-nosed bureaucrat blush. Anyone volunteering to put themselves through this ordeal could be forgiven for thinking that the ghost of Kafka must be haunting the corridors of the Home Office headquarters.For starters, there is the EU Exit: ID Document Check app, available for Android devices (version 6.0 or higher) with near field communication technology, but not Apple’s iOS. For many, myself included, the app repeatedly fails to scan their passport on at least one of four mandatory stages, and after four failed attempts one is blocked from trying again for seven days. Another week in limbo.I called the telephone helpline, and although I spoke to at least five different people (including one senior manager), none of them had been briefed in how to use the actual app. My surprise at this revelation was matched only by the telephone operatives’ own embarrassment.Introducing such a woefully underprepared and dysfunctional pilot scheme fundamentally undermines Theresa May’s rhetoric in referring to EU citizens as “friends, neighbours and colleagues”. “We want you to stay,” she told us back in September. But actions speak louder than words.Those of us who managed to complete our application against the odds are reluctant to credit our success to the “straightforward, streamlined system” the government promised us. Despite claims to the contrary, the system appears designed precisely to put people off, not welcome them in.Is it worth it? Are we paying too high a price (and I don’t mean the £65 application fee)? After months of waiting to hear what fate awaited EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, we’re left with a pyrrhic victory: a paltry Leave to Remain status entirely unfit for the modern international academic whose vocation is to push boundaries, not be restricted by them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab8ef4af1d5c0c10f94ea09c375ec86a6608e02c/0_365_3741_2245/master/3741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae8c021eaaf90ebbda4c573323a476d","title":"best films 2018 uk us roma","story":"Topping both our US and UK critics’ polls, this is a great piece of storytelling with inspired and surreal setpieces and electrifying sequences in the teeming streets of Mexico CityIs this the film that Alfonso Cuarón has been yearning to make all his career, or all his life? It certainly looks like the apparently difficult, non-commercial, personal work that only someone with a vast accumulation of prestige could get made. Every richly considered detail looks as if he spent a great deal of time honing it. Roma, based on his own childhood and set in a well-to-do household in early 70s Mexico City, is Cuarón’s return to his roots after high-profile English-language movies such as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the dystopian nightmare Children of Men and most recently his glorious outer space adventure Gravity. In fact, Cuarón gives a hint in Roma of what might have inspired this previous film when some characters go to a cinema in Mexico City to see the 1969 sci-fi adventure Marooned, with astronauts floating off into deep space.It is a great piece of storytelling, sympathetic and intelligent, with inspired and surreal setpieces and electrifying sequences in the teeming streets of Mexico City, in which I think the beautiful black-and-white cinematography has facilitated digital work visually, modifying and fabricating the period details. It is a very involving story, in which there are these extraordinary moments of excitement. And then, just when you think you have got the measure of its tone, Roma blindsides you with something desperately sad, and an aftermath that gives a catharsis for this sadness.Non-professional newcomer Yalitza Aparicio plays Cleo, the live-in maid who is of Mixteco heritage and occasionally speaks her own language and not Spanish – about which one of the children complains: “Stop talking like that.” Her private life begins to unravel in tandem with that of her employer, Sofía (Marina De Tavira) whose husband has abandoned her and the kids – and she is in denial, a process with which Cleo is effectively expected to help, along with all other domestic duties. For her part, Cleo has to inform her boyfriend, a dodgy martial-arts enthusiast, that she has missed her period.Cleo is much loved within the family. Even when Sofía loses her temper with her, or treats her harshly, it is obviously just a symptom of her own marital breakdown and she will apologise immediately, and emotionally. The truth is that in being such a rock, Cleo is being the responsible figure that the children’s father is not. Both Cleo and Sofía know what it is like to have men who let them down. The difference is that Cleo has an extra load to bear: a secret pregnancy, as well being a quasi-parent to these children. This is the powerful narrative which licenses byways into wonderful incidental moments, such as the family’s Christmas trip to some relatives who are into guns, and treat everyone to an uproarious shooting party out in the country – and then a New Year’s Eve trip to some other in-laws, including a Scandinavian family called the Larssons, where there is a bizarre, almost dreamlike forest fire. Only a storyteller of enormous confidence could handle what might otherwise feel like pointless digressions. But they are dazzling visually, and every moment reveals something in both Sofía and Cleo.The distinctions of race and class are everywhere in Roma, not in fact in the dramatically overt snobbery and racism that Cleo might face in another sort of film, but rather in a thousand tiny assumptions about her servitude, which are there even in her employers’ quite genuine kindliness and concern. The point is that her own innate dignity and moral generosity make her equal to anyone with whom she is in contact. This is her heroism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45b6f33665b6823d8fd48675a467a754eb933fa8/0_252_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1937dfc1c2d0c2fa78b2abd8f9e7ae5d","title":"danny dyer to present channel 4s alternative christmas message","story":"EastEnders actor will share his thoughts on future of UK and reflect on friendship with Harold PinterDanny Dyer will present Channel 4’s Alternative Christmas Message this year and will use the appearance to share his wisdom on relationships, his considered views on the future of the UK, and to reflect on his friendship with the late playwright Harold Pinter.His speech – scheduled to air against the Queen’s message at 3pm on Christmas Day – will cap off a year in which the Brexit-voting actor was repeatedly in the headlines after calling former prime minister David Cameron a “twat” on national television and celebrating his daughter Dani Dyer winning Celebrity Love Island.Channel 4 has produced an alternative message for the last 25 years, inviting a celebrity or newsworthy figure to reflect on the past year.The EastEnders actor will use his message to complain about Donald Trump being an “an absolute melt” and criticise the state of the British government. “That shambles down in Westminster, what a palava that is. I mean where are our leaders? Where are they? There’s been more backstabbing than we have in Albert Square.”He will also urge members of the public to find someone to look up to in their private lives: “That’s what I think we need more of, heroes, role models.

Xherdan Shaqiri – all five foot, six inches of said “Big Shaq” – had made his presence felt at Anfield before the starring cameo against Manchester United that prompted Van Dijk’s proclamation. Even so he is genuinely taken aback by the reaction to the special day that did for a former special one.“It has had a big impact,” Shaqiri says of his matchwinning contribution for Liverpool against the old adversary. “I can see it from the people working here.” He is referring to Melwood, a hive of activity as Jürgen Klopp’s players prepare for Friday’s visit to Wolverhampton Wanderers, pose for photoshoots and film Christmas greetings. Georginio Wijnaldum is sporting a Santa hat while recording a festive message for supporters. Jordan Henderson high-fives two young fans on a visit to the training ground. Shaqiri looks sheepish at the acclaim reserved for him since Sunday. He adds: “We had the Christmas party that night and it seemed everybody was coming over to me to say thank you. I was quite surprised. Everybody was saying ‘Thank you, thank you, you’re a legend already!’ That was nice to hear, and it was a nice feeling that day, but I’m a guy who closes each day and looks forward. In the end it was a Premier League game with three points and now I am looking forward to the next one on Friday.”Shaqiri echoes Klopp’s instruction about one game at a time, as all his players do, a mantra that has served Liverpool particularly well during a gruelling run to the Premier League summit. In truth, however, it has been impossible for the Switzerland international to move on from scoring twice against United given the closure it signalled for José Mourinho at Old Trafford. United’s conqueror and the man with the final nails for Mourinho to boot, Shaqiri will never be allowed to forget his place in Anfield’s affections even if he wanted to.“I had a lot of messages from my friends when it happened,” he says of Mourinho’s sacking. “There were a lot of good messages about the United game at first and then, when the news came out about Mourinho, I had messages saying: ‘That’s your fault!’ But this is football sometimes. I don’t think it was just because we won that game that United wanted to change their manager. There were other reasons but it means the game goes down in history. It will always be in my history too.“I’m very glad I helped the team win. That is the most important thing and I was delighted to have an impact on such an important game. I knew before that there was a big rivalry between Liverpool and Man United but to score two goals was very beautiful. I will never forget this game. It was a special day not only for me but for the club, too, and to be back on top of the table is always a nice look.”Shaqiri is the first Liverpool substitute to score twice against United and Sunday’s brace took him to five goals for the season, more than he scored in his first two full seasons at Stoke City. The 27-year-old cannot avoid questions about adapting to a squad role at Anfield after being accustomed to regular football with Stoke. He does not avoid giving answers about the difficulty of the transition. He is also sincere in his belief that playing for Klopp and Liverpool, a manager who brings out the best in him and a club that satisfies his craving for Champions League football again, provides ample compensation.“This team and this coach have given me everything,” explains Shaqiri, whose 17 appearances for Liverpool so far include nine starts. “You can see on the pitch that I feel very happy here and am playing maybe my best football. I’m a player who always wants to improve and this has been the perfect move for me. I’m delighted with how it’s going.“Every player wants to play, that’s pretty normal. Every player is unhappy when he’s on the bench, that’s pretty normal too. But it’s football, only 11 players can start, and the coach has his gameplan for each game. It’s OK how it’s going at the moment. I wanted to play Champions League again. I had played in it before and I missed the Champions League a lot, so I wanted that again and the chance to play there again with Liverpool was perfect.”It was perfect also for Shaqiri’s parents, Fatime and Isen, who share both his love for English football and pride in returning to the level he enjoyed with Bayern Munich and, to a lesser extent, Internazionale.The forward says: “My parents watched the United game on TV in Switzerland and said they were going crazy when I scored. They are very proud of me that I’m playing for a top club, a great club, again. My parents wanted me to stay in England because they love the football here and how the people feel about football. It was important for them too that I stayed in the Premier League. I’m very proud with how my story has gone. I’ve played for some very big teams and it is not normal how I got there. It is a dream for every player to have this kind of career, so I am very proud of this.”Isen and Fatime left Kosovo with their three sons – who all eventually played for Basel’s youth teams – when Shaqiri was four years old, before the war started. His father washed dishes in a restaurant when the family first arrived in Switzerland before finding work in construction. His mother was a cleaner, Xherdan her assistant. His family background accompanies Liverpool’s man of the moment each time he sets foot on the pitch.“You can see my history on my football boots with my flags,” he explains. “A lot of people have misunderstood this. I was born in Kosovo and grew up in Switzerland. Some people think I’m not giving everything for Switzerland because I have the flag of Kosovo on one foot but that is totally wrong. It is a big part of my history, my life history, and will always be with me. The Swiss flag is on my left foot because I score with that but I scored one with my left and one with my right against Man United so it was one for both! I had big flags on the back of my boots for the World Cup. The flags I have now are smaller but they are there.”The Football Association of Serbia complained to Fifa about the Kosovo flag on Shaqiri’s boot after he scored a last-minute winner against their team at this summer’s World Cup. He was fined 10,000 Swiss francs for a double-headed eagle celebration – similar to the one on the Albanian flag – and omitted from Liverpool’s Champions League visit to Red Star Belgrade last month by Klopp to avoid inflaming tensions further.“I understood his decision,” Shaqiri admits. “He wanted more concentration on the game, that was the only reason, and it was the right choice because there was a lot of attention only on me even in the game in Liverpool. It was the right decision not to bring more attention to a Champions League game.”The reception promises to be different when Liverpool resume their Champions League campaign next year at Bayern, where Shaqiri won two Bundesliga titles, the Champions League, two German Cups, the German Supercup, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup in two and a half years. Often the wins were at the expense of Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund. “We were not only a very good team but we were like a big family,” he reflects. “Every player played very well and I think we were the best team that Bayern Munich ever had in their history.”Shaqiri was part of a title-winning team for five consecutive seasons between 2010 and 2014 including a hat-trick of Swiss Super League triumphs with Basel. “I hoped it would always be like that,” he says. It is a feeling he is determined to relive with Liverpool.He adds: “I know how it is to lift trophies. It is amazing to have these celebrations with the fans and it is my dream to have the same again with this club. This is our goal. We have shown so far that we can hold our nerve. We are on a very good way. We are strong offensively and defensively so there is a very good balance in the team. That is very important for winning titles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66c737837735de2f8d395e13149d4be90d77e01b/15_42_2532_1519/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca58064d6651291b7f65857a63ac874d","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Manchester United start life without José Mourinho, Burnley need to rediscover their grit and Southampton look to buildWhen Cardiff sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjær in September 2014 it seemed a stretch to imagine, little over four years later, he would be bringing Manchester United to a venue where – put lightly – things did not go especially well. In fairness to Solskjær it always seemed a case of wrong club, wrong time more than anything else but there are a few parallels with the situation he has walked into this week. At the time of Solskjær’s arrival, Malky Mackay’s conservative style had run its course and the Bluebirds needed fresh, forward thinking. That is certainly what United require and, in contrast to his time in South Wales, Solskjær inherits a squad capable of fitting the brief. It is time to put smiles on faces and, while Cardiff are these days more formidable than the team Solskjær struggled to remould, this looks the perfect opportunity for him to make a start. NAEverton have been lauded for their bolder approach under Marco Silva and, had Richarlison not missed a fine early chance, could have given Manchester City a headache at the Etihad last Saturday. Instead they fell short and are yet to record the kind of statement result that would really turbo-charge Silva’s revolution. In fairness, all of their meetings with top-six opponents so far have been away from home, so it will be instructive to see how, at Goodison Park, they can trouble a Tottenham side that may still be aching from its midweek exertions. Their last victory against a team in that bracket came when they hammered City 4-0 in January 2017 and Spurs, who may have to become used to hassle now Mauricio Pochettino appears to be Manchester United’s objet d’amour, would be the ideal scalp to spark hopes that they are going places. NAIt’s not exactly new to question a manager picking a shadow team for a Cup game, with the all-powerful Premier League in mind. But the narrowness of Leicester’s Carabao Cup defeat to Manchester City simply emphasises such complaints. Claude Puel always knew that Pep Guardiola would make changes, so why not make this the most important game of the next few weeks? Leicester are 12th in the Premier League and it will be surprising if they finish much higher or lower than that. But even if they did finish higher, would it matter? In 2016-17, Puel took Southampton to the League Cup final and finished eighth: you can guarantee the Saints fans remembered the former more than the latter, while the manager was sacked that summer. To justify Puel’s approach now, Leicester need to collect some points this Christmas, starting against Chelsea on Saturday. NMConor Coady is, by his own admission, Liverpool through and through. The Wolves defender joined his boyhood club at the age of 12 and harboured hopes of making the grade there. It did not quite happen but on Friday he will face them in a league game for the first time, and it is worth reflecting on how fine a player he has become. Now 25, Coady sits at the heart of Nuno Espírito Santo’s back three and is fundamental, his radar-like switches to their marauding wing-backs a defining feature of their play. He captains them, too, and it is no exaggeration to say the 25-year-old, who had never played in his current position until Nuno’s arrival, is becoming one of the league’s better players in that role. This would be a fine time to underline the point: Wolves have one eye on the top six after three straight wins. Five years ago, Coady could hardly have imagined wanting to derail a Liverpool title bid but he and his teammates have their own ambitions now. NALast season’s fixture saw Burnley reduced to – in the nicest way possible – an irrelevance, with the Emirates bidding farewell to Arsène Wenger and the home side rattling in five goals. The problem for Sean Dyche is they have continued in similarly generous vein this season, but there was a glimmer of promise in their performance at Wembley last weekend. Dyche plumped for a back three and duly saw Tottenham bluster before Christian Eriksen’s late heartbreaker that setup was “not a gimmick”, according to Dyche, and he may well opt for a similar approach on Saturday. It is likely Burnley’s subsequent four games – at home to Everton, West Ham and Fulham, and away to Huddersfield – are of more consequence to their relegation struggle so any points here would be a welcome bonus. How Arsenal respond to the end of an unbeaten run that had not always been convincing will provide the latest insight into Unai Emery’s revolution Dyche may fancy he can cause them more frustration. NAPep Guardiola kept plenty in reserve – namely Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero – for most of the win over Everton and some of the greatest encouragement that afternoon came from a player who has endured time on the sidelines himself. In September, Leroy Sané was completely left out of the squad that faced Newcastle after an unhappy summer watching Germany’s World Cup struggles from afar. He is now in electric form: his last eight appearances have brought five goals and six assists, two of the latter laid on a plate for Gabriel Jesus against Everton, and he is playing some of his finest football since joining City in 2016. Palace should offer up chances to continue that run. NAIt is best not whispered too loudly but the London Stadium is in danger of becoming a happy place. West Ham have won four in a row – the first time they have managed that in the league since February 2014. The goals have started to flow freely with players like Robert Snodgrass and Javier Hernández revitalised under Manuel Pellegrini. They are becoming a team in their manager’s image and the supporters sang Pellegrini’s name at Fulham last weekend. It is light years away from September, when four early defeats suggested his time in east London would be limited, and the Christmas period looks set up for them to push on. Watford, Southampton, Burnley and Brighton will hold few fears between now and 2 January so it is not a huge stretch to imagine them sitting sixth at the turn of the year. Saturday’s visit of Watfordcould be a far cry from two seasons ago, when the Hornets’ 4-2 win sparked crowd trouble around their hosts’ new abode. For now, Pellegrini has inspired a sense of happy families. NAPerhaps the most encouraging thing for Southampton from beating Arsenal was not just the result, but the dynamism of their team – and manager. Whereas Mark Hughes was largely inert, in more ways than one, Hasenhüttl showed he can be decisive, particularly in the substitutions he made: on came Shane Long and Charlie Austin just after the hour, and 20 minutes later Long crossed to Austin for the winner. A double switch working as neatly as that is, to a point, down to some luck, but it showed intent. Long came on for Nathan Redmond, at a time when many managers might have just dug in for the draw. Hasenhüttl’s methods are already taking hold, and he looks likely to get more out of Southampton’s moderate squad than his predecessor. NMBournemouth’s terrific start to the season was built on making short work of their peers. Against the ‘big six’ teams they’re yet to win a point, losing all five games, but against the rest, their record reads P12 W7 D2 L3. With the Premier League so starkly split into three separate sub-isions, this will be repeated a lot elsewhere, but it might be of concern to Eddie Howe that this consistency is slipping. In the last month or so they’ve lost to Newcastle and Wolves: forgivable, but not something to make a habit of if they want to make an impression on the ision. They’ve got Brighton this weekend: maybe it’s dramatic to call it a must-win, but their two fixtures after that are against Manchester United and Spurs. NM“I must tinker clever,” Claudio Ranieri, a man ostentatiously aware of his old reputation, noted in one of his early press conferences at Fulham, but there’s not been much evidence of that so far. The experiment of playing Calum Chambers in midfield has been a qualified success, but the logic of other choices in last week’s defeat to West Ham wasn’t quite as solid. He picked Dennis Odoi at right-back when Cyrus Christie was on the bench, or played Tom Cairney on the right and Aboubakar Kamara as a No 10. Tinkering, sure, but clever? It’s not working so far. Of course a new manager needs time to figure things out, but with Fulham bottom and with one win from his five games so far, he doesn’t have much of it.

The values are likely to be a “conservative estimate”, CAAT said, due to an opaque system of “open” licences that allow an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period.The DIT confirmed open licences are included among export licence figures, but has denied they are subject to less scrutiny.The data shows a record number of arms export licences to nations on the watchlist in 2017, almost double the previous year. While 2018 was not included in the study, the British deal to supply 48 Eurofighter Typhoons to Saudi Arabia, reported earlier this year, is worth £5bn alone, a value that dwarfs previous agreements.In 2017, there were 855 military licence approvals for Saudi, worth £1.3bn, compared with 331, worth £680m, the previous year.In total, 5,782 export licences for military items in countries of concern were approved last year, worth £1.5bn, up from 2,477, worth £820m, in 2016.Some campaigners expressed concern over the doubling of licence approvals to countries with human rights abuses since the Brexit referendum in 2016.In July, MPs from the committee on arms export control called on the government to adopt a default position of blocking arms sales to countries accused of abuses.Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Colombia, all countries on the FCO watchlist, were among the DTI’s “core markets” for defence and security opportunities for 2017-18.Britain is Saudi Arabia’s second largest arms dealer after the US, providing military exports worth £10.3bn over the past decade despite continued condemnation of the kingdom’s use of British weaponry in its bombing of Yemen. UN agencies allege that the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has violated international humanitarian standards, including widespread and systematic attacks on civilian targets.International pressure to halt arms to Riyadh has intensified following the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Last month, Denmark and Finland joined Germany in halting future arms sales to the kingdom, although their arms exports are relatively small.British arms exports were also approved to many countries with weapon sales restrictions imposed by the UN, the EU or both. These include China, Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Russia. The DIT said it respects both EU and UN arms embargoes, but that it may send items not defined as weaponry to peacekeepers in such countries.Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a member of the Commons committee on arms exports control and the Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, said: “Approving sales of powerful surveillance equipment to regimes that hunt and kill journalists, or planes and bombs to dictators who use them on schools and hospitals, is a clear-cut violation of UK arms export control law. The government contempt for the law has inevitably resulted in UK arms exports enabling human rights abuses worldwide.”Iain Overton, of Action on Armed Violence, said: “There needs to be more attention focused on analysis of human rights reports before we sell arms to these countries. Even if there was now to be an arms embargo for Saudi Arabia, we have funded Saudi arsenals. There is no notion of pre-planning or forewarning.”Andrew Smith, of CAAT, called on the prime minister to put human rights ahead of arms sales. There is “little control of how these weapons will be used or who they will be used against. Right now, UK arms are playing a central role in the Saudi-led destruction of Yemen. The arms sales that are being promoted today could be used to fuel atrocities for years to come.“The policy of arming dictatorships and pouring weapons into warzones has been pursued by governments of all political colours. It is time for Theresa May and her colleagues to end the hypocrisy and finally put human rights ahead of arms sales.”A DIT spokesman said:“The UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world. Risks around human rights abuses are a key part of our export licensing assessment, which also takes into account our obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty and other relevant rules of international law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Never fear – here is our guide to the best new board gamesThis family-friendly game of rival archaeologists sees players racing to explore an ancient Egyptian tomb, uncovering priceless artefacts as they make their way along a twisting underground passage. At first glance it resembles roll-and-move games such as Monopoly or Ludo. But where those traditional family favourites rely heavily on luck, Luxor is more tactical. It uses clever card play to determine how you progress along its subterranean track, emphasising smart decisions rather than chance.As you delve deeper into the tomb you will discover an assortment of treasures that boost your score and gain new, more powerful cards that let you carve out advantages over your opponents. It is an addictive blend of fast and thoughtful gameplay and, while its grave-robbing theme may not be culturally sensitive, it is quick, elegant and accessible – an ideal option for anyone dipping their toes into modern board games for the first time.For many families, a post-turkey game of charades is a Christmas staple, and the festive season would not feel quite complete without watching uncle Fred turning purple with rage while trying to mime “The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe”. This team-based game of clever communication aims to create the same kind of feel, but rather than making you wildly gesticulate, it challenges you to convey messages to your teammates using a vocabulary of just 105 words printed on cards.This turns out to be trickier than you might think. You could end up expressing “Super Mario” as: “Play with red blue jump man,” or “hedgehog” as: “Small brown not fast animal.” With such a small pool of words at your disposal, you will have to be creative to get your meaning across, and if it is difficult for the player coming up with the message, it is just as tough for the other members of their team trying to decipher it.With both sides simultaneously attempting to guess the same word, there is real competitive tension. And if you are playing with kids, the game comes with a selection of difficulty levels, letting you tailor its setup to players of all ages.This deceptively simple game casts players as the leaders of Polynesian tribes vying to explore and settle a cluster of tropical islands. On each turn you will place one of your tribespeople on the board, claiming areas of land and water. The aim is to spread your people as widely as you can across the map, but also to control the islands by having more members of your tribe on them than your opponents. Along the way, you will also boost your score by picking up resources such as bamboo and coconuts.With multiple ways to earn points, you will face some tricky decisions as you try to work out the best ways to place your people. And even once you have come up with a plan, you will need to seize vital sections of the board before your rivals. The result is that, in spite of its sunny artwork and idyllic island theme, Blue Lagoon reveals a brutal competitive streak as you cut your opponents off from the territories they most need.It is enough to spark some intense grudges, and it is impressive just how much antagonism and strategy the game squeezes out of some very straightforward rules.Troll \u0026amp Dragon, a child-friendly game of courageous treasure hunters, sees players sneaking through caverns guarded by ferocious monsters, helping themselves to as much loot as they can carry in the process. Each turn starts by rolling and re-rolling dice in an effort to accumulate diamonds. But each time you do it, you risk attracting the attention of an angry troll, dropping your treasure as you flee.From there you will move on to a dragon’s cave, where things become more heated. Once again you will roll dice, this time aiming to grab precious golden nuggets. But as you do, your opponents will also roll a set of red dragon dice, attempting to wake the slumbering beast and chase you off empty-handed.The result is a fast-paced and frantic scramble. To escape with your ill-gotten goodies you will have to judge when to push your luck and when to turn and run. It takes some quick-thinking analysis of risks and rewards, and watching young players trying to find that balance can be hilarious, making for riotous fun for grown ups as well as kids.The first thing that strikes you about this game of strange contraptions and eccentric engineers is the giant cardboard structure it deposits in the middle of your table. It is a container full of coloured marbles with a chute-like mechanism that lets them slide out as you play, and it looks a bit like something Wile E Coyote might order from the Acme Corporation.Look beyond this physical gimmick, though, and you will find a slick and streamlined game about inventors trying to claim the top prize in a prestigious science fair. You will battle to build machines that impress the judges, harvesting different types of energy – represented by those shiny marbles – and spending it to add new components to your growing creation. You will unlock new abilities, generate extra power and make ever-more dramatic plays as you fight to establish your scientific supremacy.There is a powerful sense of progression as you incrementally augment your machine, and it is deeply satisfying seeing its parts starting to work together. But with players taking just a single action on each of their turns, it never gets bogged down in complexity, and as soon as one game is over, you will be itching to start another.Keyforge: Call of the Archons2 players, 30-45 minutes, from £8.99In 1993, the designer Richard Garfield released Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game that cast players as powerful mages doing battle in a fantasy universe. It became a smash hit, with players building collections of cards and using them to create custom decks, all fine-tuned for different strategies. But it also led to the growth of a secondary market, with powerful cards sometimes changing hands for hundreds of pounds online.Garfield’s latest game aims to side-step this collector mania. Like Magic, Keyforge sees players command armies of beasts and warriors in card-based conflict. But rather than building your own deck, you will buy a pre-constructed one assembled by a computer algorithm.It is a novel approach, and it makes Keyforge much cheaper to get into than other card battlers. But it is also a fascinating game in its own right, with plenty of interesting tactical decisions and clever card combinations to discover. The game goes out of its way to ensure you have something interesting to do on almost every turn, and contests swing back and forth as players deploy their troops, clash in combat and exploit an array of special powers and abilities. It makes for some dramatic and unpredictable moments as the fight for supremacy plays out on your kitchen table.Miniature battle games have a reputation for complexity. But Wildlands, a fantasy skirmish game that sees players command squads of warriors in fast and furious combat, aims to make things quicker, simpler and infinitely more approachable.It hands players command of an assortment of sword fighters, archers and magically-powered automatons, throwing them into a frantic struggle for survival. The aim is to outsmart and overpower your opponents, gaining points for killing off enemy troops and collecting magic crystals scattered around the board.In the process, you will come up with clever plans and react to your rivals’ plays, picking off your foes with well-placed crossbow bolts or charging headlong into hand-to-hand combat. The result is a game full of twists, turns and dramatic moments, where lone soldiers put up heroic last stands against multiple assailants, fleet-footed rogues e out of the path of volleys of arrows, and grizzled sorcerers lob fireballs at one another across darkened corridors.What is most impressive is that Wildlands conjures so much action and drama with so little mechanical clunkiness. Everything in the game revolves around simple sets of symbols on cards, and it combines real tactical depth with pick-up-and-play simplicity. It also comes with four different factions to command, and a double-sided board giving you either a ruined city or a subterranean dungeon to battle over, ensuring your clashes have plenty of variety.Have you played any great games this year?

Now they had to be totally woke, and fluent in identity politics and intersectionality. (See: everything from Little Mix’s new album, featuring a song called Joan of Arc, to people digging through Dua Lipa and Stormzy’s archives to shame them for old tweets.) Inclusive, socially aware pop should be celebrated, but at its worst it can be a shallow branding exercise that makes the music feel like hard work.While she is hyper-versed in matters of gender, sexuality and class, Christine and the Queens (nee Héloïse Letissier) has never made these topics heavy-going. Funny, charismatic and an obscenely great dancer to boot, she has been a tonic since she emerged on the UK music scene in 2016. Still, discussions of her identity as a pansexual, politicised woman sometimes threatened to overshadow the music. And there was a big identity shift to get your head around on her second album, Chris – the name she now goes by. The album is a compelling portrait of a woman in flux. She cut off her hair and – having declared “I’m a man now” on her debut album – leaned into a muscular femininity. Since releasing her 2014 debut, she has embraced her power and sexuality, enough to question whether the two are interchangeable – or even incompatible.Most of the songs on Chris detail her own pleasure and how the trials of loving feel: swaggering back from a tryst salty with sweat, like a man would the way her jaw pimples when she feels shame begging her male and female crushes to succumb to her skin, soft with desire but thickened by pride. She slips between dominant and disempowered archetypes, eroding what listeners might think of as traditionally masculine or feminine. All of which would be academic, even alienating, if her intricate synthpop didn’t convey these qualities – lustful intent, slippery power imbalance, the overwhelming churn of self-loathing beneath your skin. Sometimes the music does it more directly than the words. While there are beautiful lyrics on the album (“To love him is to scare a mist  to make a fauna flee”), her twisty intonation can render them opaque without the lyrics sheet.Such a close relationship between sound and intent is testament to Chris stepping up as producer. She co-produced her debut and has since claimed that her label encouraged her not to make a big deal of the fact – which, if true, indicts the gulf between the marketability of empowered female pop stars and the industry restrictions they still face. After unsuccessful sessions with Mark Ronson and Damon Albarn as producers, she fought to make her second album herself, working with session musicians from several classic 1980s pop albums.The music is full of familiar sounds – lead single Girlfriend pairs G-funk with cartoonish giggles and moans that mirror the comic bricolage of Slim Shady-era Eminem the smashed glass and thrusting bass on Feel So Good recalls the Art of Noise’s crude sampling – but they’re subverted by moving musical storytelling and ingenious juxtapositions.On one beautifully innovative song from her debut, Chris paired French singer Christophe’s 1973 hit Les Paradis Perdus with lyrics and melody from Kanye West’s 2008 single Heartless. On the new album, the song 5 Dollars pulls a similar trick with no sampled source material, giving Bruce Springsteen’s hard-won heroism a luminous synth aura and a touch of musical theatre.From Chris’s opening song, she sets out listening as a gesture of intimacy between her and her listeners. The casual snap and darting vocals in the opening verses of Comme Si make it feel as though she’s sizing you up as a potential comrade, before a drum fill worthy of Peter Gabriel launches her into a full-throated, committed chorus. “It’s as if we’re in love,” she sings in French, “when you play me loud,” she continues in English. The middle eight is pure satisfied seduction a salvo that draws you close, preparing to plunge you into the sensations that she sings about.Sometimes, those are lascivious. There’s a wanton decadence to the middle eight of Girlfriend, a realm of pleasure where Dâm-Funk’s priapic keytar solo seems to map the electricity fizzing between Chris’s cries of “baby, baby, baby” and a chorus replying “touché, touché, touché, touché”. The sunken bass and Matrix bullet-time of Damn (What Must a Woman Do) evoke her calculations about what exactly she has to do to satisfy her desires, frustration singeing her voice.More often than not, though, they’re disaffected, reflecting how even a steady sense of self can be undermined by rejection. The silvery, coiled Doesn’t Matter and its stubborn beat sound utterly dejected, even before you note the lyric about “suicidal thoughts”. The usual rush of blood in her vocals – a rarely remarked on strength – pales in The Walker, where she quivers with uncertainty. Moments of sparkling space open up in Goya! Soda!, illuminating her sense of purgatory as she fails to seduce a cavalier young man, who’s “always on my side, but never on me”, as she sings with some anguish.Along with the tragic What’s Her Face, about the lingering scars of bullying, this makes for a sadder conclusion than you’d expect from a record perceived as a raunchy flex. But it’s a truthful one: what if self-belief isn’t always enough, and exposing your appetite repels people? It runs counter to empowerment pop’s current doctrine – love yourself and all is well – and feels all the more truthful for it. Woke pop may be in vogue, but the kind of emotional incisiveness Chris exhibits on her second album is rare, and eternal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af67b54454794bd0c9a0aa195e67312d9c03c037/1174_643_4931_2959/master/4931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55a0797b181a0003a20e6d0649399ba2","title":"theresa may cabinet collectively focused on passing brexit deal","story":"MPs table amendment to finance bill that would prevent cliff-edge BrexitSenior Labour and Conservative MPs are to ramp up efforts to block any possibility of a no-deal Brexit ahead of the vote on Theresa May’s deal, with a plan to mandate the prime minister to extend or cancel article 50 if the prospect of crashing out looms.Efforts were kickstarted on Thursday by a cross-party group of prominent MPs led by Yvette Cooper, who tabled a new amendment to the finance bill that would only allow a no-deal exit if MPs voted to proceed with one.Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said the risks to the UK’s economy and security were “far too high and it would be irresponsible to allow it to happen”.The MP said she believed there was no majority in parliament for a no-deal Brexit. “But if the government won’t rule it out, then parliament needs to find opportunities to stop the country reaching the cliff edge by accident – starting with the finance bill in the first week back, then looking at every other legislative opportunity too,” she said.The amendment has been signed by a number of influential Labour and Tory MPs and is expected to be voted on when the House of Commons returns from the Christmas recess.MPs who have signed include Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, Labour’s Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit committee, Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business committee, the Tory former ministers Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles, and the former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman.The effect of the amendment would be to halt one clause in the finance bill, designed to give the government the power to keep tax law working in the event of a no-deal Brexit.If it were passed, it would mean that clause would only be allowed to come into force if there were either a Brexit deal, a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no-deal Brexit.Should the amendment fail, other bills that could be targeted with amendments include immigration, fisheries and trade.There remains a degree of scepticism, however, as to whether no-deal amendments to those bills would be ruled within the scope of the bill and the decision would ultimately lie with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow.Multiple cabinet ministers have privately and publicly briefed their preferred alternative routes if the prime minister’s deal fails to pass,including a second referendum and a “managed no-deal”.The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, suggested there was a “plausible argument” for a second referendum if parliament could not reach agreement on a deal. Other ministers – including the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt – have suggested the UK could mitigate the effects of no-deal, with Mordaunt suggesting a “managed glidepath” including a two-year transition to trading on World Trade Organization terms.The justice secretary, David Gauke, is understood to have argued that a managed no-deal is “not a viable option”, telling the cabinet on Tuesday: “The responsibility of cabinet ministers is not to propagate unicorns but to slay them.”However, on Thursday the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, said a managed no-deal Brexit was possible, and suggested she had been looking at the option as an “alternative solution” to the deal on offer.In coded criticism of Rudd, Leadsom said: “We won’t have a second referendum. That is not government policy.”May insisted on Thursday that all her ministers were “very clear … what government policy is.”At a press conference in Lancaster House alongside the Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, May said: “Cabinet ministers and I have all been very clear that we are focusing on working on ensuring that we can get the deal that we’ve agreed with the European Union agreed and through parliament in the meaningful vote.”She repeated that the UK was “seeking greater political and legal assurances” on the Northern Ireland backstop.“Everybody is very clear not only what government policy is, but what we are all inidually and collectively focused on is working to ensure that that deal is able to be agreed by and go through a meaningful vote in the House of Commons,” May said.At the press conference, May said the way to avoid no-deal was to persuade MPs to vote for her deal, but she reiterated that EU citizens would have their rights protected in any event.Brussels has said that will not necessarily be reciprocated for UK citizens in EU countries, who may not get long-term guarantees that they can remain there.“I’ve been clear, EU citizens here would have their rights protected in a no-deal scenario,” May said, adding that the Morawiecki had offered a reciprocal guarantee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8616da721e9de60e9c8d22ddc8b11c04a628e403/3_50_3962_2376/master/3962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c512304e56ed49edbeb475ad7d5b95d3","title":"alan solomons worcester different level premiership","story":"It is not yet Christmas and already this is a Premiership season like no other. Even Alan Solomons, Worcester’s much-travelled and vastly experienced director of rugby, cannot recall anything like it. Nine clubs, ranging from fourth-placed Wasps to bottom-placed Northampton, being separated by a mere nine points is not conducive to a relaxing festive period.Hence the tension surrounding Friday’s game between the Warriors and Northampton and Saturday’s Leicester v Harlequins fixture, to name but two. Solomons, now 68, is not quite the oldest coach the Premiership has seen – the 71-year-old Alan Gaffney had a temporary stint in charge of Northampton last season – but he has been around long enough to know the coming months will be relentless for all involved.Solomons should know. During the South African’s brief spell at Northampton over a decade ago the Saints lost eight games in a row. He was relieved of his duties and had to look on from afar as the team narrowly survived in 11th place, with Harlequins going down. Two seasons later, in 2006‑07, Northampton finally dropped into the Championship. The moral of the story? Teamwork, a united dressing room and mental resilience matter as much as talent. “It’s the environment you create that is absolutely vital,” says Solomons, previously in charge of Ulster, Edinburgh and the Stormers and an assistant coach to Nick Mallett when the Springboks went 17 Tests unbeaten in the late 1990s.“My philosophy is to create an environment in which each inidual – and the collective - can realise their potential and be motivated to come to work every day and prepare as best as possible. You’ve also got to have resilience. Life’s about getting up every single time you’re knocked down. Players have got to learn those life lessons. I’ve been around a bit and have seen a few things and it’s part of my job to help them.”For Worcester, with a burgeoning academy, this presents a familiar dilemma. How can hugely promising youngsters such as Ted Hill, capped by England last month, or the forceful teenage centre Ollie Lawrence, be allowed time to develop when the next 80 minutes might dictate their club’s entire future? Solomons believes sealing off the top tier would help all concerned. “If it is ring-fenced, you’re really able to invest in building your club. To some extent that’s to the benefit of English rugby. I think it’s a healthy thing if guys stay in their environment.”Above and beyond the politics of the game the fresh investment deal secured by Premiership Rugby this week and the Warriors’ publicity-shy new owners, the influence of Worcestershire’s answer to Professor Dumbledore will also be crucial. Once a lawyer specialising in litigation, Solomons is not one of sport’s laissez-faire gurus. In the past he has even insisted on teams training on Christmas Day – “That was a bit over the top” – and once refused to allow a club player in South Africa to skip a match to attend his brother’s wedding. His argument was that the ceremony should not have been arranged – “That’s why God invented summer” – for the rugby season.He freely admits there is a widening generation gap between himself and his squad – “My taste in music and theirs is radically different”, he says. But he reckons that certain things never change. “Core values are important to me. Integrity is number one, being altruistic, being a good pro: I find those appeal to whatever generation I’ve coached. I don’t think age is a limiting factor. You just have to be passionate about what you do. If you want to do it for the glamour you are doing it for completely the wrong reason.” When the going gets tough, as it is about to do, nobody will be less fazed than the rugby-mad Solomons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17dba6ddf11f57a264c9d4beb530aad8388921b0/0_147_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e6b99971af7692db4c20b41c67ff13","title":"why im giving up social media for christmas tom price tourist trap bbc","story":"The star of the BBC’s Tourist Trap admits that ‘nobody wants another #Whitstable2017’, so he’s planning a seasonal digital detoxThis Christmas, spare a thought for the thousands of people employed in the advertising industry who have to watch their creative gold being tallied directly against actual sales. It can’t be easy seeing July’s PowerPoint, “Christmas 2018: Our Vision” turned into an actual sentient carrot on our actual televisions.Life’s hard enough as it is for them but it’s getting even worse. Why? Because their dark art of branding, imagery, consumers and aspiration has got new practitioners. Us. You know, the people. You’ve probably seen us about. We’re all advertisers now.

How on earth can professionals possibly compete with this crowd-sourced fakery?I must admit I’ve been fully hooked on Faceswipe, Snapfish and Twinter for years now. I’ve got more platforms than King’s Cross and St Pancras combined, and I absolutely love turning my life into fodder for my subscribersfamilybots. I’m pumping out more photos than the Mars Rover spotting Elon Musk.And yet, as I gear up to broadcast my Christmas Specials to my tens upon tens of followersfamilybots this December, I find something’s missing.It’s some strange muscle memory of what happened last #christmas. It’s such a strange time of year to be on socials. Yuletide clogs up our feeds as people go to Christmas markets (normal markets but with hot wine and products made of fur and wood) to get selfies, Lapland to snap #snow and, of course, funfairs (great way of ridding yourself of any money you don’t want) to get a photo of your child on a snowman carousel that cost £16.Thing is, as I start to line up all this stuff yet again, I feel like I can’t create this fiction any more. Nobody wants another #Whitstable2017.We went there just before Christmas last year. A great place to tweet #Christmasmagic from, without doubt, but unfortunately when we arrived, it rained so much it made Brexit look like a spa day. We were surrounded by cold, damp, bored kids. For three solid, awful days. Thing is, you’d never know that if you’re a Facebook fanfriend of mine. I lied, OK? I just wanted my life to look good, all right? I was only ever after the dopamine hit of the Likes. I’m only in this for the Likes.

Filter: Dramatic Cool. Shots taken: 19. The truth is they had to sit on the sofa because the dog had just vomited up so much dead beach bird that there wasn’t a single square inch of floor you could stand on. Honestly. They looked sad because our tiny fisherman’s cottage smelt like a fisherman’s bin.Two: My youngest son asleep in his pram on the beach. He wasn’t asleep. He was blinking, mid-tantrum.Three: Both sons, and their friends, smiling over big plates of fish and chips. They ate two chips each, for a total cost of £40. I insisted on doggy bags, which I then left in the back of the car for nearly a week.Four: All the children collecting shells. They weren’t they were looking for some money I’d dropped on purpose to make it look like they were collecting shells.Five: My eldest son standing next to a buoy, smiling – a concept I came up with so I could use the catchphrase “Buoy meets boy”. It took 45 minutes to walk out to it, we nearly drowned on the way back, and it only got 18 Likes. Not an acceptable Like-to-risk-of-life ratio.Six: My wife and I in the car, smiling while the two boys sleep peacefully in the back seats.

The SAS serviceman-turned-survival TV guru has put everyone from Kate Winslet to Barack Obama through their paces, but for this festive special, Bear’s Mission with Gareth Southgate (ITV), he is taking the UK’s favourite waistcoat champion on a trek through Dartmoor, to learn how to jump off things, and to talk about the big issues. Whether England fans are prepared for their beloved manager to be subjected to a number of potentially lethal tasks is yet to be seen, but Grylls is not here to show any regard for what’s going to happen in Euro 2020. He is here to push Southgate to the very limit. A polite, nice and gentle limit, with plenty of hot drinks to keep them both warm.Grylls admits he’s a Southgate fan from the off, calling him “a national legend and a hero of mine”, and he is clearly impressed by the manager’s calm and poise. It’s hard not to be Southgate is never anything but charming and humble. If you were to find yourself dumped on Dartmoor without a TV crew and an ex-commando for assistance, Southgate might not be the most practical of companions – he’s still struggling with the shoulder injury that saw him wear a sling last summer – but he would be high on the list for decent company to stave off the madness for a while.Southgate’s grandfather was a commando, so there’s an added emotional element to reprising the kind of training he would have experienced. They set off on a 28-mile trek across Dartmoor, SAS training-style. The action side of things here is always a bit I’m a Celebrity: The Classy Edition, all ramped up helicopter leaps and slippery scrambles, but Southgate is the perfect candidate for it. There’s no posturing or bluster. When he has to walk vertically down a 150ft cliff, facing forwards, his knees are shaking and he looks terrified. “I don’t think the squad would be impressed,” he admits, as he wobbles towards the edge. He steps out uncertainly, and the rocks shift beneath him. “Oh, shit.” Then it cuts to an ad break.Southgate is fine, of course. He makes it down it’s ungainly, but safe. There’s a hamminess to the physical tasks, the potential peril exaggerated with doomy voiceovers and rapid-fire camerawork, but even Grylls isn’t going to risk dropping the most popular England manager in years off a cliff for the sake of ITV’s ratings. Where Grylls’ celebrity pair-ups work best is less in the gung-ho stuff than in the warmth of the conversations, which are often surprisingly revelatory. He is good at getting people to talk, and there’s something about the environment that strips people back to honesty – that, and the relief of surviving being dangled over a ravine on a pully system before having to talk about the big moments in their life.Following a kickabout with his host, roasting their moorland dinner over a fire, Southgate talks about the trademark waistcoat, dismantling theories he has read that the choice was some kind of power-play. He just didn’t want to be too warm in a jacket, and his son said it looked fine, so he went with it. He talks about how he prepared his team for the World Cup: “We wanted to make it fun. We wanted to take the fear away from playing,” which explains how photos of Jesse Lingard and Harry Maguire racing inflatable unicorns across a swimming pool came to be. He talks, too, about that infamous penalty in 1996, and the horrible aftermath, from being shouted at in the street by strangers to carrying the burden of feeling like a national embarrassment. Then, he says, you were left to fend for yourself now, he thinks, if it happened to anyone else, they would be given the chance to talk it through.This is comfort television, undemanding and relaxing (for those without vertigo, at least), from the sweeping shots of Dartmoor to the simple candour of the chats with a man who seems very much as if he deserves all the good will directed towards him. Southgate said he once felt that a 20-year career was remembered only for that single missed penalty. How lovely that he has changed the story, and with such dignity, too. When Grylls hands Southgate an honorary commandos badge, it feels perfectly deserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53a24c1b7f0522e26dce276b213499a31be341b8/692_14_5252_3151/master/5252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33371af799b7169a67835f33f06fab79","title":"talkradio host iain lee suicidal caller phone","story":"Iain Lee talked to ‘Chris’ for half an hour after he revealed he had taken an overdoseRadio host Iain Lee kept a suicidal caller to his show on the line for half an hour while emergency services tracked him down after he revealed he had taken an overdose.The former I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! contestant worked out where the caller, known only as “Chris”, was by asking him a series of questions after he told him he had taken a cocktail of drugs.The caller, who was incoherent and slurring his words, saying he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, told Lee he was in the street near a nightclub, adding: “I do want to die, Iain.”Comedian Lee, 45, who regularly talks about his own mental health struggles, including how he recently experienced suicidal thoughts after coming off antidepressant medication, replied: “Shut up, man, I know you want to die, brother, but I love you. I love you. You may want to die, but we can talk about that tomorrow.”While keeping him talking and working out his whereabouts and appearance, Lee’s producer fed details to the emergency services who raced to help him.The caller, who said he was nearly 60 and had been listening to Lee’s show for around a year, said he was near a nightclub in Plymouth.At points during the call on Wednesday night, Chris fell silent, and Lee grew increasingly concerned for his safety. “Where’s this bloody ambulance? Jesus, come on,” Lee said during the exchange.The host, speaking on his Late Night Alternative show on TalkRadio, added: “Whatever happened, I promise you it can be sorted. I guarantee that whatever has happened, it can be sorted out. It might not be easy.”“This is horrendous,” Lee said at one point near the end of the call after the line went silent again. “Can anyone hear me? Hello, can anyone hear me?” After he heard murmuring on the line, Lee continued: “Chris, you’re still alive! Thank Christ.”After the caller confirmed that he could hear Lee, the host replied: “Yes, brother. The whole country is punching the air. We lost you for about 10 minutes, man.”Eventually, after 27 minutes, police confirmed to Lee that they had found the man. Lee was heard breaking down in tears at the news.After the incident, he tweeted: “Tonight we took a call from a man who had taken an overdose. He was lying in a street in Plymouth, dying.“We managed to keep him online, get a description of what he looked like and was wearing, work out where he was, and send an ambulance and police to him. Kept him on the phone for 30 minutes while he got harder to understand.“Long periods of silence where I thought he’d died. F**k, that was intense and upsetting. Thanks for your kind words. I really hope he makes it.”Devon and Cornwall police inspector Kevin Morley thanked Lee in a tweet, adding: “My officers that attended and are now dealing with the caller. This is a very typical call for us sadly and December is a hard month for many. We will do our best to direct him to long-term support.”Devon and Cornwall police said in a statement: “Police received a call at 11pm last night following reports of concern for welfare of a man near Derry’s Cross, Plymouth. Emergency services attended and the incident was handled by the ambulance crews.”South Western ambulance service said: “SWASFT paramedics were called at 11pm, December 19 to Derry’s Cross, Barbican, by a radio station who were concerned for the welfare of a patient. The male patient was treated at the scene and taken onto Derriford Hospital ED for further treatment.”Lee, who starred in the 2017 edition of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, revealed last month that coming off antidepressants had left him feeling suicidal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bdf834e49b341842eb1760f1f5aed6d0e7defb1/94_0_4423_2654/master/4423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=716f7b90461c7cebbabe4b7bcbdc6661","title":"fridays best tv victoria albert the royal wedding celebrity help the animals at christmas","story":"Marvel at Lucy Worsley’s remarkable reconstruction of Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840Lucy Worsley’s remarkable reconstruction of Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert on 10 February 1840 is filled with interesting revelations, not just about the decorative details of the event but also how it became the forerunner of modern marriage (Victoria was the first to popularise white for brides).

Don’t make the mistake I made, though it’s not one to recommend to your mum.Recommended by Charlie Phillips, head of documentariesBoth my favourites this year involved Kaitlin Prest. In the No, a collaboration with Rabiolab, followed up on her series about her personal history of consent. In it, the Radiolab team spoke to groups engaging with the concept of saying yes and no during sexual situations, with all the knottiness and honesty needed to discuss these things. It really pushed the conversation on.Meanwhile, I loved her newest series, The Shadows, a story of the beginning and the end of a relationship told from different perspectives. I’ve never heard the feelings of infatuation, jealousy and love expressed in such complexity and intensity. I listened to it in various airports around the world and forgot where I was. Recommended by Danielle Stephens, producer, Chips with EverythingBoston station WBUR teams up with Reddit to find the weirdest, wackiest conspiracy theories in the “Redditsphere” and try to get to the bottom of them. They speak to the authors of the original thread, then investigate it by looking at the people who would have been involved, even from decades past. A couple of weeks ago, they looked at the Deadly Double dice game conspiracy to see if an advert that was placed in the New Yorker featuring the game was a warning about the impending attack on Pearl Harbour. Hosted by Ben Brock Johnson and Amory Sivertson, the podcast is cult listening for anyone who is interested in being interested.Recommended by Danielle Stephens, producer, Chips with EverythingCariad Lloyd’s podcast won pretty much every award going in 2018 and deservedly so – it has opened up a conversation about death and how it touches all of us. Standout episodes include Aisling Bea talking about losing her dad and only coming to terms with his death in the past couple of years Ana Matronic talking about trying to get her friends in a very Christian school to understand that her father died of Aids and Robert Webb talking about how those closest to him couldn’t talk to him about his mother’s death even though they should have been the exact people to do it.Recommended by Max Sanderson, lead producer, audioAs Betomania exploded in the buildup to the 2018 US midterm elections, this series offered insight into what that looked like on the ground in Texas. Week by week, the presenter Eric Benson shadowed O’Rourke as he visited key battlegrounds, finding and interviewing an array of characters along the way.Recommended by Katherine Godfrey, head of audioA12 tells the story of the long history and aftermath of one day – 12 August 2017, when a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to a deadly clash between white supremacists and counterprotesters. (Earlier this month, a jury recommended the life imprisonment of the man who rammed a car into protesters that day, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring others.) The show’s presenter, Nicole Hemmer, witnessed the scene and, like many of her interviewees, was left traumatised. She tells the story calmly, but not dispassionately, through emotional and inspiring interviews with witnesses and campaigners. An essential listen that makes us consider how unchecked hatred and ision can take root with horrific consequences.Recommended by Anetta Jones, documentary producerCaliphate offers gripping and often disturbing behind-the-scenes access to both the Islamic State and war-zone journalism. Rukmini Callimachi, the New York Times’s Isis correspondent, is courageous and inspiring as she rifles through diaries, bureaucratic documents and everyday items left behind by the terrorist group after they have fled liberated towns and cities. It is powerfully counterpointed by the compelling testimony of a Canadian former jihadi. I couldn’t stop listening.Recommended by Mythili Rao, producer, Today in FocusThe Cut on Tuesdays is a first-rate, all-female-voices podcast from New York magazine, based on its website of the same name.

Five Women is told with beautiful simplicity and nuance by Chana Joffe-Walt. Each woman – including Vivian, Hazen’s partner – lived and breathed as an inidual, with their backstory central to their experiences.Recommended by Phoebe Greenwood, correspondentIt is a little late to be jumping on the Blindboy bandwagon: the Rubberbandits frontman has been podcasting since October 2017 and has been bobbing around the top of the iTunes chart ever since. But the Irishman is brilliant. The podcast is flamboyantly eclectic, which is probably half the secret to its wide appeal. One episode features him, off his face with a fever, talking about the time he watched a man masturbate with Boyzone in one episode another sees him take on the housing crisis with more journalistic vigour than you would find in most of the best news outlets there is also his humble interview with the civil rights hero Bernadette Devlin and his inspirational and frank talk about mental health. There are heaps of episodes and not a dud among them.

Mattis was reportedly opposed to an abrupt withdrawal and urged the president on Thursday to make the move a gradual one.In the letter, he is frank about the different approaches he and the president had on issues such as the treatment of allies and the US approach to Russia and China.“Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,” he wrote.Mattis said he would stay on until 28 February and would work to ensure a smooth handover to his successor. The full text of the letter is here:I have been privileged to serve as our country’s 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department’s business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong US global influence.One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations’ economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department’s interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability within the Department.I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ff32916695204e1eec30d63fa781756d20c673/0_1096_2217_1330/master/2217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f66636186683027357e0c688c94ea9b5","title":"buckle up for a busy friday on roads says aa","story":"Weekend before Christmas is also likely to be peak time for people flying abroadThe busiest day of the Christmas travel rush is expected on Friday as about 19 million drivers take to Britain’s major roads. Friday will also be the peak time for passengers heading abroad, with Heathrow airport and on Eurostar expected to be especially busy.Gatwick had expected its busiest day to arrive on Sunday, but now could be dealing with a backlog of disruption after drones grounded all flights on Thursday.According to the AA motoring organisation, the combination of the Christmas holiday getaway from work and school, combined with last-minute shopping, will make Friday the UK’s busiest day on the roads, especially in Northern Ireland and the English regions.More than half of the 20,000 drivers it surveyed said they would also travel on Saturday, with traffic tailing off before Christmas Eve.The RAC and traffic analyst Inrix said Friday would see the peak of additional leisure trips for Christmas, bringing an extra 2.8m cars to the roads on top of everyday commuter traffic.It warned of significant delays on the M6 and M40 in particular, with some of the worst tailbacks forecast on motorways in the West Midlands on Friday and Saturday. The anticipated traffic jams could be compounded as rail disruption forces more people on to the roads, the RAC said.As well as the usual railway shutdown for 25 and 26 December, engineering works and strikes will limit some rail services over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Network Rail said it would carry out work worth £148m on 330 projects over the festive holidays, but that the majority of the railway system would be unaffected.However, all lines out of London Paddington will be closed on 23, 24 and 30 December, while work will also close the line between London Victoria and Clapham Junction from Sunday to the new year, meaning that the Gatwick Express will not run. Some Thameslink and East Midlands rail services north of St Pancras will also be affected by engineering.The RMT union is planning to continue strikes on Northern rail each Saturday, as well as South Western railway on 27 and 31 December.Coach operator National Express said it would be adding more than 50,000 extra seats to its services over the festive period, as it is the only national public transport network running on Christmas Day.Around 4.7 million passengers were set to fly abroad on holiday from UK airports over the festive period. Heathrow, Britain’s biggest airport, expects 134,000 of more than 1 million departing passengers to fly on Friday, its busiest day, with New York, Dubai and Amsterdam being the most popular flight destinations.

The green-cheeked parakeets were reunited after weeks of separation, having flown away from their previous owner. They lean into each other as they chew on vegetables hanging from the ceiling, chirpily sharing a cage with several budgerigars and bourke’s parrots.A few blocks away in the dog kennels, Fridolin, a two-year-old dusky pale brown weimaraner, stands on his hind legs and presses his nose against the window of his cubicle. He has been at the sanctuary since mid-October after being picked up on the street.They are just a handful of around 1,400 animals being looked after at Tierheim Berlin, Europe’s largest sanctuary, as they await new homes. But they won’t be moving on before Christmas, after shelters across the country imposed a temporary ban on adoptions.“We just don’t want to see animals being placed under the Christmas tree and then soon after returning to us because the creature turned out not to be such a good idea after all,” says Beate Kaminski of Tierheim Berlin.Scores of animals typically end up back at the shelter in the days and weeks after Christmas as their new owners discover the flaws in their new pets or their incompatibility with busy Berlin lifestyles. Most common are turtles and tortoises, lizards and snakes.The shelters hope their campaign, Animals Don’t Belong Under the Christmas Tree – the German equivalent of the slogan “A pet is for life, not just for Christmas” – will at the very least make people think.In the reptile house, Kay Kieselbach, a keeper who has worked at the shelter for seven years, says he is exasperated by attitudes towards the animals in his care, which include Australian bearded dragons, once en vogue. He says they get discarded for reasons ranging from changes in trends for scale colours to the high electricity costs of heat lamps. A booming online trade in reptiles has only made the problem worse.“We’re keen to raise awareness that animals are just not suitable as presents, often brought on a whim by people who can’t think of what else to buy,” he says. “Never surprise anyone with a pet.”A rhesus monkey, one of the few leftover inhabitants from an East German research laboratory, is playing outside despite the cold. He’s not a likely candidate for adoption, Kaminski admits. Nor are the hundreds of pigeons that have dropped, exhausted, out of races between southern and eastern Europe and are kept on site, nor the pigs and geese, pit bulls and rottweilers. But no less care is shown towards them, she says.“Of course people are looking for the cute ones. Little dogs and kittens – ideally the ones who are going to be the least work. That’s why we put frosted glass on the windows where the kittens live, otherwise visitors would spend the whole day drooling over them.” The shelter takes in between 10,000 and 12,000 animals a year, and its estimated €8m running costs are financed mainly through donations. Set over 16 hectares in Falkenberg, in north-east Berlin, it boasts 173 carers, eight vets and an army of between 500 and 800 volunteers who help with everything from cleaning to taking dogs for walks.Underfloor heating, colour-coordinated suites in the senior cats’ residency – a separate block where noise is kept to a minimum – and an underwater treadmill for dogs with joint problems are among the facilities on offer. There is a separate hut for treating injured aquatic birds such as swans, and even wounded city pigeons have their own tin shack.“We never kill unwanted animals,” says Kaminski, watching a French bulldog who arrived two days ago and has a slipped disc, painfully dragging his legs behind him as he is taken for a walk in the forecourt. She explains that an ethics commission decides if and when an animal should be put down.In this case the dog will probably be operated on, followed by rehab on the underwater treadmill to build up his muscles. Everywhere there are Christmas decorations, including tinsel and stockings in the cat house and a crib by the rabbits’ hutches, as if to try to make up for the fact that these animals do not have homes to go to. The ban will be lifted on 27 December.Jutta Meier, 71, a retired lecturer in German and ethics, found her dream pet just before the ban came into force, paying €200 for a small black and brown crossbreed called Kira“The staff gave me a two-hour interview to check my suitability and will visit my home to check that Kira is happy,” she says. “They couldn’t be more thorough.” She has been given a 10kg bag of dog food and can return for free vet inspections any time.In the aviary, Lisa Galey, cleaning up after her birds, says: “It’s no good surprising a loved one with an animal only to discover after Christmas that it doesn’t fit into your hectic daily schedule.”Her colleague Paula Heindel, agrees. “People need to realise ahead of getting one that animals need cleaning up after them and they don’t always want to cuddle.”The pair feed walnuts to the inseparable parakeets and a two grey parrots, Roger and Willi, who met at the home and appear to have found love together. Roger is even in the process of teaching Willi his former owner’s telephone number and his favourite phrase, “Keine angst” (fear not)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3738691.1545341388!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"just 1 of traveller children go on to higher education","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education has set a target of raising the number of Travellers at third level to 80 by next year, but concedes it may be difficult to achieve this. Image: Higher Education AuthorityJust 1 per cent of Traveller children progress to third-level education compared with more than half of the wider community, latest figures show.The finding is contained in a review of the Government’s plan to boost numbers of marginalised groups in the higher-education system.Overall, the report shows significant progress in increasing participation from people with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds at third level.However, considerable gaps remain, with just 41 Travellers out of a total of about 250,000 people in higher education.The five-year National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2015-2019) has set a target of raising the number of Travellers at third level to 80 by next year, but concedes it may be difficult to achieve this.Elsewhere, there has been strong progress in meeting or exceeding targets with other underrepresented groups.The proportion of students with disabilities has grown from 6 per cent in 2015 to 10 per cent last year. This is well ahead of the 8 per cent target the Government had set for next year.Similarly, the proportion of students from less well-off “semiunskilled manual worker groups” has grown from 26 per cent in 2015 to 36 per cent last year. This is also ahead of the Government’s 35 per cent target set for next year.The proportion of students from the poorest unskilled socioeconomic group has grown at a slower pace, up from 23 per cent to 27 per cent last year.The number of children from disadvantaged (Deis) schools progressing to third level is also on the rise, up from 12 per cent in 2015 to 13.5 per cent last year.However, the proportion of mature students in full-time education has fallen, down from 13 per cent in 2015 to 9 per cent last year. This is well off the Government target of 16 per cent.The plan notes that better employment prospects in the wider economy mean fewer older people are opting to enter higher education.Overall, there has been a 4 per cent increase in participation rates at third level since 2015, up from 51 per cent to 55 per cent last year.When broken down by inidual counties, participation rates in places such as Dublin, Kilkenny, Roscommon, and Wexford respectively largely mirror the State average increase.However, counties such as Kerry, Limerick, Offaly and Sligo each returned considerable increases of about 10 per cent. The report highlights a range of challenges in making further progress, especially in forging stronger pathways from further education and training to higher education.It also notes that progress has been limited in respect of the development of access and foundation courses.

Photograph: Nick BradshawA member of the Traveller community could be appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach to ensure representation of this ethnic group in the Oireachtas, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl has suggested. Mr Ó Fearghaíl said a new Oireachtas committee could also be established to examine problems affecting Travellers, as well as relations between them and the settled community. “We need to look at the possibility of Traveller representation in the Oireachtas which could be achieved in the context of Seanad reform, or through the Taoiseach’s nomination,” he said. The Kildare South TD will bring the committee proposal to the Dáil’s business committee in January, but raised the appointment of a Traveller to the Seanad only as a suggestion. Mr Ó Fearghaíl also suggested a special rapporteur could be appointed to deal with Traveller issues, similar to how Dr Geoffrey Shannon was appointed rapporteur on child protection issues by the Government. “The biggest issues facing the Traveller community are their health and accommodation needs. Their education needs and the fact that something like 80 per cent of Travellers are registered as unemployed,” he said. “They are the biggest issues facing them. But of course the question of the minority of Travellers being involved in anti-social behaviour is a problem you’ll hear about right across the country. Much of it is anecdotal. “I would like to think it would be addressed in an open and transparent way by this committee if we get agreement to set it up.“I think the key issue here is respect and understanding and that is what we need to work out, how do we get greater mutual respect and mutual understanding and that is a two way street. It does involve the settled community but it certainly also involves the Traveller community.”He would not be drawn, however, on whether his proposal followed from controversial comments made Peter Casey in the presidential election campaign earlier this year. Mr Casey, who finished a second to Michael D Higgins, said Travellers should not be recognised as an ethnic minority because they are “basically people camping in someone else’s land”.The Ceann Comhairle traditionally remains above party and other contentious areas of politics.The proposed committee, said Mr Ó Fearghaíl, builds on work already carried out by Independent Senator Collette Kelleher and Labour TD Jan O’Sullivan. The Ceann Comhairle met their informal group and representatives of the Traveller community and said resources are available within the Oireachtas for the new committee because the Committee on Climate Action is concluding its work. The proposed committee would be time limited. It would report within four to six months on issues “that are important to the Traveller community” such as housing, health, education and employment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3738663.1545330998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup deputy leader nigel dodds rails against backstop con trick","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds: “Hypocrisy of those espousing the current withdrawal agreement with its trap of a backstop has been completely exposed.”The Government’s contingency plan for a no-deal Brexit demonstrated that the demands for a backstop to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland are an “utter con trick”, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has said.The MP said Dublin had “admitted” there would be no Border checks on goods, while the European Commission in its planning “avoids spelling out what happens on the Border”.“What does that tell you?” he asked. “Even in the event of a so-called no-deal scenario a hard border won’t happen. The notion that it’s necessary to have a border and checks in the Irish Sea to avoid a Border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is an utter con trick.”The DUP deputy leader said the “utter hypocrisy of those espousing the current withdrawal agreement with its trap of a backstop has been completely exposed”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the Government was not planning for a hard border. But he warned that avoiding one border would be “very difficult” if the United Kingdom quits without a deal in late March.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Government’s “robust” preparations are “a stark indication of the serious chaos that awaits if the UK government fails to get a deal through Westminster”.“This action rightly highlights that the island of Ireland will be disproportionately impacted by Brexit, leaving Northern Ireland sharing a land Border with another EU state. Despite myths peddled by Brexiteers, this leaves Ireland in a very precarious position,” he added.“These plans, in contrast to the weak technical papers issued by the British government and the absence of any action from Stormont, at least acknowledge the state of affairs as they are,” he said. “It is next to impossible that the British government will get a better deal, at least not one that is good for people here. That is why the SDLP have consistently said, that regardless of where we are post-March 29th, the backstop must be in place to protect the future interests of people here.”Director of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland Angela McGowan said a no-deal UK departure would be extremely damaging to businesses across Ireland.“With less than 100 days to go until the UK leaves the EU, it’s time to restore confidence in politics and our economy,” she said. “Politicians on all sides must finally stop the endless infighting of the past 30 months and come together to secure a workable Brexit deal – we’ve all had enough of the chaos.”She also warned that “uncertainty is throttling firms and threatening jobs across the island of Ireland – not in the future but right now. We need to know for certain that a no-deal Brexit will not happen because until we receive assurances on that, damage to investment, jobs and future growth will continue.”“Over 85 per cent of businesses and organisations surveyed in Northern Ireland have made their views clear: a backstop is better than a no-deal scenario,” added Ms McGowan.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin Northern leader Michelle O’Neill repeated her party’s call for a Border poll on Irish unity in the event of a no-deal Brexit.After speaking to Northern Secretary Karen Bradley on Thursday Ms O’Neill said Sinn Féin would continue to work with the Government and other EU members “to protect the Good Friday agreement and protect the backstop against any return to a hard border”.“However, if Westminster insists on a no-deal crash-out Brexit then the only sensible, logical and rational response is the people should have their say in a referendum on Irish reunification in line with the Good Friday agreement,” she said. “This would provide a pathway for the North to be readmitted to the European Union. ”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersThe Government published a long-awaited contingency plan to prepare for a no-deal Brexit late on Wednesday evening because, at this late stage, it had to. London and Brussels started publishing theirs months ago, and the business community, which survives on certainty, was clamouring for more information on how to prepare for this potential worst-case scenario. The political stalemate at Westminster makes no-deal planning a major priority with less than 100 days until the UK leaves the EU. In another sign of increasing pessimism on a deal, the UK government was on Thursday found to be editing its own “no-deal” notices to remove the word “unlikely” in relation to a crash-out Brexit. The Government’s contingency plan makes for bleak reading. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney used the words “stark” and “sobering”. The 133-page plan is long on problems created by a hard Brexit but short on solutions on how to deal with it. The report is a work-in-progress or “a living document”, as the Government calls it, to be updated and developed. The Government identifies well over 200 issues, requiring work across 19 sectors. That is a huge volume of work to do for an event that may not happen and which, the Government still hopes, won’t happen. 1. A hard Brexit would be really badAs has been well forewarned, a disorderly UK exit would be extremely challenging and severe for the State. The contingency plan sets out a plethora of north-south and east-west complications covering trade, food, medicines, flights and policing to be managed with Northern Ireland and Britain outside the EU for the first time in 45 years. A no-deal is painted as “an exceptional economic event” requiring “exceptional measures.” There would be an immediate focus on “crisis management and temporary solutions”. Ominously, the report says planning will involve “difficult and significant choices of a practical, strategic and political nature”. 2. There would have to be lots of new legislationThe Government has identified up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation required to manage life with the UK as a “third country” outside the EU and its vast bundle of laws and rules. In theory, the preference might be for a super Brexit Bill to cover it all, but in practice the aim is to winnow it down to as few Bills as possible. Ministers have been asked to identify essential, non-Brexit legislation so schedules can be cleared out for new Brexit-related legislation. Legislative drafters may be extremely busy from mid-January to Brexit Day on March 29th.3. More land must be purchased at Dublin and Rosslare ports The most detail contained in the report is on the plans to increase activity in customs, border inspections and animal health checks. This will require new buildings at Dublin Port and Rosslare to deal with the new non-EU border with Britain and avoid the expected congestion of lorry traffic. The Government is in the process of buying land at both ports. A temporary site has been identified at Dublin Port given the urgency of the task.1. What happens to the Border?A large “to be decided” sign effectively hangs over the future of the Border in a no-deal world. There is nothing in the report about what would happen to the Border. Coveney has said the Government has no contingency plans for a hard border but stressed that it would be “very difficult” to avoid one without a deal. 2. How will things work on the ground?Who knows? There is scant detail on immediate solutions to cope with no deal. There are lots of references to forums, dialogues and consultationco-ordination groups but little about what they are actually planning to do should the UK crash out. The contingency plan still requires a legally operable text around a no-deal scenario. Business lobby group Ibec, other industry bodies and Opposition politicians have called on the Government to provide more information on how people and businesses would manage day-to-day.The Government will start moving from contingency planning to taking actions if the draft Brexit deal looks no closer to being ratified in London by mid-January. Clearly there are questions that the Government still has no answers to. The Cabinet will discuss more planning at the first meeting of the new year on January 3rd. The feeling in the dark will continue in 2019.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

But the SurgiBox, part funded by the Department for International Development, completely covers a patient and provides a sealed, hygienic area for doctors to work in.“It’s incredibly exciting because SurgiBox creates the opportunity to make safe surgery accessible,” the inventor, Dr Debbie Lin Teodorescu, told The . “It’s not just a good operating room, but a better than state-of-the-art operating room.”The idea is to shrink a whole operating theatre into one backpack. The tent-like enclosure is made of single-use, clear plastic to ensure no cross contamination between operations. A rechargeable battery inflates the SurgiBox in less than two minutes and powers the airflow system to keep it sterile. Once the tent is inflated doctors can work on the patient through armholes. The whole kit weighs less than five kilograms and fits into a 30 litre backpack. Although it can be used for any operation, including caesareans, it has been designed mainly for chest, abdominal and pelvic procedures which are most common in the field. The designers of SurgiBox, which costs as little as £100 to manufacture, say it is a significant improvement on the current drapes used in the field, but at a similar price. It also protects health workers from blood splatters and other bodily fluids. “But our system doesn’t rely on having anything . You don’t even need an operating table. It means surgery can happen anywhere, she added. SurgiBox has been seven years in the making and the current model is the sixth design. Dr Teodorescu came up with the idea while at medical school, after her supervisor told her about the challenges of performing surgery following the Haiti earthquake. The kit has the potential to revolutionise healthcare in conflict zones and humanitarian disasters“As an idealistic student, I thought this seemed insane,” said Dr Teodorescu, “So I started working with the idea of a transportable surgical box, like a glove box. The idea has changed since then, but that’s where the name came from.” But although the design is yet to be piloted in the field, the SurgiBox team hopes to receive regulatory approval for trials by the end of next year. The process will be aided by a US $250,000 (£200,000) grant from the Humanitarian Grand Challenge fund, a joint venture between the UK, US and Netherlands governments. SurgiBox is one of 23 innovations supported by the fund, which will invest a total of £25 million in projects over the next two years. “UK aid is at the cutting edge of research and innovation that will change the way that emergency surgery is delivered in conflict and disaster zones, allowing safe, effective surgery any place, any time,” said Penny Mordaunt, international development secretary. “This is one of several projects from the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, which I initiated with my counterparts at USAID to support and nurture ideas which will allow us to deliver aid more effectively in the future.”Newsletter promotion -

Years of a limited diet for the vast majority of citizens mean that the average North Korean male is just short of 5 feet 6 inches tall, about 2 inches shorter than their counterparts in the South.Please review our commenting policyPolice prepared to shoot down drone as Gatwick re-opens to small number of flights - latest news Winter solstice 2018: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late)Brexit latest news: David Gauke hints at quitting Cabinet if Government backs no-deal Comment: Deal or no deal, London will remain a powerhouse for businessNorth Korea warns it will not give up nuclear weapons until US removes \u0026#39threat\u0026#39Beijing slams reports of forced labour in Muslim detention campsGatwick drone chaos continues into a third dayComment: Republican backlash following scathing resignation of Jim Mattis  should ring alarm bells for TrumpUS plans to withdraw 7,000 troops from AfghanistanThirty years after the Lockerbie bombing those who lost loved ones are still searching for the truthCall me chief nanny if you want, says top doctor as she calls for slew of taxes on chocolate, crisps and sweets\u0026#39You\u0026#39re fired!\u0026#39: Who Donald Trump has sacked and who has resigned during his time as presidentJames Mattis to step down as US defence secretary after announcing he can no longer support Donald TrumpRollerblading model fractured financier\u0026#39s skull after he went through an amber lightScottish NHS chief: People would die if we didn\u0026#39t pay locum nearly £500,000Cristina Kirchner to go on trial for corruption after chauffeur\u0026#39s notebooks reveal bribes paid to businessmenComment: No-deal Brexit would be a risk, but it\u0026#39s the best option we have leftSeagull-sized drone grounds 100,000 passengers and sparks day of chaos at Gatwick airportTate Britain buys Sylvia Pankhurst paintings of working womenEnvironmental protests suspected of orchestrating Gatwick drone chaosWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/21/TELEMMGLPICT000184099935_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"republican backlash following scathing resignation jim mattis","story":"President Donald Trump and James MattisEven by the standards of the Trump administration, it has been an extraordinary 48 hours, culminating in the resignation of Jim Mattis.The consensus is that the departure of the widely-admired Defence Secretary is a disaster, depriving the administration of one of the few grown-ups in the room.If that were not enough, Trump has fallen out with two of his most vociferous cheerleaders, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and ultra-conservative firebrand columnist Ann Coulter.Graham described the President’s decision to pull out of Syria as a “stain on the honour of the US.” Coulter rounded on him for failing to build his long-promised wall on the southern border.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

And it comes as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced plans to resign, citing differences with Trump over the value of America’s alliances and leadership in the world.Trump has long criticised the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan, the longest military conflict in US history and one that has cost about 2,300 American lives. He only reluctantly agreed to his military advisers’ request to allow about 4,000 more troops to be sent to the country last year.Since American troops first arrived in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Sept 11, 2001 terror attacks, the US has appropriated about $126 billion for relief and reconstruction, including $78 billion for security, according to a July report from a Pentagon watchdog. Yet the US presence and funding couldn’t prevent conditions on the ground from deteriorating.US Defense Secretary James Mattis and senior advisor Sally Donnelly arrive via helicopter at Resolute Support headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan April 24, 2017According to the Pentagon watchdog’s reports, the Kabul government’s grip on the country has been consistently shrinking, civilian deaths have been rising and the production of poppy used to make heroin was surging.Publicly, Trump’s national security team has said its approach was effective. During a trip to Afghanistan in July, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo insisted that Trump’s strategy to fight the Taliban was working. Those thoughts were similar to those shared by Mattis, who earlier this year called Afghanistan a “tough fight” but said the American effort “is working from our perspective.”There was an acknowledgement, however, that American firepower could only go so far. The newest commander on the ground, General Scott Miller, said in an October interview with NBC News that the conflict “is not going to be won militarily.”“My assessment is the Taliban also realises they cannot win militarily,” Miller told NBC. “So if you realise you can’t win militarily at some point, fighting is just – people start asking why.”Trump’s decision came hours after the Pentagon published a new quarterly report on Afghanistan that described the military situation as of Nov 30 as being at “an impasse.” The arrival of additional US advisers this year helped slow “the momentum of a Taliban march that had capitalised on US draw-downs between 2011 and 2016,” it said.Afghan forces “remain in control of most of Afghanistan’s population centers and all of the provincial capitals, while the Taliban control large portions of Afghanistan’s rural areas, and continue to attack poorly defended government checkpoints and rural district centers,” it said.The decision to withdraw forces comes as the US tries to broker talks aimed at bringing a more lasting peace to Afghanistan. American officials held talks with Taliban representatives in the United Arab Emirates this week, joined by officials from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the UAE.One sticking point has been the Taliban’s refusal to talk directly with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s government, saying doing so would be a “waste of time” because they see his government as illegitimate.Please review our commenting policyPolice prepared to shoot down drone as Gatwick re-opens to small number of flights - latest news Winter solstice 2018: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late)Brexit latest news: David Gauke hints at quitting Cabinet if Government backs no-deal Comment: Deal or no deal, London will remain a powerhouse for businessNorth Korea urges citizens to make country a basketball powerhouseNorth Korea warns it will not give up nuclear weapons until US removes \u0026#39threat\u0026#39Beijing slams reports of forced labour in Muslim detention campsGatwick drone chaos continues into a third dayComment: Republican backlash following scathing resignation of Jim Mattis  should ring alarm bells for TrumpThirty years after the Lockerbie bombing those who lost loved ones are still searching for the truthCall me chief nanny if you want, says top doctor as she calls for slew of taxes on chocolate, crisps and sweets\u0026#39You\u0026#39re fired!\u0026#39: Who Donald Trump has sacked and who has resigned during his time as presidentJames Mattis to step down as US defence secretary after announcing he can no longer support Donald TrumpRollerblading model fractured financier\u0026#39s skull after he went through an amber lightScottish NHS chief: People would die if we didn\u0026#39t pay locum nearly £500,000Cristina Kirchner to go on trial for corruption after chauffeur\u0026#39s notebooks reveal bribes paid to businessmenComment: No-deal Brexit would be a risk, but it\u0026#39s the best option we have leftSeagull-sized drone grounds 100,000 passengers and sparks day of chaos at Gatwick airportTate Britain buys Sylvia Pankhurst paintings of working womenEnvironmental protestors suspected of orchestrating Gatwick drone chaosWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6258776  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg","title":"bitcoin price surge today latest cryptocurrency usd stock value latest","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

People are looking to reduce their exposure and closing out high risk sell positions before the holidays and this is creating upward pressure on market prices, which is ultimately resulting in a rally.CoinMarketCap)The dramatic price gains come at the end of a disappointing year for Bitcoin, having traded at close to $20,000 (£15,850) in December 2017.The wildly fluctuating price is not unusual for the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, with five previous cycles seeing bitcoin fall by an average of 85 per cent each time.Before the latest recovery, the price of bitcoin was around 83 per cent down on its 2017 high.iStock)Opinion is ided over whether bitcoin will return to its previous highs, with some analysts suggesting that bitcoin will eventually become worthless.\u0026nbspOthers are more positive in their forecasts, including Mr McAfee, who famously predicted that one bitcoin will be worth $500,000 (£396,000)\u0026nbspin 2020.If not, I will eat my d**k on national television, he tweeted in July 2017.

It said the first quarter of 2019 was likely to be similarly weak.BoE warns no-deal Brexit could cause worse recession than 2008 crisisThe Bank raised interest rates in August, citing rising underlying inflationary pressure in the UK economy.It has indicated that rates are likely to rise again next year provided there is a smooth Brexit.And it noted that wages in the UK are now rising faster than it previously expected.But the Bank has also warned that rates could go up more sharply in the event of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal since that is likely to damage the UK’s long-term supply capacity.“The Bank continued to hint that it could conceivably raise interest rates to curb inflation in the event of a no-deal Brexit,”\u0026nbspsaid Paul Dales of Capital Economics.\u0026nbsp“But we and the markets believe it’s bluffing. To limit the temporary fallout to the economy, the Bank would surely cut rates swiftly.”Last month the Bank unveiled worst-case Brexit scenarios for the purposes of stress testing UK banks, which modelled an 8 per cent short-term collapse of GDP,\u0026nbspwith interest rates spiking to 5.5 per cent,\u0026nbspin the wake of no deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Backstage at TechCrunch Disrupt, a tech conference in Berlin, he\u0026nbspadded: “We don’t want to interrupt the learning journey, because it’s not an advertising tool, but we will make sure that if you want this kind of service you can find it.”Babbel has come a long way since it was founded in 2007 by Witte and Thomas Holl, two software engineers with no experience in languages. “When we started out trying to build a better language learning website in 2007, pre App store, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into,” Witte says. “We were three arrogant tech guys saying, this problem is already solved, how hard can it be?”A free iteration of Babbel went online in January 2008 and attracted investors alongside startup funding from the European Structural Fund. But Witte quickly detected an important problem: “You couldn’t learn a language with the thing we had built.”The engineers had built a vocabulary trainer and given it a user-friendly interface. They learned two things: “One, that you would never learn a language off that, and two, you would never make money off it.”So they rebuilt the app from scratch and started asking people to pay. Babbel charges between €12.99 (£12) and €8.25 (£7.35)\u0026nbsp a month, depending on how long users sign up for, unlike its biggest competitor, DuoLingo, which is free.\u0026nbsp“DuoLingo is free, and that’s their problem,” Witte says. “We’ve been there. It’s hard to make money with a free product. I’m not talking about becoming filthy rich, I’m talking about paying your freaking bills! And making sure your people can pay their bills.”Mea Culpa: what is your alibi? Language is changing, your honourAt the same time, Babbel rethought its approach to language learning. Rather than thinking of it as a tech problem, they began to think of it as a human problem. “You can’t substitute the hundreds of years of research and experience that there is in language learning with technology without even looking,” Witte says. “We did that, so I am totally guilty of it. We also made the humble move to say, we were wrong.”Babbel now employs 700 staff, including many language experts. “Tech matters - all the founders are tech people,” Witte says. “We’re totally excited about machine learning and all the fancy stuff out there, but in time we realised that these are just tools. We can be excited about them, but it’s the way you use them that matters.”Babbel originally set out to build an adaptive language learning tool, with exercises put together by machines. But machines aren’t as good at teaching languages as humans and they can throw out random phrases. “Randomness is what as a language learner is pretty off-putting,” Witte says. “So we use stories.”Babbel is using tech to experiment\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspadapting stories without breaking them. The idea is for\u0026nbsptwo people to be able to invest different amounts of time in learning a language and still have a consistent human story to guide them. The tech is used to adapt the programme to the speed of the learner.\u0026nbspThe missing piece of the jigsaw for Babbel is the ability to help the user learn to speak, or to move beyond reading Flaubert and into ordering breakfast. But while Babbel has embraced language holidays, it has no plans to move fully offline and into language schools, Witte says. “We don’t want to get into the language school business, we are not disruptive, we don’t want to eat anyone else’s lunch,” he says. “Many of them are very small, family run and offer a very personal service. To replicate that personal element is very tough at scale and might not be what we’re good at.”Instead, holidays offer a chance for app-users to try out simple conversations that they have practised on the app. Witte remembers using Babbel to learn a few phrases in Turkish before going to a restaurant to order a doner kebab. “They laughed at me, of course they did, but they appreciated the effort,” he says. “It felt good, and that’s the kicker that keeps you going. If you never speak the language, it’s hard to learn.”He adds: “The app can bring you pretty far, but machines are\u0026nbspnot\u0026nbsphuman and never will be. If there is one thing that makes us human, it’s language.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It said the first quarter of 2019 was likely to be similarly weak.BoE warns no-deal Brexit could cause worse recession than 2008 crisisThe Bank raised interest rates in August, citing rising underlying inflationary pressure in the UK economy.It has indicated that rates are likely to rise again next year provided there is a smooth Brexit.And it noted that wages in the UK are now rising faster than it previously expected.But the Bank has also warned that rates could go up more sharply in the event of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal since that is likely to damage the UK’s long-term supply capacity.“The Bank continued to hint that it could conceivably raise interest rates to curb inflation in the event of a no-deal Brexit,”\u0026nbspsaid Paul Dales of Capital Economics.\u0026nbsp“But we and the markets believe it’s bluffing. To limit the temporary fallout to the economy, the Bank would surely cut rates swiftly.”Last month the Bank unveiled worst-case Brexit scenarios for the purposes of stress testing UK banks, which modelled an 8 per cent short-term collapse of GDP,\u0026nbspwith interest rates spiking to 5.5 per cent,\u0026nbspin the wake of no deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”Gustave ​​Doré (Alamy)These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”Alston: Poverty UK\u0027s \u0027biggest challenge\u0027 and\u0026nbspMPs are in \u0027state of denial\u0027 about itWhat frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.’ William Cook meets the artisan at her Hampstead homeClick to followThe IndependentThe French creative tried to fit her art around business for nearly 30 yearsIn Gainsborough’s House in Sudbury, where Britain’s greatest portrait artist was born and raised, there’s a bust of that great artist which captures his personality as well any painting. His expression is quizzical. There’s a\u0026nbsphint of mischief in his eyes. Seeing it for the first time you might suppose it was made 250 years ago – the result of numerous painstaking sittings. In fact, it was made just a few years ago, by the sculptor Nicole Farhi.Nicole Farhi, sculptor? Wait a minute – I thought she was a fashion designer? Well, yes and no. It’s true that she made her reputation with her chic yet comfy clothes, but although her name remains a byword for casual elegance she’s not involved in fashion anymore. Instead she’s making sculpture now, full-time, and in February she has a new show at Gainsborough’s House, in Suffolk, where her Gainsborough bust has pride of place.I know nothing about fashion, but I liked that Gainsborough bust a lot. It was conscientious and unpretentious. The focus was on the subject not the sculptor, the way such sculptures ought to be. So when my friend Tracy wangled me an invite to Farhi’s Hampstead home, I jumped at the chance to meet her. I wanted to find out if her new career as a sculptor was for real. I wanted to know if that Gainsborough bust was just a one-off.She meets me in the doorway of her Georgian house. You wouldn’t know she’s 72. Her huge mane of wavy hair is as thick and wild as ever. Her eyes are bright. Her skin is clear. She’s dressed simply, in white pumps, blue jeans and a blue jumper. On anyone else her age, these plain clothes would look dowdy. On her, they’re stylish. How does she pull it off? A pointless question, no need to ask. She’s a famous fashion designer, after all.She was also an interior designer – everything from furnishing to kitchenware – and so, as you’d expect, her home is pretty stylish too: lots of brightly coloured drapes lots of paintings on the walls lots of books and classy bric-a-brac, and lots of sculptures too. She shows me a bust she made of a friend, sculpted when he was in deep despair, a face misshapen with pain and grief. “He looked so torn – his wife had left him.”\u0026nbspIt’s a world away from her Gainsborough bust, so discreet and delicate by comparison. I never knew her work had such range. I’m pleasantly surprised. I’m also quite impressed.Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarOf course it’s terribly unfair, as I know all too well. My mother is a sculptor, about the same age as Nicole. She’s been slogging away throughout her life, ever since art school, and has never broken through. Yet no one’s life is easy. Nicole’s fame has opened doors, but those doors would soon close again if the work wasn’t any good. Britons distrust polymaths and are suspicious of second careers. It may be a bit easier for Nicole to get to first base with her sculpture. It may be a lot harder for her to get beyond second base.It’s not as if sculpture is a newfound fancy. She’s been hard at it for over half her life – 37 years. She shows me a small torso, the first sculpture she ever made. As she holds it in her hand she tells me how she came to make it. She’d gone to see the sculptor Jean Gibson, to ask if she could be her pupil. “I’ll only take you if you have something to say – otherwise, it’s a waste of time,”\u0026nbspsaid Jean as\u0026nbspshe handed Nicole a piece of clay. Jean told Nicole to sculpt a torso, there and then. When Nicole had finished, Jean took a good look at it. “I’m taking you on – come back on Wednesday,” she\u0026nbspsaid.Farhi also sculpts hands and torsos (Walter van Dyk)“I went to my car and I burst into tears – I was so emotional,”\u0026nbsprecalls Nicole. “You see a door opening to another world. I’m emotional just to think about it.”\u0026nbspAs she retells the story, her eyes well up with tears.It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to changeNo, this is no passing fad. “It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.”\u0026nbspFor over 30 years she had to fit her sculpture around fashion, but then in 2012, she walked away. “Now I sculpt every day.”She takes me to her studio, an orangery\u0026nbspin the garden. There are rows and rows of busts in here, of famous friends: Bill Nighy, Judi Dench, Anna Wintour, Wallace Shawn, Stephen Frears… these busts are full of character. She sculpts hands too, and the torsos of voluptuous women, some of which will be shown at the Beaux Arts London gallery in January. “Large women are beautiful – flesh is wonderful!”\u0026nbspshe exclaims.\u0026nbspThese Rubenesque women are a world away from the models she used to work with during her previous career. “It’s about the sensuality of the flesh, the beauty that large women have,”\u0026nbspshe says. “For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybody.”The artist in her orangery-turned-studio (Julian Jans)Discovering sculpture later on in life has made her determined not to waste a moment. “I don’t have 50 years in front of me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I work every single day, but I don’t mind. I’m so happy that I have been able to stop fashion and just sculpt.”\u0026nbspShe loved art from an early age, and used to paint while she was a student, but when she was young she preferred the whirlwind of the fashion world to the isolation of the artist, so she’s philosophical about the time she’s lost.“Maybe I would not have been serious enough as artist then,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Sculpture is a much slower pace. I can take it now. Probably at the age of 20 I could not.”\u0026nbspAfter 40 years in fashion, she relishes her new seclusion. “I don’t miss the world of fashion at all. I’m very happy on my own here.”For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybodyShe was born in 1946 in Nice, the second of two children. Her parents were Sephardic Jews, immigrants from Turkey. There was no art in her childhood home. “None whatsoever.”\u0026nbspHer father was a gentle man who saw the best in everyone. He sold carpets for a living. “The house was full of rugs.”Her father sounds a bit too nice to be a terribly successful businessman, but she adored him all the same. “My mother always fought with him because she thought he was too kind,”\u0026nbspshe says, “but he was at peace with it – he was a wise man.”\u0026nbspHer relationship with her mother was more fiery, but her mother had more of an artistic sensibility than her father (“my dad never understood what I was doing”) and it was her mother who enabled her to go to Paris to study fashion – her father wanted her to stay at home.One of the reasons she chose to study fashion was because there were no fashion schools close to home. “Nice was a very small town,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I was dreaming of the capital.”\u0026nbspIn Paris, she soon made her mark, not by impressing her tutors but by cold-calling fashion houses, from public telephones in corner cafes, and asking to show them her drawings and designs. For an unknown teenager, that must have taken a lot of confidence, I say. “There was no other way,”\u0026nbspshe replies. “I didn’t think I had anything to lose.”It was in Paris, in 1972, that she met the founder of French Connection, the London fashion retailer Stephen Marks (“a fabulous businessman”). They started working together, became a couple, and had a child together – a daughter, Candice, now a photographic agent in America.‘Flesh is wonderful,’ Farhi says of her subjects (Walter van Dyk)For a few years, Nicole remained in Paris with Candice, but eventually, she decided it would be best for Candice to go to school in Britain, so when Candice was four she brought her to London.She’s lived here ever since, but she still feels French rather than British (she still speaks with a strong French accent) and the clothes that she designed brought a continental flair to British fashion. Yet she had no game plan, no grand design.She was simply doing what came naturally. “I only did what I felt was right for me. I designed looser clothes because that’s what I liked wearing. I didn’t do very short dresses, because I didn’t think that was nice, to look at a girl and only see the thighs – when she’s dressed, of course. When she’s naked it’s a different thing!”Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi sculptures – in pictures  Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 What was it like working with the father of her only child? “It was good and bad because we argued a lot at work,”\u0026nbspshe says. “We were fighting a lot.”\u0026nbspIn the end, they separated, but they kept on working together. “And then things changed completely. We had the best relationship working together once we were not living together, and now we’re still very, very close friends. We had a lot of respect for each other, which we never lost. I think he helped me tremendously at becoming who I was.”\u0026nbspThey’re still close today.In 1992 Nicole married the playwright David Hare, with whom she shares this splendid house. It sounds like love at first sight, and, from the way she talks about him, it sounds as if their love has never faded. Yet they might so easily have never met. Nicole had designed some costumes for Hare’s play, Murmuring Judges, and was invited to the first night party. Yet she had no intention of going until she saw Hare on TV the night before. “He went straight to my heart!”\u0026nbspshe says. Entranced and intrigued, she went to the party, and he made a beeline for her table. “It was the same for him!”The artist working on a bust of Bill Nighy, just one of her famous friends (Julian Jans)“You should have started earlier,”\u0026nbspHare said when he saw her sculptures. Maybe she should have met him earlier, too. When she was a fashion student in Paris, Hare was studying at the Sorbonne. They both used to skip classes to go to the movies, at the same cinemas, and yet their paths never crossed. “We could have been younger, had kids together,”\u0026nbspshe muses. Yet, as she says, quite rightly, there’s no point in crying over what you’ve missed.While Nicole sculpts in the orangery, David writes in his own studio just down the road. For two creative artists in their early 70s, it sounds like an idyllic life. “We don’t meet during the day – he doesn’t come home for lunch,” she says. But they’re obviously besotted with each other. Clearly, a little absence makes the heart grow fonder as the years ebb away.Artist uses robots to create stunning \u0027classical\u0027 sculptures16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarFor the last seven years, they’ve shared the house with Nicole’s mother, who moved in with them at the grand old age of 95. For Nicole, it was a poignant epilogue to a long and turbulent relationship. “She did tell me, perhaps for the first time in her life, when she was 101, that she loved me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Because we fought so much, I was never sure.”\u0026nbspShe died six months ago, aged 102. Nicole shows me the bust she made of her, looking feisty and defiant, but the sculpture that really moves me is of her frail little hand, cast when she was 100.Stephen Marks sold the Nicole Farhi label in 2010. Nicole carried on working there, but it was never quite the same. She left a couple of years later. “I hoped one day I would stop, but I had no idea when that would be. It was only when my company was sold that I realised that was my way out.”\u0026nbspFor her, it was a liberation. When Nicole Farhi went into administration the following year she felt oddly detached from the brand that still bears her name. “It was not upsetting at all,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I could not wait to leave.”No matter. Sculpture is what she does now, and she’s determined not to look back. As she shows me out, she stops to show me the bust of her friend and mentor, the great Italian-Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. “He opened my eyes to everything,”\u0026nbspshe tells me, as we say goodbye. It’s a supremely expressive sculpture, full of life and love and suffering. There are several others I like a lot, but for me, this is the pick of the bunch. Before I met her, I couldn’t quite understand why she’d turned her back on fashion, but now I know she was right to do so. Nicole Farhi used to be a brilliant fashion designer, but that was then and this is now. She’s a proper sculptor now.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues.

Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).No casting announcements have been made yet – the news that a reboot is in development broke on Tuesday.But in addition to Davies (who has recently worked on the Golden-Globe-nominated A Very English Scandal), Stephen Dunn, 29, a Canadian director and writer, is attached to the project as a writer, executive producer, and director.Davies told The\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDunn, inflamed by the current news cycle (including the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and the\u0026nbspelection of Donald Trump), approached him asking why there was no modern version of the show to address recent events.“He wants to make a very new, very accessible show. He had a bit of anger of the world and the status of things, Davies said of Dunn.Red Production Company, which produced the original British version, is also among the executive producers.Bravo, a cable network that belongs to NBCUniversal, is responsible for some immensely popular franchises such as\u0026nbspThe Real Houswives,\u0026nbspTop Chef,\u0026nbspVanderpump Rules\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDirty John.The network is strongly associated with producer and host Andy Cohen, who hosts the late-night talk show\u0026nbspWatch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\u0026nbspand executive produces The\u0026nbspReal Housewives\u0026nbspfranchise.queer as folkEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves.

(RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back.

All fluorescent pinks and greens, completely untouched. He bought it in and put it down carefully next to his chair. Then he said ‘That\u0027s all that I can find of my family’”.After turning to drugs and drink, David died of heart failure in a cheap hostel in Thailand on 29 December 1993, eight days after the fifth anniversary of Lockerbie.Steven became known as “the orphan of Lockerbie”.\u0026nbsp When he died after an accident on a railway line in August 2000, he was described as the tragedy’s last fatality.Far away from Lockerbie, in the English Cotswolds, Dr Jim Swire was at home with his wife Jane.\u0026nbsp They knew their 23-year-old daughter Flora, a neurology PhD student, had booked a last-minute flight to spend Christmas in the US with her boyfriend.Jim was in the study when Jane called to him: “You must come and watch the Nine O’Clock News because there’s been this plane that’s gone down.”Jim had to identify his daughter from the mole on her toe.Grief turned this Eton and Cambridge-educated doctor into a tireless campaigner.\u0026nbspThen 52, he became arguably the face of those grieving for the 43 Britons killed in the atrocity.\u0026nbsp (Lockerbie claimed the lives of people from 21 different nations, including 190 Americans.)Dr Swire lobbied constantly, appealing to the United Nations, exposing the continuing gaps in airport security by smuggling a case of marzipan, which has the same density and appearance as Semtex, onto a transatlantic flight.It still took nearly 12 years before the trial of two Libyan suspects began on May 3 2000, at a specially convened tribunal, operating under Scottish law and heard by three Scottish judges without a jury, at Camp Zeist, the Netherlands.The tortuous road to trial included the imposition of sanctions on Colonel Gaddafi’s Libya, suggestions the international consensus on sanctions was collapsing, and lengthy secret negotiations between the UK, US and the Netherlands, initiated by Tony Blair’s foreign secretary Robin Cook.The investigation that put Megrahi and alleged accomplice Lamin Khalifa Fhimah in the frame had involved interviewing 15,000 people and examining 180,000 pieces of evidence.When the trial began in the Netherlands, Dr Swire was convinced both men were guilty.By the time the judges acquitted Fhimah and found Megrahi guilty on 31 January 2001, Dr Swire was convinced that the only man convicted was innocent.\u0026nbspAbdelbaset\u0026nbspal-Megrahi: the only man ever convicted of involvement in the Lockerbie bombing (Crown OfficePA Wire)He befriended Megrahi, visiting him, exchanging Christmas cards, becoming relentless in his efforts to clear the Libyan’s name, and thus to find his daughter’s ‘real killers’.He had sat through the whole trial, seen for himself some of its more puzzling incidents.Dr Swire had registered the bewilderment of Pierre Salinger, former chief foreign correspondent for America’s ABC network, when the judges thanked him for his evidence and asked him to leave the witness box.That\u0027s all?” asked Salinger, who had interviewed the two suspects.\u0026nbsp “Wait a minute.\u0026nbsp You\u0027re not letting me tell the truth.\u0026nbsp I know who did it. I know how it was done.Lord Sutherland, one of the judges coolly informed him: If you wish to make a point you may do so elsewhere, but I\u0027m afraid you may not do so in this court.The Scottish Crown Office - backed it should be said by many American victims\u0027 families - remains sure Megrahi was a Libyan agent, a key player in a plot where an unwitting Air Malta worker checked the Samsonite onto a Frankfurt-bound flight as a favour for a “friend” in Germany, where the suitcase was routed to Heathrow, then loaded on to Pan Am 103.Tony Gauci, whose shop Mary’s House was near Malta’s airport, identified Megrahi\u0026nbspas the man who bought clothes from him that were later found to have been packed into the Samsonite, concealing the bomb.But there were reports of large undisclosed payments going from the US Justice Department to Mr Gauci.Created with Sketch. Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The suspicion was growing that, either by accident or cover-up, Megrahi had become the innocent fall guy who got a life sentence for mass murder.The Libyan was described, by The Independent among others, as less secret agent and more “Tripoli airport control manager briefly assigned to Libyan intelligence for bureaucratic rather than specialist tradecraft reasons.”Many came to believe the Lockerbie atrocity was the work of Palestinian militants, with suspicion falling in particular on the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front (PPSF) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC).The trial, for example, had heard evidence from FBI agent Edward Marshman that Jordanian bomb maker Marwan Khreesat told him he had supplied the PFLP-GC with explosive devices similar to the one used to down Pan Am 103.By contrast there was considerable scepticism about the prosecution’s attempts to link Libya’s intelligence services to the improvised explosive device that destroyed the jet.A fingernail-sized fragment of circuit board found in the wreckage was identified by prosecutors as being part of a timer made by contractor Thuring and sold by Swiss company Mebo to the Libyan armed forces.But sceptics said independent analysis of the timer fragment showed it had a pure tin coating, whereas Thuring devices were covered in a tin-lead alloy.Dr Swire came to disbelieve the official story of a bomb going from Malta to Frankfurt to London, thinking instead that the bomb had been smuggled through Heathrow and only ever travelled on one aeroplane: Pan Am 103.One Heathrow staff member reportedly told police in January 1989 that he had seen a hard-shell Samsonite in a luggage container heading for the Boeing 747’s hold before the Frankfurt feeder flight that was supposed to have carried the bomb had even landed at the London airport.Some accounts were prepared to accept that Libyan money might have helped fund the Palestinian militants – the US bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 certainly gave Gaddafi plenty of motive for becoming (or continuing as) a terrorist paymaster.But the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by a missile fired in error from a US warship in July 1988 gave another Middle East government a far more recent grievance, one that would have made targeting American civilian air passengers particularly appealing.Whatever the truth, the conflicting accounts and the seeming entanglement with Middle Eastern intrigue left many with the sense that Lockerbie had become a decidedly murky affair.And then, in 2009, things acquired a whole new layer of murkiness.\u0026nbsp Megrahi was released from Greenock prison on compassionate grounds and allowed to return home to Libya.Abdelbaset al-Megrahi died two years and nine months after being released from prison in Scotland on compassionate grounds (Reuters)As the release was sanctioned by Kenny MacAskill, justice secretary in the SNP administration in Edinburgh, officials let it be known that Megrahi was dying from cancer and had only about three months to live.Rather awkwardly for the UK and Scottish administrations, he lived for nearly three more years, dying in Tripoli in May 2012 aged 60.Both the Westminster and Edinburgh governments insisted the release decision had been based purely on the interests of justice, with international power politics having nothing to do with it.But this was happening in the honeymoon period after Tony Blair’s 2004 ‘Deal in the Desert’, sealed with a handshake in Gaddafi’s tent, helping to end sanctions against Libya, while delivering billion-dollar contracts for Western oil companies.A US Senators’ report would later suggest that oil giant BP had lobbied for a prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and Libya. \u0026nbspBoth the oil company and the British government denied that the discussions had specifically mentioned Megrahi.\u0026nbsp At the time of his release, however, one Whitehall source had told The Independent: “It was clear this case is very, very important to the Libyans.”And then the honeymoon with Gaddafi was ended by the Libyan revolution of 2011.\u0026nbsp He went back to being a pariah, the UK joined a bombing campaign against him, and the rebels finished him off after dragging him from a drainage pipe near Sirte.And if anything, the intrigue around Lockerbie deepened.Why, for example, was Colonel Gaddafi’s former spy chief Moussa Koussa, who fled to London during the revolution, allowed to fly on to Qatar after just three days?Andrew MacKinlay, a former Labour MP and member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, remembered meeting Mr Koussa in Tripoli in 2005 and being told by a British diplomat: “This man is up to his neck in Lockerbie”.Mr Koussa remains safely ensconced in Qatar, although he was eventually asked to leave his luxury suite in the Doha Four Seasons.In 2015 Scottish prosecutors effectively re-opened the Lockerbie investigation by naming two Libyans they wanted to talk to: Abdullah al-Senussi, Gaddaffi’s brother-in-law and formerly a senior Libyan intelligence official, and Abu Agila Masud, a man believed to have bomb-making skills.Both men are in jail in Libya.\u0026nbsp Scottish and American prosecutors are said to be hopeful they will be allowed, despite the chaos now bedevilling Libya, to talk to the two suspects.\u0026nbspA report in this week’s Times suggested prosecutors were “closing in” on their two targets.\u0026nbsp The response from the Libyan government – or at least the UN-backed version of it – was said to have been “positive and constructive”.Megrahi’s family, meanwhile, has launched a fresh appeal against his conviction to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC).When he died in 2012, his brother Abdulhakim said: “Just because Abdulbaset is dead doesn’t mean the past is now erased.\u0026nbsp We will always tell the world my brother was innocent.”For his part, Dr Swire described the death of his friend as “a very sad event”.\u0026nbsp He praised the way that Megrahi, even when dying and in great pain, had sought to pass on the information amassed by his defence team.Dr Swire himself is now 82.Thirty years on from being called from his study to watch a TV news bulletin that changed his life, he is still searching for simple, undisputed truth about what happened to his daughter and 269 others.Given what we now know about Lockerbie, it seems rash to assume that anyone will ever find it.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s time that MPs show they won’t allow a no-deal situation to unfold\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsTory and Labour MPs have joined forces to stop Theresa May crashing the UK out of the EU without a deal, starting with a showdown vote early in the New Year.The move – which follows the prime minister ramping up no-deal Brexit planning, as her deal faces defeat – is intended to be the first of many planned ambushes to put parliament in control.“No deal has always been a bad deal. It’s time that MPs show they won’t allow a no-deal situation to unfold,” Nicky Morgan, the former Conservative education secretary, told The Independent.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free readStart your free trialStart your free trialWithout the adsStart your free trialThe group of MPs includes fellow Tories Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles, as well as Labour big-hitters Yvette Cooper, Hilary Benn, Rachel Reeves and Harriet Harman.They have tabled an amendment to the finance bill, to be debated on 8 January, that would prevent any new taxes earmarked for no-deal preparations without the consent of the Commons.Similar amendments are planned to other bills due in the New Year, including on trade, fisheries and arrangements for health treatment in the EU after Brexit.However, the more important aim is to provide a vehicle for the Commons to display its opposition to a no-deal Brexit, preferably before the aborted “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January.Ms Cooper said: “The government should rule out no-deal as the risks to our economy and security are too great.“If they won’t, then parliament must find different ways to avoid no-deal cliff edge instead - starting with this cross-party amendment I’ve tabled to the finance bill for 8 January.”The cross-party coalition follows a refusal by Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, to announce the new date for the meaningful vote, leaving MPs in the dark.Created with Sketch.Brexit betrayal march in London Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester carrying a noose at the Brexit betrayal march.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/30/08/istock-994148670.jpg","title":"wagamama staff to receive 2000 christmas bonus","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But like it or loathe it, Vladimir Putin’s annual press-conference generally creates headlines.\u0026nbspThe 14th edition of this carefully-managed show was no exception, with Putin unexpectedly throwing his weight behind Theresa May’s Brexit plans.\u0026nbsp“The referendum happened,” he said. “What can she do? She should fulfil the will of her nation, as expressed at the referendum. Or it isn’t a referendum.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free readStart your free trialStart your free trialWithout the adsStart your free trialThe Kremlin has been accused of attempting to influence the initial Brexit vote, but that did not deter the Russian president from warning against a second people’s vote.\u0026nbspNot to implement Brexit now would be to repudiate “direct democracy”, he said, adding: “Is it democracy not to care about this Brexit and continue voting until someone is happy with the result?”Overall, Putin presented little in the way of a new agenda. As in previous episodes of the marathon conference, he declared that Russia’s economy was\u0026nbspresilient, the outside world was aggressive, Ukraine was\u0026nbspblinkering on collapse, and his watch would eventually deliver a “technological breakthrough”.\u0026nbspYes, things weren’t always great, he said, but they had been worse. Ten years ago, in the midst of crisis, there was negative growth!\u0026nbspSanctions? What of it? Russia has faced sanctions throughout history. This time, Russia was more than coping. It was the west that was\u0026nbspreally losing.\u0026nbsp“Just look at Spain! They have 15 per cent\u0026nbspunemployment while we have 3.8 per cent!”And what of the disease-ridden landfill sites that have so enraged working class Russians in recent months? Russia would build new recycling plants –\u0026nbspbut remember there are “entire islands of rubbish in the Pacific Ocean”! \u0026nbspAt times, it almost seemed that\u0026nbspPutin was bored and irritated with the format. He only really became engaged when talking about nuclear weapons.\u0026nbspHe repeated promises to build Russia’s strategic arsenal. This, he said, was a response to the US decision to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, and their apparent intention not to renew another cold war arms treaty.“The risks of a nuclear war are growing and underestimated,” he said. “People shouldn’t squeak when we try to add capacity. We aren’t adding capacity, we are preserving balance.”\u0026nbspWeary Putin complains about lack of political competitionOn the main metric of the yearly show – the number of hours journalists are kept inside without food or water – this year fell somewhat short of the record. The press conference lasted just under 4 hours, or 50 minutes short of the 2008 show. \u0026nbspBut it was a record on the attendance count, with 1,700 journalists packed inside the hall. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov made a point of declaring that his staff had gone out of their way to assist foreign journalists in accreditation — unlike the British, he said, who were causing trouble for RT.\u0026nbspOnly those with a criminal record, or “with various illnesses” had been denied accreditation, Mr Peskov said.\u0026nbspAccreditation was not, however, an automatic guarantee of entry. At least one journalist was turned away at the doors of the hall despite possessing the golden hologrammed card. In Roman Dobrokhotov’s case, his crime of identifying the two GRU agents accused of the Skripal poisoning seems to have played against him.\u0026nbspOne affliction that did not bar entry to the hall was\u0026nbspPutinmania.\u0026nbspThroughout the event, journalists were encouraged to shriek to gain the main man’s attention. Some came in fancy dress to stand out (think hockey gear, snow maiden outfits and regional costume). Others bore placards with the name of their region, publication or something more abstract (for example,\u0026nbsp“I’m from the future. Ask me what it’s like there”).\u0026nbspAlmost on cue, they applauded the president, booed\u0026nbspany question that could be deemed too hostile, and lobbed in their own softballs.\u0026nbspSome of the zingers served up today included an offer to go skiing, a long-winded New Year’s\u0026nbspgreeting, and a simple “how are you feeling?”\u0026nbspAs usual, the most interesting questions were the ones that went unanswered and unasked.\u0026nbspThe president sidestepped a question about the role of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a shady associate accused of creating troll farms and private armies, and who has been nicknamed the “president’s chef” on account of his propensity to win state catering contracts.\u0026nbspCabinet splits laid bare as Rudd says new referendum is ‘plausible’“My only cooks are employees of the presidential security service,” the president said.Putin then whataboutised the deaths of three journalists in the Central African Republic, ignoring questions about Mr Prigozhin’s alleged role in the affair. “Journalists are killed in Ukraine too,” he said.\u0026nbspAnd there was certainly no mention about what happened to the two men Putin personally presented as “ordinary Russian citizens”, but were later identified as military intelligence agents Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a Remainer ruse. Except it’s worse than remaining. Norway Plus, aka “Remain Minus”, would destroy the Tories as surely as simply scrapping Brexit.It is far more likely to do so than any number of “no-confidence” stunts like the one Jeremy Corbyn has now pulled in his pathetic desperation for relevance.If Theresa May’s withdrawal deal fails — and Remainer Cabinet ministers would rather sacrice Brexit than swallow a No Deal — they’ll just have to quit.It’s not much of a threat. We doubt voters will miss them.SO much for the “clf-edge No Deal apocalypse” of hysterical Remainer fantasy.

And some reality TV stars set a good example, just as some of our more traditional public figures leave a lot to be desired.It seemed to me that Love Island winners Jack and Dani were quite a moral couple. They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its past experience and thats what my manager is trying to enforce on me.Michael says: But have we caused any problems  Ive only just walked in and I was ordering a glass of Coke, while playing one game of pool.Panning the camera to show his clothes, he continues: As you can see here, Im at work, and youre not concerned Brandon says: Our concern is about safety. Obviously, when we normally get a few people in we normally get more and then we cant... because we end up getting a lot of trouble.The recording stops and Michael says thats when he asked the pub to call police, but they were unable to immediately attend so he left the premises.Speaking to the Sun Online, he said: I could maybe understandit was late at night and ordering alcohol but it was lunchtime.I had a hi-vis jacket on and was asking for a glass of Coke.There was a dog in there and I said so youre okay to have a dog in here but not us  and he told me yeah.It just caught me completely off guard - I couldnt believe it. Ive never experienced something so brazen.It was embarrassing.He added: He came over as we were leaving and said can I apologise  I just didnt know how to deal with it.Well, Im sure he wouldnt have asked any other person to leave because of their ethnic background.Its just completely racist.The pub, which is part of the Charles Wells chain, says it is investigating.A spokesperson for the company said: We take this matter very seriously and will be investigating this ourselves and cooperating fully with the police.As it is a police matter it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage.”Thames Valley Police has been contacted.It comes after a family were refused service at a Hungry Horse pub in Reading, Berkshire, earlier this month - because they were travellers.Michael Connors, , took his we and three children to celebrate his friend’s daughter turning five but was “angry and embarrassed” when he was told the group of four adults and seven children had to leave.He is now hoping to sue the pub, called The Trooper Potts, for discrimination after he accused the manager of being a racist.Hungry Horse said the team member featured in the footage no longer works for the business.A spokesman added: Our teams do have the right to refuse servicethey have reasonable grounds to do so but we are sorryanyone was made to feel uncomfortable.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pig.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit benefit sanctions brexit","story":"BRITS on Universal Credit who miss a job interview may not lose their cash as part of a Brexit shake-up.Benefits sanctions could be abandoned for the time being while officials focus on Brexit, it was reported today.One million people are currently on the new flagship welfare system, which replaces six benefits with one monthly payment.Butclaimants dont meet their responsibilities - such as looking for a job, going to an interview or taking on more work - they can be sanctioned.This means benefits can be slashed for up to three years.But as officials are desperate to get Brexit sorted, benefits sanctions could be abandoned against Brits on Universal Credit, The Times reported today.If you fail to meet each of your responsibilities that you agreed in your commitment without good reason, you will have a cut in your benefit, known as a sanction.This means your Universal Credit payments will be reduced for a set period, and the period of reduction will increase the more times that you fail to meet similar requirements, up to a maximum of  years.There are four sanction levels:You will be sanctioned for  days for your first higher level sanction in any  day period,  days for your second, or  days for your thirdyou:You will be sanctioned for  days for your first medium level sanction in any  day period, or  days for your secondyou have to meet either the:They last until you do whatever you were sanctioned for failing to do, plus  days for your first low level sanction in any  day period,  days for your second, or  days for your thirdyou fail to:These applyyou only have to meet the work-focused interview requirement, and you fail to attend or take part in a work–focused interview, they last until you take part in one.Civil service training could be suspended too, and officials who have retired could be re-hired.Billions of pounds more is being spent on getting government ready for leaving without an exit deal.A DWP spokesperson said they wouldnt comment on speculation, and the department were determined to delivering Universal Credit properly, including sanctions where necessary.The news comes as The Sun launches its Make Universal Credit Work campaign - demanding action from ministers to help those struggling on the new system.We are calling on Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd to slash the wait Brits have for payments, boost the work allowance so people can keep more of what they earn, and pay childcare costs upfront so working parents dont go into debt when going back into work.Today we told how one family face a Christmas without any presents at all as they struggle to pay for bills and food on Universal Credit.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

The Sami tribe were used for long-distance patrol and navigation because of their innate sense of direction and expert skiing skills.In the cold winters, there was a lack of food, so the Nazis ate the tribes reindeer herds.The tale of territory then took another devastating twist when, as Germans grip began to loosen close to the end of WW, the Russians ordered Finland to kick out the German troops.Nazis ate the tribes reindeer for food. There were , German soldiers stationed in Rovaniemi.When they set fire to the town,  per cent of it was burned to the ground, leaving just the chimney breasts standing.During the German occupancy,  died in the town and another  were killed by hidden mines when they ed to their homes.The German Soldiers Graveyard, just outside of the town, holds the remains of , German soldiers who died in Lapland during the war.One of the huge attractions of Lapland is the Northern Lights - otherwise known as Aurora Borealis.While the greenish and red hues are a sight to behold, the mysterious lights are shrouded with years of terrying myths.Tribes in Greenland believe the fleeting and playful nature of the lights - which appear at dferent times throughout the year - symbolise the spirits of dead children.The Sami believe the red lights symbol the ghosts of the murdered, who have continued to bleed in the afterle, or are cutting themselves in the spirit world.Similarly in Siberia, the tribes believed the people who had died were still continuing to live in the skies and that the occasional red lights meant their had been an other-worldly battle and blood shed.It wasnt long until the people of Finland wanted to rebuild their capital, so architect Al Aalto was commissioned with the task.The famous Finnish architect had been responsible for some of Finlands finest buildings but Rovaniemi was a huge challenge.The town contained so much rubble that some locals still find remnants today.Championing the reindeer, which have become as much a part of Christmas tales as Santa himself, Al even designed the town around the sketch of a reindeers head.The streets and roads made the reindeers antlers, and the football stadium became an eye.First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was invited to see the reconstruction and a cabin was built for her arrival.The cabin became a tourist attraction and shortly after the area expanded, becoming Santa Claus Village.Stalls, reindeer rides and Santa sprang up before the first official Lapland flight landed  British tourists in .The post box that was built then still stands, and receives nearly a million letters a year from children worldwide.Father Christmas has been calling Lapland home since , when the host of a Finnish childrens radio programme claimed he was a friend of Santa, and said his home was on a hill shaped like an ear km outside of Rovaniemi.Legend has it that he can hear all childrens secrets.Now, the town makes its entire livelihood from Christmas - even banks have been transformed into magical Christmas palaces, and the airport is rarely accessible outside of Christmas time.The Christmas magic is honed to a fine art, with reindeer safaris, elves and even Santas being flown specically from the UK so theyre knowledgeable on new toy trends on the wish lists.And for the people of Lapland, while their past may be haunted by the ghosts of Christmas past, the future looks much more magical.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bercow can do no wrong so long as he helps her and her pals reverse Brexit.God help us that our politicians have sunk this low.Tory Rachel McLean said: “Read my lips – I do not believe him.”Mr Corbyn, who has repeatedly called for an end to personal abuse in politics, scuttled out of the Chamber as Tory big beast Patrick McLoughlin demanded he apologise.The Labour leader was then snapped watching the events unfold on live TV from the safety of the Commons tearoom.MPs grouped around the Speaker’s chair desperately trying to show him a video of the slur so he could rule on it.But he waived it away – saying he would look at it in private.The Speaker later ed and told MPs that while it was “easy to see” why Mr Corbyn’s words might have been construed as “stupid woman”, “nobody can be % certain, that includes professional lipreaders.”But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “The mask slips. Jeremy Corbyn’s abuse of the Prime Minister shows what a reactionary misogynist he is.”Labour veteran Dame Margaret Beckett had tried to defend Mr Corbyn by saying the Tories were guilty of trying to mount an “orchestrated riot”.But Labour’s Jess Philips had earlier admitted thatright the slur was “sexist” and Mr Corbyn “should apologise”.The Prime Minister had infuriated the Labour leader by mocking his on-off threat of tabling a no confidence vote in her Government.To roars of laughter, she said: “I have some advice for the right hon. Gentleman: look behind you. They are not impressed, and neither is the country.”Mr Corbyn’s spokesman insisted there was no need to say sorry as he hadn’t made the attack. And he said the controversy defied belief given the “national crisis” of Brexit.The Labour leader said: “I referred to those who I believe were seeking to turn a debate about the national crisis facing our country into a pantomime as ‘stupid people’.“I did not use the words ‘stupid woman’ about the Prime Minister or anyone , and am completely opposed to the use of sexist or misogynist language in absolutely any form at all.”The row comes just months after Chancellor Philip Hammond was seen mouthing “stupid woman” at a Brexiteer female MP in chamber too.And ex-PM David Cameron was forced to apologise for telling a woman to “calm down dear!” in the Commons back in .Cherie Blair was overhead at Labour conference in  snapping “that’s a lie” when Gordon Brown spoke of how privileged he felt to have worked with her husband –ex-PM Tony Blair.No. claimed she actually said: “I need to get by.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Such a move, he added, would help those most at risk from a No Deal Brexit “to boost them as they transition”.We’re told in a doomsday No Deal ­scenario that all planes will be grounded and the country will be sold no medicines from abroad.It’s even claimed that our food exports will rot in lorries queued up at Dover, while we starve because no food is being imported via Calais, both of which seem unlikely to happen at the same time.To listen to some campaigners, you’d think there are only three kinds of ­relationship with the EU: Membership, paying the massive bills and swallowing endless laws from Brussels a big, one-size-fits-all deal or a smouldering ruin, cut off completely from trade or co-operation.It might be in their interests to pretend so, because they want to try to frighten us into accepting a poor deal or scare us into abandoning the idea of taking back control altogether. But it isn’t true.Most of the world aren’t EU members, after all, and many countries don’t have trade deals with the EU.Brussels’ rule-by-committee means that trade negotiations with the bloc are slow and have to satisfy a dizzying list of ­special interests.Of the deals that countries have struck with the EU,  dferent types have been hammered out.Anyone who claims there is no flexibility in how we manage our relationship after Brexit is not telling the whole story.But even beyond that, among the many countries who trade with the EU without a deal, the reality does not match up to the black-and-white claim that the choice is either full deal or No Deal.In real le, most countries are quite practical and have the power to reach a whole range of smaller agreements with one another that fall short of a trade deal but still bring benefits.They recognise each other’s driving licences or doctors’ qualications, allow mutual access to their air space, or agree to trust each other’s safety tests on goods rather than hold them up for costly extra testing at their ports.Why do they do it  Because it is in both sides’ interests for trade, tourism and le in general to flow as easily as possible.The US does it, the EU does it, every normal state does it — and there’s no ­reason why we and the EU couldn’t do it, too,it isn’t possible to reach a larger agreement for le after Brexit right now.As Theresa May is finding out, some issues might simply be too dficult or controversial for the UK or the EU to give ground on in the next few weeks.But that should not stop us from ­shaking hands on hundreds of other side deals that both sides could agree quite simply, and which would help both sides to square away.That’s what’s called a “managed no deal” — it might not be either our or their dream outcome but it would make le easier while work continues on overcoming the really dficult sticking points.What’s shocking is the way in which this practical approach has been widely ignored for political reasons.Some of the much-touted “worst-case scenario” forecasts for the supposed cost of Brexit rely on the ridiculous assumption that Brussels and Westminster would do literally nothing to reduce any potential problems from No Deal.We’ve been told repeatedly from some quarters that it is simply impossible for the EU to show any flexibility at all with a non-member, even though it has done so in ious cases.At long last, that lie is being exposed. Just as the UK has released its No Deal preparations, the EU is this week ­publishing details of how it would ­handle that situation.And guess what  Brussels wants to strike mutual side deals in which we both agree to respect ious aspects of each other’s rights in order to limit ­disruption and costs.It turns out there is a practical way ­forward after all, and the doom-mongers’ predictions should be taken with a hefty fistful of salt.Of course a good, wide-ranging, lasting deal is still desirable, and we should keep working to agree one.But there are things we can and should do in the meantime.Better that than be rushed into a ­permanent bad deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the leader of the opposition is a cross between Catweazel and Trotsky we’d have got rid of them long ago.This time the argument is about immigration. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said there are no targets for reducing immigration. The PM immediately responded: “Oh yes there are, baldie.”For once, Theresa May is right. Immigration is a crucial issue and we have been promised time and again — by May herself — that it will be drastically reduced. That’s what the vast majority of the country wants. And the only sensible way to do it is by having targets. You know, something to aim at.We’ve put up with a lot from this Government, maybe too much. If they start backsliding on immigration, that will be it. Down to tens of thousands of people per year, please, as soon as possible. Uncontrolled immigration has made this country almost unrecognisable.We still need to import some talent from overseas. People with good skills and high qualications. What we don’t need are thousands of beggars shoving badly scrawled messages in your face saying “Money Give Now” on the Tube.Nor do we need the thousand upon thousand of unskilled workers picking fruit and veg. Here’s a tip, farmers — pay a decent wage and maybe a few British people will give those jobs a go, huh British businesses have exploited cheap foreign labour for far too long. And the result is an underclass of Eastern Europeans living in desperately squalid conditions, in appalling accommodation.It’s not THEIR fault, by any means. It’s the fault of an immoral system which has seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Cheap EU labour has meant that the wages of the very poorest Britons get undercut. Why on earth the Labour Party supports this exploitation is a total mystery to me.But the other real problem we have is immigration from outside the EU. This easily outnumbers those coming from Europe. I don’t just mean those who say they are refugees but are clearly economic migrants. Although Theresa May could do worse than pledge a halt to that influx, which continues.But we still let in thousands of people from all over the world. They come claiming their brother or cousin lives here and that should give them a right to our benefits and jobs.This has been going on for too long. And it is this immigration which has most changed the face of Britain, in a way many people resent.Here’s the deal, Theresa. Look at Belgium, where the government has just fallen because it ignored the country’s wishes on immigration. So get tough. Put Mr Javid back in his box and set a few realistic targets. Then get to grips with immigration full stop. And maybe we’ll all like you a bit more for it.SOME lesbians are furious.On Coronation Street, the lesbian character Kate Connor tried to seduce . . . a bloke.And the scene got a lot of lesbians up and down the country seething with rage.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

confirmed at the next Spending Review.If we are to secure further defence spending the nation must demand it.So let’s first have an honest conversation with the nation about our current capabilities, the threats that loom ahead and the consequences to our way of lewe do not upgrade.Russia and China know our strengths and weaknesses better than the public does.So we must use the Modernisation Programme to bury the myths that the nation’s relative security is not a given and the international rule book that’s helped keep the relative peace for a generation is now out of date.Russia’s level of aggression remains on the accent.The capture of three Ukrainian ships last month illustrate how they are ever exploiting new ways to assert their influence.Kremlin sponsored bots pollute conversation in democratic nations across the world, and military intelligence service GRU has been caught out operating a series of indiscriminate cyber attacks.Their digital technology is developing at a breath-taking pace.China’s military influence in the East Asia seas and now across Africa continues go advance.Their navy is growing by the size of our Navy every year.And they continue to rush to dominate G, the next generation of cellular technology which will revolutionise our lives.Dominance of data ownership is China’s mission - effectively controlling the internet and the world’s connectivity.We retain the most professional Armed Forces in the world, brilliantly trained and well equipped.But whilst the Royal Navy and RAF have enjoyed some impressive equipment advancements the Army is still using a Main Battle Tank and Armoured Personnel Carrier that’s not been upgraded in two decades.Russia’s on its third iteration in the same timeframe.But its not just in the conventional space where the Defence Secretary wants to invest, but in the domains of cyberspace and space - where the absence of established rules provide the most scope for hostile action.Areas such as AI, autonomy, directed energy weaponscan manoeuvre a hypersonic speeds.They are evolving at an incredible speed and must act to retain our competitive edge.Simply put, without investment in our hard power, we will not keep up an we will unable to respond to this fast changing world.Effectively removing ourselves from that international leadership role which we have prided ourselves for decades.And it is leadership that’s needed to recognise the tried and tested diplomatic instruments and conventions that we relied on to keep the peace are no longer fit for purpose.Exploitation of new technologies is un-regulated.So which nation is willing to step forward a call and help write a new International rule book This is not just a clever call for increased defence spending but a recognition that access to Britain’s physical and digital international markets will need protectingour post Brexit economy is to continue to prosper.The proposal modernise and transform defence will ensure we remain, nog just engaged and committed -

Yet all too often, their needs are ignored.My own family started as blacksmiths in Uttoxeter, Staffs.In , my father, Joseph Cyril Bamford, rented a lock-up garage for  shillings a week.He developed Europe’s first hydraulic tipping trailer for use by local farmers — and then, in , the backhoe loader, the classic JCB digger.JCB — JC Bamford Excavators Ltd — has produced more than a million machines.We have a turnover of more than £billion and factories around the world.Yet we remain a proud ­family business, headquartered in the Midlands and employing thousands of people there.Ours is not a unique success story. Yet it is rarer than it should be.Our main factory in Staffs used to be surrounded by thriving family manufacturers, mostly in the Black Country, Birmingham and Manchester.Over the decades, they have disappeared — because of tax regimes that made it impossible to pass firms on, or takeovers that stripped away what was special about the company, or government mandarins who thought they knew better what industry needed.In Germany, their world-class manufacturing sector thrives because they champion family firms, not least via tax breaks that make it normal for ownership to move across generations.In Britain, the tax system pushes entrepreneurs to sell up, and family businesses find it harder to get finance.No wonder that fewer than  per cent expect to keep their firm in the family.Yet we at JCB still have many excellent family firms among our suppliers — and our customers.In manufacturing, there are more than a quarter of a million family companies, employing more than a million people in jobs that add real value to the community.And such firms are found in every sector of the economy, not just ours.A company such as JCB is big enough to stand up for, and speak for, itself.But too many small firms do not get a hearing in government.Despite the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises — SMEs — are creating almost three times as many jobs as larger firms, it is the voice of the giants that dominates.Yes, these large firms contribute enormously to the economy, but they tend to be the most comfortable with the status quo.They might moan about regulation but they can afford to deal with it, knowing that it deters their smaller competitors.They see Brexit, for example, in terms of costs, rather than opportunities. This is reflected in government.Theresa May’s approach to Brexit was safety-first, focusing on protecting the cross-border supply chains of the multi-nationals.Yet  per cent of British firms do not export. Their main worries are to do with competition and regulation.But regulation, in particular, is harder to addresswe are still following European rules — as is striking new trade deals.Protecting the big companies means reducing opportunities for little ones.I voted, proudly and publicly, for Leave.I believe there is nothing to fear in trading on World Trade Organisation terms, as we at JCB already do — exporting to, and importing from, dozens of countries around the world.But this is not about Brexit. Millions of business owners throughout the country feel they are not represented or spoken for.Polling by Deltapoll recently found that even Tory voters do not think their party is on the side of small business.For the politicians who listen to these firms, the rewards will be political as well as economic.I have spent my le working in a family business.I believe family businesses, of all sizes, are tied to and invested in their communities in a way other firms can never be.And I worry that Britain has a model of tax, regulation and politics in which everything is arranged to suit the big firms on the FTSE, not those that might one day hope to replace them.Whatever the outcome of the Brexit wrangling, we can only succeed long termwe make Britain the best place in the world to start, run and keep a business of your own.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bob, for sure. The sponge with the Bob and the shorts ”At which point, things started getting even weirder for Gino on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show.A programme which, I realise, wasn’t the main television event of the weekend. That was the Strictly Come Dancing final.But so what  It’s Christmas, and after  months largely spent telling you what television shows I don’t like, it seems only fair to celebrate one that I do. Why Simple. Michael McIntyre is one of the very few comedians left on television who realises it’s his duty to make viewers laugh rather than bend and bully them into their left-wing point of view.A noble calling, obviously, but there’d be no point taking this mainstream approachthe resulting show was also cheesy, unprofessional and talked down to its audience.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show falls into none of those traps. Apart from being riotously funny, it’s also clever, charmingly savage at times and ided into three equally slick segments that can all carry an embarrassing musical interlude from Cheryl Tweedy, who stamped around, in elephant leggings, like a mad woman on Saturday’s show.They take it in turns to be the highlight of the show as well. A fortnight ago Bradley Walsh’s send-to-all stunt was the best bit.Last week it was the unexpected-star-of-the-show slot and, at the weekend, it was undoubtedly the Midnight Gameshow with Gino, who had eight stabs before sort of nailing: “SpongeBob with the square pants.”His torment was only just beginning, however, as he was then asked to ID the mystery celebrity singing in his shower.Easy in normal circumstances, but, right on cue, Gino had developed a: “First thing in the morning moment”, and had to shuffle next door with a pillow hiding his embarrassment.If he had the problem, though, Michael McIntyre definitely had the solution.“It’s Sinitta!” he yelled, killing the “first thing in the morning” problem stone dead, which was probably just as well, because he was hugging Boycie from Only Fools And Horses a second or two later.It wasn’t just Gino’s physical responses that were the making of this stunt, though, it was the fact that, having been presented with all this random madness, as well as a goat called Olivia, he asked the single best television question I’ve heard all year.“Are we live ”“LIVE ” responded McIntyre, barely able to contain himself. “It’s one in the morning, Gino.”It’s tempting, then, to describe the whole thing as television perfection.Perfection, though, would’ve involved Gino asking, as he did: “Who comes to houses at this time of the evening ” and McIntyre opening his bedroom cupboard door with a “TA-DA! Paul Young does, Gino.”A Dominatrix on C’s The Sex Business: Pain For Pleasure B Head of Drama at the BBC THE BBC really has created a Sports Personality Of The Year show in the image of its co-host Clare Balding and her all-consuming inferiority complex, hasn’t it A vast and murky event that clearly thinks it’s an adorable, all-inclusive, finger-on-the-pulse, rock ’n’ roll jamboree but is actually a nerdy, uptight, controlling, gender-obsessed, PC quota-thon of the most self-deceiving kind.So Tyson Fury, who has a genuine personality, was excluded from the final six, but Billie Jean King was all over proceedings and England’s Common-wealth Games netball women were apparently the “team of the year”.SPOTY was at its absolute worst, though, trying to do populist, celebrating the all-conquering England World Cup football team , with some BBC-approved patriotism.That is to say, a multi-cultural version of Three Lions, featuring Bhangra dancers, a steel band and a gospel choir, without whom, the BBC presumably imagined, England fans would be goose-stepping round the NEC burning crosses.No one can say for surethis ill-judged segment influenced the final vote, won by Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, of course, but Harry Kane started the night as favourite and ended it third, after something  happened during the song that was so horrendous and disturbing no one who heard the incident can ever mention it or the offender ever again.I hope you’re bloody proud of yourself, David Baddiel.The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote the Keats poem Ode To A Nightingale ”Joe Lycett: “Which American state is home to the Dallas Cowboys ”And  to , Sandi Toksvig: “What five-letter word for a native of one of the Scandinavian countries is also a British name for a root vegetable similar to a turnip ”GOOD Morning Britain, Tuesday Piers Morgan: “The lady who brings our food in has announced she’s quitting.

Mums who are in work often struggle too as they are more likely to be on low pay, with the Government’s national living wage only applying to workers aged  and over. Young women are also more likely to be in low-paid sectors, such as hospitality, care work and catering. Mr Levenson added: “This Christmas, the Government needs to step up to stop people going hungry.  “This means ensuring everyone who wants to work gets the right skills and support to find jobs, encouraging flexible working for parents and carers and paying a proper Living Wage that doesn’t discriminate against age. “This would benefit businesses and the economy too.” A Government spokesman said: “We’re committed to ensuring families get the support they need, and there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with . “Both the employment rate and household incomes have never been higher and there are fewer children living in workless households than ever before. “For those families that need extra support, we are spending pound billion a year on working-age benefits and with Universal Credit, working parents can claim back up to % of eligible childcare costs compared to % on the legacy benefit system.” "},{"url":null,"title":"car seller sends rude buyer","story":"NewsCar seller sends rude buyer on a -mile wild goose chase over discount demandPrankster Rob Keen, , gave the hopeful buyer a random address of Google after he was left stunned with the offer of just £, for the £, carShareCommentsByHannah SmithAbigail OLeary:,  DEC NewsRob Keen was stunned when the cheeky customer began making demands \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA car seller sent a buyer on a -mile wild goose chase after being asked to reduce the price of his Audi by a staggering pound,.

Ben and Olivia Sargent, six and nine, were on a dream family holiday with their mums Kerry and Jules Sargent. But the trip turned into a nightmare on a night out for dinner with friends when Kerry, from Gloucester, was killed in a head-on collision near Whangarei. The children’s other mum, Jules Sargent, was rushed to hospital with serious, le-threatening injuries, some of which it is expected will take her years to recover from, reports Gloucestershire Live. Currently the -year-old is too unwell to travel, leaving her and theirtwo children spending their Christmas in the city of Whangarei in North Island of New Zealand, north of the capital. Although they were not seriously injured, they have been traumatised and deeply scarred by the incident.   Ben has told his mum he can’t remember the good times before the crash. Both he and his sister are being cared for by friends but a GoFundMe page has been set up in a bid to raise pound, and help them create some magical moments that they can all look forward to. It is hoped these will provide light during the darker times. Family friend Alan York said: “Currently, Jules is recuperating in New Zealand with the friends she went out to visit and will need a substantial period of recovery before the family canto England. “Until then, Ben and Olivia have been schooled in New Zealand while Jules undergoes physiotherapy before the doctors can assess whether she is fit enough to take the children on their long journey home.” In the crash, Jules broke her ribs, right leg and two vertebra, and her toes were dislocated. Her left arm was also injured and she has an open wound to her left hip area which also fractured part of the hip bone. She has been told the injury to her left arm could take up to two years to recover from.   Speaking from hospital in New Zealand Jules said: I was so shocked when Alan first told me about the Magical Memories campaign. I didnt think people would respond in this way to our situation, but it is really comforting to know how much people care and want to help my children. They have been through such a traumatic experience as they were initially stuck in the car whilst it was on its roof and had to be rescued by friends smashing the windows to get them out.It was a terrying experience for everyone but Ben and Olivia have shown so much courage throughout this whole situation. I am so proud of them of both. Ben has said ‘he cant think about the good times before the accident all he can remember is the accident.’ This amazing campaign will be used to help them overcome the trauma and create some more happy memories. Mr York added: Jules’ recovery period is expected to be very y and we, as friends of the family, want to help Ben and Olivia get through what will inevitably be some very tough times over the next few years, given how involved their mums were in all aspects of their lives. With your support, we want to help get the whole family safely home back to the UK and give Olivia and Ben experiences that will enrich their childhood and transform their lives for the better after this terrible experience.

Because George, , has vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.He doesn’t know how many more Christmases he will have before he no longer recognises the face of his beloved we Jane and his three grown-up children. And whereas he’s always been the one cooking the turkey and arranging the family board games, now he takes a back seat.“I hate being the Grinch of Christmas,” he says. “So I have to be proactive to escape scenarios that might make that happen.” He is just one of about , people in Britain currently living with a form of dementia and, despite his struggles,George is determined to remain positive and make the most of every day, including Christmas.  “I have to remember I’m one of the lucky ones to actually have a diagnosis” he adds. “Only % of dementia patients do.I can manage my condition with medication and the frustration is much less, knowing what I’m dealing with.” The former English teacher and school business manager had noticed he was struggling with certain things, before he was eventually diagnosed in .“Fteen years ago, I had a double heart bypass. I had two arteries that were clogged around my heart and the implication was that,they’re clogged, it’s likely that others will be, too,” he remembers.“So my risk of vascular dementia, where the blood flow to the brain is restricted, was a real possibility.” He was, in fact, living with dementia for years before the diagnosis.He was finding it hard to remember people’s names at work and to find words “on the tip of his tongue”. And he had increasing dficulty in organising his diary and started having to write everything down.  Eventually, five years ago, George went to his GP, who referred him to the memory service. They diagnosed mild cognitive impairment at the time, but thought it was due to depression and work stress. But George’s condition continued to deteriorate, particularly in his cognitive skills, and he became convinced he had dementia.He was referred for a brain scan, which led to his diagnosis. George, who had a central role in setting up Shropshire Dementia Action Alliance, says despite going through a “black period” for days afterwards, he now finds his dementia “more irritating than anything ”, particularly when it comes to social interactions. And one of these is Christmas.Before his diagnosis, George’s job was to cook the Christmas dinner. “I enjoyed cooking for my loved ones, but I simply can’t any more,” he says.“The thing I really can’t handle is any noise around me in the kitchen, because I can’t cope with the distraction and become so agitated.”  Last year was the first time in  years that he didn’t cook the Christmas dinner. Jane, , an NHS manager, agrees Christmas can feel like another bereavement. She says: “Christmas is really no dferent to any other time of the year, but it does seem more poignant. “It’s worse for the children, seeing the father they know disappearing, changing. It’s hard for them to accept and understand.” And George adds: “I just feel redundant at Christmas now… it’s a reminder that I’m gradually losing myself, that there’s a new reality caused by this fault in my brain. “And because Christmas only comes once a year, it’s so easy to compare this year to last and register the decline.” George, who has made friends with others who have dementia, admits he struggles with general chit-chat and finds some things challenging. “Patterns on carpets and stairs are particularly dficult because my balance isn’t as good as it used to be,” he says. “If I can’t process what that pattern is, I can’t stay upright properly, so I’ll wobble and sometimes fall over.” George says the changes in how his brain works create a prism through which he now views Christmas.But when his children, William, , a junior doctor, nurse Harriet, , and Henry, , a surveyor, and their partners, descend on the house, in Ellesmere, Shrops, for Christmas Day, despite the dficulties he faces,George is determined to enjoy it. “I look forward to Christmas every year,” says George. “In fact, it’s more important than ever to have my family around me as much as possible, as I don’t know how long it’ll be before I don’t remember who is coming to celebrate Christmas... “In fact, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Like many things since my diagnosis, it’s learning to accept and cope with the change in the way I communicate and behave.” With all the cross-talking, shouting and general excitement at Christmas, George knows he has a tendency to withdraw and sit in the corner. Not wanting to seem grumpy, George has decided to “move forwards”, and “teach family members how they can make small changes to help me make the most of every Christmas”. “The commotion around opening presents for me is unbearable” he says. “It takes me a long time to take things in, soI’m being handed a present – which iniably contains a surprise – while someone  is talking about their present and someone is trying to find batteries, I go into shutdown. “So I explain to my family everything needs to be slow, understood and focused. And when I disappear for a walk, they’ll know I just need to clear my head, to get some focus and unwind. It’s all about no surprises, not too much noise and no distractions.Shouting over board games – which we used to do – is out, and the worst possible thing I could do is get drunk. “But Christmas is still the most special time for me, with loved ones and laughter and lovely food.”One-in-four people dies from heart and circulatory diseases in the UK.

He insists that he told staff he did not want to the dog to be fully shaved - but he was horried toover an hour later and find Effy virtually “pink” after having had her body sheared. Pets At Home have said Effy was shaved for her own welfare due to the extent of the matted fur.   Mr Wilks, , from Kingswood in Hull, said: “I told them I did not want her shaving all over. They said she was matted everywhere but she wasn’t as she’d only been bathed and brushed on Monday. “When I saw the state of her I wanted to shout and start swearing but I didn’t – I kept my cool and I said nothing because I just wanted to get out of the store.” After ing home, Mrs Wilks “burst into tears” when she saw her beloved pet before angrily taking to Facebook to rant about the procedure which she likened to “torture” for Effy.   The -year-old beautician said: “We are absolutely distraught, disgusted and gutted [by] what The Groom Room Pets At Home Hull has done to my baby girl! “Her poor bottom has been completely stripped as has all her fur! Please be aware this place is nothing but a Shave Room! “I hope [you’re] happy and would love to get responses and advice from anyone, as I would love to sue them for what they have done! She has been shaking with anxiety since she ed this afternoon! Their attitude in response has been disgusting!” Mr Wilks said he was even more aggrieved after Pets at Home charged him an extra pound to have Effy’s body shaved.  “Originally it was pound but they put an extra pound on for the satisfaction of shaving her all over which I didn’t want done,” the dad-of-two said. “They offered me the deposit back but they said it in such a nonchalant way I thought they were being clever.” Mr Wilks said he and his we, who have used The Groom Room twice before, went to the pet store because their normal dog groomer was on holiday. However, he said the pair will now boycott the shop after Effy’s shaving which has had serious repercussions on the young pup, according to Mr Wilks. He said: “We wanted to get her done for Christmas like anyone would but now we are going to have to take her to the vet because she is constantly shaking and is even defecating inside.  “They have traumatised her and it’s freezing now so she is constantly shivering. She is pink and it looks like she has just come out of an operation. “They said they would have to shave under her legs which was not a problem. I understood that but the last thing I said to them was ‘don’t shave all over.’”What Pets at Home saysA spokesman for the pet supplies retailer, which has more than  stores and , employees, said: “Ourgroomers are highly trained and will always put the welfare of pets first. “When Effy was brought in to our Hull store to be groomed it was explained that, because her coat was heavily matted, particularly around her legs and shoulders, it would have to be clipped close to the skin, purely for the welfare of the dog. “We believe that clipping a matted coat is kinder, faster and gentler for the pet. Effy’s owner, Mr Wilks, was advised of this, including the additional pound matting charge. “Our groomers offered to refund the deposit and not groom Effy, but the customer agreed to go ahead and signed both our clipping policy, and pet grooming salon contract. “We hope that Effy will be happier and healthier with her matted coat now removed and our expert groomers would be happy to helpMr Wilks has any further concerns.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gatwick airport closed live updates","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [ #xCWe advise all customers flying to and from London Gatwick today to check the status of their flight on our Flight Tracker www.easyjet en flight-tracker or via the app.#xCCustomers on cancelled flights, are entitled to a free of charge transfer to an alternative flight and hotel accommodationrequired.

We are still receiving drone sightings in and around the Gatwick airfield.

While some airlines have cancelled all flights up to pm tonight, we would encourage all passengers to check the latest information on their flights directly with their airline or on the Gatwick website.#xCWe are working hard with both the police and Government agencies as we seek to resolve this situation. We know that everyone, including Government, appreciates the severity of the situation and are very grateful for the active role that the police are taking to try and resolve this. We all recognise the urgent need to take the necessary steps that can lead to services getting back to normal as quickly as possible. #xCAlthough not for today, these events obviously highlight a wider strategic challenge for aviation in this country which we need to address together with speed - the aviation industry, Government and all the other relevant authorities. It cannot be right that drones can close a vital part of our national infrastructure in this way. This is obviously a relatively new technology and we need to think through together the right solutions to make sure it cannot happen again.#xCIn the meantime all our focus is on sorting the current challenge and getting services back to normal for passengers. At the moment, I am not in a position to say with certainty when that might be but everyone is doing whatever they can to help make that happen.#xD\",\"author\":[,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news gatwick-airport-closed-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news gatwick-airport-closed-live-updates-\",,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news gatwick-airport-closed-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news gatwick-airport-closed-live-updates-\", Flights are still being erted to other airports, a tweet said.

The runway has now been closed for more than  hours - forcing all departing flights to be grounded and inbound planes to be erted to other airports, including Dublin, Glasgow and Paris.

Heres how passengers or people collecting travellers can do that. The runway was closed shortly after pm on Wednesday and it briefly reopened at about am on Thursday before the drones were spotted again and it once again was closed. The drone was again spotted flying near the runway during Thursday daytime - as police insisted they were doing everything they can to find the suspects and get passengers moving again.

The runway has been closed for more than  hours - forcing all departing flights to be grounded and incoming planes to be erted to other airports, including Dublin, Glasgow and Paris. Whitehall sources said police were investigating the possibility of a lone wolf eco-terrorist being behind the drone attack, according to The . A source said: An eco-terrorist is at this stage a definite line of enquiry. Environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion, who have recently held large scale protests in London, were forced to quash rumours they were involved in the drone activity. They tweeted: Extinction Rebellion is not involved with the drones at Gatwick Airport.  Weve heard there are rumours circulating. We remind people that our actions are always above the ground meaning we stand by our actions, are accountable and take the consequences. No organisation has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Gatwick has told passengers not to travel to the airport for the foreseeable future. The runway was closed at pm last night and it briefly reopened at about am today until the drones were spotted again. One was seen flying near the runway around .am, and police have said they are doing everything they can to find the suspects and get passengers moving again.  Travellers, including pregnant women and children, slept on the airport floor while aircraft wanting to land were erted. Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley said: “There have been a number of sightings - not all of them confirmed - but  sightings since . last evening and we need to work on the assumption that this is a professionally prepared drone. He emphasised during a press conference that “this is a criminal act”. Mr Tingley added that although he does not know the size of the drone, “it’s larger than a domestic drone”.  He added: We don’t know what the drone specication is. “Our working assumption is it’s larger than what someone might buy online, we think it may have been adapted and developed. “We’re working through CCTV footage and trying to identy the make and model.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gatwick airport couple due married","story":"NewsGatwick Airport closed: Couple risk missing own dream wedding amid drone chaosBride-to-be Tayo Abraham and her partner Ope Odedine were due to fly to Marrakesh, Morocco, but the couple and their wedding party have been stuck in London due to the drone mayhemShareCommentsByEmma Bowden:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsBride-to-be Tayo Abrahamsurrounded friends, who are part of the wedding party, at Gatwick Airport \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA couple due to get married in less than two days face another night of uncertainty at Gatwick Airport following flight disruption caused by drones.

Thousands of passengers are currently stranded after two drones were spotted near the runway at Gatwick Airport in West Sussex. Authorities took the decision to close the airport, erting planes already in the air and cancelling many others yet to take off. This remarkable footage, from the University of Dayton Research Institute’s Impact Physics Lab in Ohio, US, shows how even small drones can pose a risk to manned aircraft. It may explain why bosses at Gatwick chose to close the runways and not risk the lives of pilots, crews, passengers or those on the ground.  The research was a comparative study between a bird strike and a drone strike on an aircraft wing, using a drone similar in weight to many hobby drones. A wing was selected to represent a leading edge structure of a commercial transport aircraft. The drone and gel bird were the same weight and were launched at rates designed to reflect the relative combined speed of a fully intact drone traveling toward a commercial transport aircraft moving at a high approach speed.  Kevin Poormon, group leader for impact physics at UDRI, said: “We’ve performed bird-strike testing for  years, and we’ve seen the kind of damage birds can do. Drones are similar in weight to some birds, and so we’ve watched with growing concern as reports of near collisions have increased. And, as the footage shows, the impact was signicant. The drone is almost swallowed by the wing, leaving a huge gaping hole in the structure.Experts say drones could have catastrophic consequencesthey hit aircraft.  Dr Rob Hunter, head of flight safety at the British Airline Pilots Association , said: The public needs to understand that drones are not just toys and could have catastrophic consequencesthey collide with an aircraft. We know a lot of drones will be under peoples Christmas trees and we implore them to ensure theyre aware of the rules and fly their drones in a safe and sensible manner. These drone sightings at Gatwick are further evidence that tougher laws and enforcement are required to keep drones clear of manned flights. BALPA is also calling for the Government to consider toughening the law to create a larger no-fly zone around airports.  We need to ensure people flying drones take responsibility for their actions and do so responsibly with the knowledge thatthey endanger an aircraft they could face jail. Dr Hunter added: Even two kilograms of metal and plastic, including the battery, hitting an aircraft windscreen or engine or a helicopter tail rotor, could be catastrophic. People who buy these devices need to make sure that they know the rules and stick to them, so they dont put anyones le in danger.  Pilots dont want to ruin anyones fun butyou are going to use drones the message is clear: Know the laws or expect serious consequences. Before taking to the air have a really good think about where you are, keep your drone in sight, consider what aircraft might be flying about and keep clear - it is your responsibility. According to the British Airline Pilots Association , there were already  near misses between manned aircraft and drones up until November this year, compared to  for the whole of . This is not the first time an incident involving drones has been reported at London Gatwick. In October, it was reported that a drone put  lives at risk after nearly hitting an aircraft approaching the airport over the summer.

Released on December , LadBabys single We Built This Cityis performed by parenting blogger Mark Hoyle, a man who claims he has never sung before.The charity single is raising money for food bank charity The Trussell Trust and is undeniably an admirable feat. But could his hilarious number really get the top spot   According to the midweek chart update, the UK blogger is currently at number two -  sales and streams ahead of Grande and just  sales behind singer Ava Max, who is currently in the lead. But theres a major issue here. The mid-week chart does not include streaming data from Amazon, Apple and Spoty for Sunday, and also lacks YouTube data for the entire weekend, according to the BBC.  premium video and audio streams count as one sale as do  free video and audio streams. So while sales of We Built This City are strong, a look at its latest performance on streaming s shows the song trailing behind Ariana Grandes. People will cheerfully buy a charity single, chart expert James Masterton explained to the broadcaster. Its a nice, tangible, feel-good gesture. But they wont necessarily listen to it.  LadBabys single doesnt appear in Spotys Top  most played chart, and has over , views on Youtube versus an average of m plays per day of Thank U Next. Given that streaming accounts for a huge proportion of the Official Charts data, this means LadBabys chances are slimmer than they appear in the midweek data.Nevertheless, LadBabys spirits and enthusiasm remain high.Speaking to OfficialCharts about the mid-week data, Mark said: Who would have thought it  A sausage roll song being sung by a Nottingham lad would be sitting at Number  in the Official midweek Singles Chart ! What a fantastic achievement and great start, but lets not stop there!Lets pinch that number one spot from the global mega stars, eat our own body weight in sausage rolls and, most importantly, raise even more money to support the amazing UK food banks charity Trussell Trust this Christmas.

Janusz Jelen would watch Agnieszka Mogilska while he was at work by logging onto a device on his iPhone. Through a speaker he would ask the mother-of-two to raise her arm to seeshe had any fat and to suggest she wear trousers as he claimed her thighs were shaking. He would also eavesdrop on conversations the -year-old was having with her friends. Machine operator Jelen, , has been banned from contacting Ms Mogilska over his oppressive and degrading behaviour.   Police were called in after Ms Mogilska, a production worker at a lighting company said the she felt like she in a mental hospital with  hours a day surveillance. In a statement she said: As a result of this relationship I do not like my body. Im always covering my roll of fat on my stomach by crossing my arms and do not like the fat on my thighs, despite wearing a size . I sleep less and I am exhausted all the time and have been terried since it ended. I was in a domestic violence relationship before with my ex husband and I cant believe this is happening again. I have been struggling since. At Tameside magistrates court, Jelen was convicted at an earlier hearing of an offence of engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour between November  and October this year.   He was given a  week jail term suspended for a year and issued with a  month restraining order. He was also ordered to complete a  month community order plus  hours of unpaid work. He will pay court charges of pound. The couple, who moved to the UK from their native Poland had been dating for two years but arguments began when Jelen laughed at her about her English pronunciation. Miss Mogilska said: At first I felt very happy and loved but then there were allegations made every day that I am fat and stupid and that I didnt know English. He said my children are stupid and that they will be deported back to Poland because they dont know English. He said I would not get help here, the only help I would get isI got with a man who was English. He gave me psychological abuse. I told him I would rather he had hit me in the face because that would stop hurting - but the words dont.   He observed me through cameras, and he told me to lt my arm to see my fat. I put on shorts when it was hot and he followed me, and told me to put on long trousers because my thighs were shaking. I spoke English but he would laugh at my pronunciation. Several times a day he would say things about me or my children. The camera was installed in July . He had an application on his phone which enabled him to watch the camera from work. When I tried to turn it off he would text me to say to put it back on and would watch all the time. I told him I didnt like the cameras and he said that it was there for my safety because he loves me. I felt like I was in a mental hospital with  hours a day surveillance. When my friends came over he was listening to our conversations.   He didnt like some of my friends and tried to cause conflict between me and them which caused one of them to stop seeing me. He tried to say I had other lovers virtually all the time andI went somewhere, he would say I was seeing other people. I did not pick his friends for him so he cannot pick mine. Everyone has rights to have their freedom. I would go out in the day as I didnt want to see him and he works at night. I would go out and it would cause arguments. He said he would kill my other lover and he followed me when I went to the shop. I asked him to take down the camera and do this so we could split up peacefully like human beings but things got worse. We were arguing non-stop and he would then apologise and give me flowers. I was fed up and went to the police.   I did warn him beforehand that I would and he was laughing at me saying no one would help me. I went to the shop which caused an argument and he said you dont go to the shop at this hour. When I went through the door he said I am going to kill you b*tch and him too. I was walking towards the shop and I was on the phone. On the way back my daughter rang me and said he had left home. I felt like someone was following me or watching me. At first I felt very happy and loved. There was a situation when he came in from work before I went to the police. He came in the bedroom as he thought I was sleeping with someone. He took my arm and pushed me and said who the f*** did you sleep with. He wouldnt let me sleep in his bed or the sofa as he said they belong to him.   Jelen, who is currently single, denied wrongdoing. His lawyer Saul Comish said: The cameras had been installed for over a year and there was no complaint for a while. The comments he made were hurtful and the camera was there recording her in the house. But he never controlled her movements or who she could associate with. There are some cultural elements to this as this type of offence is not common in Poland with this type of behaviour. He accepts what he did, he recognises that the relationship is over and has not made contact with her.   But a probation report read to the court said: I believe there are elements of sexual jealousy as motivation for this offence as he thought she was in another relationship and made threats to the other potential male. There is no insight into his abusive behaviour and to some extent there is some sense of entitlement. There is no previous record of abusive behaviour but the offences were over a prolonged period of time. This was his first long-term relationship so he may do this again unless his thinking is changed. Chairman of the bench Jill Simpson told Jelen: We believe you displayed oppressive treatment intended to degrade her. You will need to mody your behaviour.

Today footage has emerged apparently showing the men pledging allegiance to Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, condemning destruction caused by the warplanes of the Crusader alliance. One of the suspects, sitting in front on a black and white flag, is seen brandishing a kne in the chilling footage. The speaker reportedly goes on to say: Keep fighting the enemies of Allah, wherever you are, you have no excuse and, be informed that we are your supporters... you have allies among us. Moroccos general prosecutor has confirmed the authenticity of the video, which shows the men threaten to carry out attacks.   Investigations by Moroccos Central Bureau for Judicial Investigation also showed that the video was made last week before the killing of the two women. The victims were found in an isolated area on the way to North Africas highest peak of Toubkal, officials said. Horric footage of one of the killings has been widely shared on social media in the country, according to reports.Investigators say terrorism was a motive behind their deaths.Danish intelligence said earlier on Thursday that Islamic State could be behind the killings.   The video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organisation Islamic State, the Danish intelligence service said in a statement. This is a case of an unusually bestial killing of two totally innocent young women, it said. One man was arrested earlier this week and three others were arrested on Thursday morning. Police also released pictures of three men they wanted to speak to in connection with the incident. But it is not clear whether it is the same men who have been arrested.  The first man, thought to be Moroccan, was arrested in Marrakesh. He has been dubbed an ‘extremist, Moroccan authorities have confirmed. He was being held in custody to determine the motive of the crime while investigations continue to arrest other iniduals who have been identied and suspected of taking part in criminal acts, the central bureau of judicial investigation in Morocco said in a statement. No organisation or group has come forward to claim the murders.   It is claimed an ID card was found at the scene of the murder. The three men are said to have camped next to the tent belonging to the victims and were captured on camera fleeing the area in the early hours of the morning. We are working to bring before justice three other suspects on the run, said police spokesman Boubker Sabik. The interior ministry said the womens bodies had been found with signs of violence on their necks that had been caused by a cutting device. Louisas mum Helle Jespersen has told local media the family is completely broken. She said: She was always happy and positive, adding that her daughter saw the best in everyone.  Ms Jespersen said she hopes investigators find the culprit, but admitted she is not hopeful. She spoke of the moment she was told about her daughters death by police who turned up at her door. When I went out and saw that there were two officers, I knew what had happened. I broke down, she said.

Since then, he has been living on a strict diet and has lost an impressive lbs - but his weight is still putting him at extreme risk of cardiac arrest. This means he needed further surgery. Juan said: The most important thing for me is to walk again. I haven’t left the house for six years or even walked anywhere.”  Growing up, Juan was always overweight but a bus accident in his late teens left him in a coma and bed bound. He said: I broke half my body. I broke all of my right side ribs, leg, everything.” Over the last couple of years, Juan’s weight-loss progress has been monitored by bariatric surgeon, Dr Jose Castaneda Cruz.He also carried out both surgeries. Juan’s second operation reduced his stomach even further, to create a pouch smaller than an egg. The pouch will bypass his lower stomach and connect to his small intestines. The surgery was le-threatening, but the former worlds heaviest man had no choice. Dr Castaneda said: Death in these patients is likelythey dont get treated we have to risk it because its a le opportunity for the patient. The journey to the hospital was the first time the keen baker had left the house in six months. Juan’s specially strengthened bed had to be dismantled and set up again for him in hospital, as he was too heavy for a normal bed.  The invasive surgery only took an hour and Juan recovered well. He is now on a strict diet and exercise regime to lose a further  lbs in  months. In six months, Juan lost  lbs and now weights under  lbs or  stone - almost half his original weight.His dream of being able to walk again has also come true. He said: Its a really big achievement for me to get up take two, three steps. But I’m very happy you can see Im already starting to move. Juan still needs to lose weight over the next year. But he looks forward to the day when hell be recognised for achieving another world record.

Star striker Pavol Safranko had three decent chances and one of the gilt-edged iety.All were with his head and, given the Slovakian’s obvious quality, it’s a fair betthe same happens on any other day he’ll get on the scoresheet.On top of that, young Matty Smith also saw an excellent effort miraculously saved by keeper Mark Ridgers, meaning on most occasions this was a game that would have been won.Given their dominance of the ball, however, it’s fair to say United should have created more. That they didn’t might be a hangover from previous boss Csaba Laszlo’s year in charge.Like every manager, Laszlo had his own football philosophy and a big part of it was keeping the ball at all costs.Shortly after taking over, he told his players he’d rather they played the ball all the way back to the halfway line than take a gamble and just send it into the opposition penalty box.While the theory behind that is understandable, it led to his team often passing the opposition to death but too often without creating chances, never mind scoring goals.Particularly in the first half up at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium on Saturday, that problem reared its head again. As the manager touched on in his post-match interview, on a string of occasions when they got the ball into the final third, the chance to get it into the penalty box was passed up in favour of a pass back to a deeper lying team-mate.It might just be that, when in advanced areas, taking a gamble and putting in crosses that give the opposition something to defend would be a more fruitful option."},{"url":null,"title":"x factor star to perform in dundee for hogmanay event","story":"A former Scottish X Factor hopeful will be helping to herald in the bells in Dundee on Hogmanay.Ryan Lawrie took part in series  of the X Factor in .He finished in sixth position after being mentored by Nicole Scherzinger as part of the boys’ category.The -year-old made it all the way to the six-chair challenge before being eliminated in week seven.He will appear at Innis and Gunn Beer Kitchen on Hogmanay.Ryan, who hails from North Lanarkshire, started his musical career posting covers on YouTube before being signed to a record company.His first single You’re Free was released in , and rose in the UK iTunes charts to number .Tickets for the event at the Beer Kitchen on South Tay Street cost £ and can be booked through Eventbrite."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

The minister did not seem to realise that many living in my constituency donrsquot feel they have benefited from the city deal and this must change.In his question, Mr Stone said: ldquoA whole shed load of money has been spent in Inverness but precious little has been spent in the out laying areas.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"tough start for new star boss","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content  and access to our full site is  only available on subscription.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million.

The Scottish Government provides around  per cent of councils’ funding so another . per cent reduction will have signicant impact. It means we must focus on what we as a council have a duty to deliver, and reduce the work we do that’s additional to that.#We have to consider, unfortunately, even those services that are valued,they are not a statutory requirement.#Our priority will be as always to make the best possible use of whatever level of funding we receive, We must set our budget in February .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together. But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-college-lecturers-back-strike-action","story":"The Educational Institute of Scotland union said  per cent of members from colleges had backed industrial action following a long stand-off over cost of living increases.

Time for him to get tough.Ms Sturgeons reference to nationalisation, meanwhile, went further than stated SNP policy.In its  Holyrood manesto, the SNP said the party would merely ensure a public sector body was able to bid for a future rail contract, when the franchise lapsed.While in last yearrsquos general election manesto, the SNP said its MPs would argue for the devolution of Network Rail to get ldquoa more effective and efficient rail service.Nor is there a reference to rail nationalisation in the  White Paper on Independence.That said that once the current ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper franchises ran out, the government of an independent Scotland would, ldquounder existing European legislation, have the opportunity to consider all options for the delivery of passenger services, including public sector options, but it did not identy nationalisation as one of those options.That was despite stating the Royal Mail would be renationalised after independence.SNP MSPs also voted against a Labour motion backing nationalisation just last month.Scotlandrsquos railways were last fully in public hands more than  years ago.State-owned British Rail ran them from  to .A gradual Tory privatisation then began in  that transferred them to the private sector by .Mr Sturgeonrsquos comment came after she was pressed by the Scottish Tories about the current misery on Scotlandrsquos railways as a result of hundreds of ScotRail cancellations.Acting Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said punctuality was at its worst for  years, there were staff shortages due to training for a winter timetable, and delayed rolling stock.Askedtrain passengers were owed an apology, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoYes, I do. ScotRail has made it clear that it regrets the cancellations and delays that have been caused. Let me be perfectly clear: the level of cancellations - this week, in particular - has been unacceptable.She said ScotRail caused  cancellations on Monday and around  on Thursday.Mr Carlaw said new official figures showed around  cancellations or partial cancellations a year ldquocaused entirely by ScotRail, despite ministers telling ScotRail to improve.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoProgress is being made but it is not good enough.Mr Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon needed to ensure a train network ldquofit for purpose in .Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokesman was later unable to say what rail nationalisation might cost.He said: ldquoOur position is to pursue a public sector bid. We donrsquot have those [nationalisation] powers. Itrsquos not within our gt to do away with the franchise process.Former UK Labour rail minister Tom Harris, who recently authored a report warning about nationalistion, said: ldquoIf the First Minister believes that rail nationalisation is the answer, shersquos asking the wrong question. Most delays to passengers are caused by publicly-owned Network Rail. Ownership is not the silver bullet that our politicians think it is.ldquoInstead of stating a publicly owned railway would be automatically superior, they should explain what practical measures it would take that the current operator is not.

The deadline for the UK to agree a deal within the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement is Monday January .Mrs May and her colleagues, including David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, have in terms suggested a no-deal Brexit would be ldquochaotic for the UK economy, yet their critics claim - to maximise the chances of Tory, DUP and even some Labour rebel MPs backing her plan ndash they are waiting to the very last moment in a parliamentary game of brinkmanship before accepting, finally, it is dead.As Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, has already suggested the prospect of a heavy defeat on Mrs Mayrsquos Plan could mean it might never be put to MPs.At this point,a no-deal were indeed ruled out, then the PM would be resigned to having to work with Parliament to put before MPs indicative votes on all the main options. The pressure would be on from the likes of Ian Blackford and Vince Cable to put a Peoplersquos Vote on the menu of choices.After another week of parliamentary rock-throwing, a bizarre twist emerged with none other than Vladimir Putin arguing that a Peoplersquos Vote would be - undemocratic.\"Was there not a referendum  Someone disliked the result, so repeat it over and over  Is this democracy  What then would be the point of the referendum in the first place \" asked the Russian President, who secured a  per cent vote to keep him in the Kremlin.David Miliband, the former Labour Foreign Secretary, intervened to brand Mr Putins comments ldquoan insult to the United Kingdom, suggesting the Russian leaders support for the current Brexit deal only strengthened the case for a rethink."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-mays-in-for-a-lump-of-coal-as-santa-decides-whos-naughty-or-nice","story":"Now one had to tread carefully.

A pre-season trip to Japan to collect the fruit had always been a lovely start to celebrations and Mrs Claus adored the bustle of Tokyo after  months of snowy wilderness.The old irritating jingle wasnt quite correct. Mr Claus had very little to do with the compilation of the Naughty Nice lists. Teams of elves performed surveillance on households throughout the year, reporting back to an elven-senate.He had to smile at the reports of parents using him as a method of discipline for boisterous little ones. Didnt the parents know they were being watched too  Such arrogance.Mr Claus had final say-so on which side of the ledger names would fall, checking it twice in that sense, he supposed.The original version of the song included lyrics urging listeners to be charitable towards the less fortunate. These quite rapidly dropped out of circulation. How they could do with being brought back, he thought, as he surveyed the workshops.The elves had ed with stories of banks where hungry families could go to collect parcels of food. They told of people sleeping out on the street because they had no homes to go to.Oh ho, but delivering the Poopsie Unicorn Slime Surprise seemed so frivolous in contrast.\"Remember dear, youre bringing joy to people,\" Mrs Claus would tell him in these moments of reflection. Joy.He quite missed his green suit. Blast that famous cola company and their expert marketing department. Changing his jacket and trousers to red in the s had only served to emphasise the broken capillaries in his nose and cheeks, impossible to avoid when travelling at speed through freezing air.

Even so, it was more useful and instructive as a rehearsal for real le than actual student politics, as conducted by the Studentsrsquo Representative Council or the National Union of Students, which was iniably a kind of gestural Corbynism avant la lettre.Thatrsquos because debate ndash precisely because it is pretence, and not necessarily what you actually believe ndash requires the participants to think critically about the arguments for both sides of the proposition, and be ready to counter objections. When Irsquove said, as I often have, that the First Minister seldom provides any indication of what could be called thinking, I donrsquot mean that shersquos thick, or doesnrsquot consider her strategic options, but that she doesnrsquot habitually engage in that kind of critical evaluation.That, of course, may make her a more effective practical politician. But it gives me pause whenever she says something with which I wholeheartedly agree, as she did the other day. Emerging from Downing Street, where shersquod given the Prime Minister a bottle of Misty Isle gin from Skye for Christmas, she expressed the opinion that the Governmentrsquos immigration policy was ldquoan act of vandalism on Scotlandrsquos economy and public services.Economically, itrsquos straightforwardly empirical: immigration contributes more to the Scottisheconomy than it costs ndash much more. And while Ms Sturgeonrsquos claim that a  per cent reduction in EU migrants would send Scotlandrsquos population into decline and that forecasts suggest a reduction of  per cent is, like all claims about the future, unveriable, it seems plausible.I also entirely agree with her opinion that most immigrants enrich society in ways that may be less obviously measurable in economic terms but may be, for all that, more important. Irsquom thinking mainly of food and music, but you can draw up your own set of cultural priorities.Yet, rather than congratulate myself and Ms Sturgeon on our enlightened opinion, which is clearly the right one, anyone seeking to make that case should ask: what are the objections to this view  Andthey donrsquot seem obvious, why on earth doesnrsquot everyone agree with me Willingness or ability to do that ndash notably on the issues of independence and Brexit ndash seems to be in short supply. But plenty of reasons could be advanced to counter the First Ministerrsquos pronouncements on immigration, however much I may agree with them.The first, and cheapest, is that the proposals drawn up by the Westminster Government are, in general, almost exactly the same as those given in Scotlandrsquos Future, the independence White Paper published in . It too advocated parliamentary control of immigration, robust border controls, a points-based system, assessment of skills, the repatriation of failed asylum seekers, and all the rest of it. It even proposed to dictate which area of the country people could settle in. But to point this out is merely to attack Ms Sturgeon for inconsistency with the stated policies of the party she leads.A politicianmaking all the hay she can out of Brexit, when every point she raises ndash from the legitimacy of a referendum to the dficulty of disentangling laws, or the case for customs unions to unrealistic claims about future prosperity ndash could as easily be applied to independence, is not going to be held back by a little thing like that. In any case, I suppose the SNP could revise its policies in line with what the First Minister says.Whatrsquos trickier is persuading those who donrsquot share the liberal view of the benefits of immigration. The First Minister doesnrsquot subscribe to the economic justication I would advance, which is that ndash as with most things ndash the market is a better regulator of immigration than government and that any fixed targets are counter-productive.Opponents of immigration can be defeated on most economic arguments, because theyrsquore demonstrably wrong. Immigrants arenrsquot a cost to the welfare system, and there are sectors of the economy, including agriculture, catering and the NHS, to which they are crucial. Even the claim that immigration holds down the wages of the poorest is an argument for it as a boon to the economy in general, though not one that anyone left of centre cares to advance.Much of the hostility to immigration, however, has more nebulous causes. Some of it, alas, is simply racism or prejudice, which should always be challenged. But the historical reluctance of politicians to address the subject, assuming that it is always nothing but bigotryis in large part what has inflamed public opinion.Cultural concerns can be real without being racist. Schools where many children speak English as a second language face challenges and costs which, with adults whose grasp of English is poor, also affect the courts and social services. Radical Islamists are a tiny subset of British Muslims, but the danger they present is alarming. The treatment of women by some immigrant communities is at odds with British values, and sometimes laws. The same can be true of drinking habits, or ldquostreet culture.The natural tendency of people to settle in areas where others from their country of origin already live can lead to a placersquos character changing markedly . The refusal of the authorities to take complaints about that seriously can lead to social breakdown. The First Minister need look no further than Govanhill, in her own constituency.I, and I assume Ms Sturgeon, believe that the benefits of immigration, cultural and economic, outweigh these objections. But they deserve more than a glib soundbite and a few tweets. Itrsquos futile to pretend that they are not there, or that they will go away without doing some hard thinking and having a genuine debate."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-corbyn-furore-should-not-obscure-the-fiasco-of-mays-shoddy-brexit-tactics","story":"Caught on the Commons camera, Jeremy Corbyn clearly made a discourteous comment under his breath.

Words, voiced virtually silently and in frustration, were joyously and opportunistically seized upon by screen-watching Conservatives to lambast the Labour leader and to exact retribution on Speaker Bercow, one of their pet hates.This smokescreen of ersion has deflected attention away from the major concerns of that Commons sitting, where the PM used the insalubrious tactics of threatening a No Deal Brexit in her attempts to create momentum for her apology for a Withdrawal Agreement.In addition, more controversy has been thrown into the mix with Mr Corbynrsquos denial that he did in fact speak the words attributed to him by professional lip readers.Theresa May can remain aloof from this gigantic storm in a teacup but undoubtedly she will quietly revel in Mr Corbynrsquos discomfiture.What I would like to ask is which one of us has not uttered silently words of the type, attributed to Mr Corbyn, in moments of sheer frustration  It is only a pity that Mr Corbyn may have compounded the errorindeed he did utter those words, by his denial. Even the words he claims to have voiced, though far from misogynistic , were surely unparliamentary.Denis Bruce, Rannoch Gardens, Bishopbriggs.JEREMY Corbyn denies calling the Prime Minister ldquostupid woman, which watching on TV is what I thought he muttered quite clearly. Outside the Westminster bubble it may look to be simply a storm in a teacup, but it is important as it does involve the believability of the word of a potential Prime Minister. He maintains instead that he said ldquostupid people, which can only mean all thosefacing him on the opposite benches.In the Commons Mr Corbyn is referred to as ldquothe Right Honourable gentleman, and as such we are expected to accept his denial, the implication of which was that he was not criticising the Prime Minister, despite the fact that she was sitting directly facing him and she was the only person with whom he had just been involved in heated debate. More generally,the term ldquostupid woman is unacceptable in the Commons, in these days of equality why is ldquostupid people not also unacceptable as apart from anything  it includes women as well as men Alan Fitzpatrick, Solomonrsquos View, Dunlop.SUGGESTING someone is a stupid woman isnrsquot necessarily misogynistic. Mimicking a pantomime phrase instead of giving a serious response seemed pretty stupid to me. My we, who bore two children on Skye, says Sir Nicholas Soames is a stupid man is she a misandrist Just as well they arenrsquot allowed to throw sticks and stones or they might do each other some real harm. Thank goodness they are kept two sword-s apart.John C Hutchison,Taigh na Coille, Badabrie, Fort William.HOW can the electorate be expected to take our Westminster politicians seriously when we see the kind of behaviour displayed yesterday in the House of Commons  This display demeaned the members of the House, in particular our two major parties. If they had been schoolboys they would have had a detention lasting over the Christmas holidays.We also have the Prime Minister demanding that the SNP MPs back her Brexit plan in the Commons when a large majority of the Scottish electorate voted Remain. Her demands simply show she has lost the plot and simply does not know where to turn for support for her feeble plan.Unfortunately, the Scottish people are the ones who are going to suffer when with the latest farce of an attempt of an immigration policy means we will be short of staff in our NHS, care homes, hospitality and farming. Taking a hard look at what is happening and where we are heading. Do we really want to be a member of this UK club Dave Biggart,Southcroft, Knockbuckle Road, Kilmacolm.THERE are a couple of real challenges with respect to Jeremy Corbynrsquos alleged use of ldquostupid woman or ldquostupid people. Both are within the domain of phonetic analysis. The two major consonants in ldquowoman, ldquow and ldquom ldquo are both labials ndash that is, made with lip contacts. And so are the two dominant consonants in ldquopeople the unvoiced ldquop used to begin the word and in the central phoneme ndash both words have similar dominant labial consonants. Thus lip readers will find it quite dficult to declare categorically what was actually articulated.What was not said by Mr Corbyn was a robust demand for a second referendum. Nowhere on the big red bus did we see the crippling details of the real Brexit rather than the dreamers Brexit. Dragged powerless into a Brexit catastrophe should not be a destiny decided on the opinions of lip-readers.Thom Cross, Needle Green, Carluke.STYMIED in their advice to the Windrush Generation to ldquoget back to Jamaica, the Tories have now turned their guns on Scots from Skye: an innocuous bunch it might have been thought, but no perhaps they are the ldquoA-jockalypse Now generation of Boris Johnsonrsquo snightmares. Maybe he thinks the good yeomen of the shires will be forced into kilts. But who will speak for Scotland when one of our own is insulted According to Jill Stephensonit will not be the elected governing party of Scotland, who also constitute by far the biggest block of MPs. Sothey cannot speak for Scotland, who can  And who can speak for the UK for that matter,the same parameters are in play  Obviously not Mrs May or Jeremy Corbyn.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Most cash was paid to Scottish wind farms, with some earning more than £m a month for not supplying power.Whitelee and its extension on the outskirts of Glasgow, the biggest onshore wind farm in the UK, has received almost a fth of the entire pot since , with payments totalling more than £m to date.Meanwhile, the MW Clyde scheme, near Abington in South Lanarkshire, has raked in more than £m and the Grfin, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire, nearly £m. The amount paid out has been rising annually, despite a new transmission cable to export power from Scotland south of the Border.The fees, known as constraint payments, are paid for by households across the UK.Anti-wind campaigners say spending on constraints has got “completely out of control”, and described expansion of the industry as “reckless”.Lyndsey Ward, who lives in the Highlands, said: “The constraints situation is completely out of control. The Scottish Government is recklessly approving more and more turbines to be connected to a grid that has little hope of managing any power they produce. “The result is an ever-increasing number of turbines have to be switched off and it is the consumer who pays. “Industry also has the wind costs on their energy bills and they add that on to the goods and services they sell us.” The £. billion Western Link interconnector, which became operational last year, runs  miles underwater from Hunterston in Ayrshire to Connah’s Quay in North Wales.It was hoped by exporting power to England and Wales the cable would cut levels of compensation paid to energy firms when Scottish turbines have to be shut down because supply outstrips demand.But faults have seen the cable – a joint project between network operators National Grid and Scottish Power Transmission – unable to operate at full capacity until last month.So far there seems no reduction in payouts compared to the same time last year.Dr John Constable is director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity which first exposed constraint payments to wind generators and publishes data on the costs.He said: “No-one expected the Western Link to be a complete solution to wind power constraint costs, but the continuing level of payments is strikingly high – £m in November, £.m in December so far – raising the question as to whether this very expensive interconnector represents value for money.”Energy regulator Ofgem approved the Western Link project following a cost-benefit analysis that showed it would reduce consumer bills.A spokeswoman for National Grid said: “The Western Link project is playing a vital role in reinforcing the existing UK transmission system … The project is in the early days of operation but will signicantly reduce the levels of constraint payments being made to wind generators.” A spokesman for Ofgem added: “Ofgem sets National Grid, as electricity system operator, strong financial incentives to manage constraint costs efficiently. Overall these costs are less than  per cent of a typical household electricity bill.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845340.1545122767!/image/image.jpg","title":"a brexit carol theresa may haunted by three ghosts paris gourtsoyannis","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...As she tries to save her Brexit deal, what would happenTheresa May got a ghostly visit or three this Christmas, wonders Paris Gourtsoyannis.Theresa May’s Brexit deal was dead. Dead as a doornail.Yet of all the good days in the year, on Christmas eve the Prime Minister still sat in her Downing Street office, the door open that she might keep an eye on her clerks.Gavin Barwell and Robbie Gibb sat in the light of a very small fire, barely visible in the shadows cast by piles of draft Withdrawal Agreements, assurances and side-letters, backstops to the backstop, and flowcharts pointing at dferent fates for May.Hands freezing, backs bent, they scratched out desperate plans to force her deal through the Commons. Scurrying over the floorboards in the dark, damp corners, whips searched for votes.May’s phone vibrated and cast a shaft of light into the darkness – a text. “You don’t have to do this, Theresa. I’m just trying to help. Merry Christmas, TB.”“Nothing has changed!” she wheezed, firing back: “Keep Brexit in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”Leaving her clerks to their work, May climbed the stairs to her apartment to take her melancholy dinner and try and unwind in front of a relaxing episode of ‘Naval Crime Investigation Service ’.No sooner had she nodded off than May was awoken by a clanking, thudding sound on the stairs, growing closer, and louder, relentless and doom-laden, like thecomment section.Through her closed bedroom door a figure appeared, and the blue TV light crackled and leapt as though it cried: “I know him Nick Timothy’s ghost!”The same beardy face, the same name. The chain her former special adviser drew was clasped about his middle and dragged bundles of newspapers.“But Nick,” May whimpered, cowering, “you’re in chains.”“It is required of every man,” Timothy replied, “thatthey are not self-aware in le, then it is condemned to be after death.”The spectre raised a cry and shook its columns. “I wear the chain I made in Downing Street,” it said “I made it line by line, blame by shted blame.“I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate,” Timothy went on. “You will be haunted by Three Spirits.”May awoke with a start, but before she could convince herself it was a dream, light flashed and the curtains of her bed were drawn. She found herself before a strange figure, with a face like child, yet not so like a child as like an old man.“David,” she said, recognising her predecessor. “Are you a spirit, too ”“I am the Ghost of Brexit Past,” David Cameron intoned. “Yours, thankfully, not mine.”She took him by the hand and the pair flew into the past, alighting first at a  meeting with Goldman Sachs bankers, where she warned Brexit would deter investment in the UK, then to a speech where she warned of the risks to EU-wide security cooperation.: Jeremy Corbyn to table no confidence motion in PMBrexit vote date not setOn to her first Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, where she said “Citizens of the World” were really “Citizens of Nowhere”, and then back to Downing Street. “Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek ” For this was where May called an election accusing the EU of undermining Brexit, then lost her majority.May awoke for a second time, and found her bedroom filled from top to bottom with angry men in suits, discussing in the most extravagant and overflowing terms exactly how they were going to dispose of her. “Come in!” exclaimed the weird and not-at-all-jolly giant presiding over the European Research Group. “I am the Ghost of Brexit Present, and we’re going to feed you into a wood chipper.”Issuing bloody threats all the while, the spirit showed May ordinary families ruining their Christmas dinners with arguments about Europe, plotting MPs, fruit crops rotting in polytunnels, and more angry figures in yellow vests shouting about betrayal.“All this is possible thanks to you isn’t it great ” the Ghost said. “Can’t wait to boil you in a pot.”And suddenly, he was gone. Lting up her eyes, May beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming towards her like a mist along the ground that has somehow managed not to be sacked. “Jeremy ” she asked. “But you’re a Remainer!” Jeremy Hunt answered not, but gave a hooded, sepulchral shrug.“Ghost of Brexit that is Yet to Come!” May exclaimed. “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.” And truly, the sights of no-deal Brexit Britain chilled May to the bone.She was transported back to her Commons office, but behind her desk Prime Minister Tom Tugendhat had his head in his hands. His government of national unity, formed in the wake of splits in the two main parties, was collapsing. Amid a stack of resignation letters were demands from Nicola Sturgeon for a Section  order, and calls from Sinn Fein for a border poll in Northern Ireland.In the streets, protesters gathered round skips filled with burning copies of David Cameron’s memoirs for warmth. There were no negotiations with the EU Brussels was in chaos since the far right surged in European elections. Nor was President Pence in a position to offer a trade deal, what with the legal trouble.The spectre took May to conflicts in Ukraine and Yemen, where the UK had given up any pretence of exerting its influence. And they visited China, which continued to suck up production and jobs as the West dismantled the world trade system it had designed. Actually, they went to Japan first before Hunt worked out his mistake.“Good spirit,” May cried when she had seen these things “Assure me that I may yet change these shadows. I will live in the past, present and future. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach!”She awoke with a start again, and knew things were dferent. Flinging open the window of Number , she made a series of unnatural jerking movements, like a jostled shop mannequin about to topple over.“But darling,” cried her husband Philip, “you’re dancing with joy! And only last night you were so despondent.”Beaming, she turned to him. “I know what I have to do.”: Brexit: There’s only one way out of this screw-up – Christine Jardine©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845913.1545206611!/image/image.jpg","title":"how home office is blocking glasgow s efforts to provide true asylum martyn mclaughlin","story":"The Home Office#s intransigent approach to providing housing for asylum seekers is causing anger and mistrust across the country, writes Martyn McLaughlin.Anyone who has paid attention to the Home Office’s thoughtless and negligent approach to housing asylum seekers over the past decade will not be unduly surprised by the latest damning report from the Home Affairs Select Committee.The most obvious question to draw from its primary conclusion – that local authorities across the UK are experiencing a crisis of trust in a broken system – is quite simple. What took so long Britain’s dispersal policy has been unfit for purpose for years. The Home Office’s existing ‘Compass’ contract places the responsibility for housing some of society’s most vulnerable iniduals with multinational conglomerates, some of whom had no prior experience in the complex asylum housing sector. In Glasgow, where Serco has been widely criticised, there have been numerous examples of the initiative’s folly: families forced to reside in properties ridden with vermin and damp, or which lacked essentials such as window panes and heating. Serco’s plan the change the locks on the properties of asylum seekers earlier this summer sparked widespread protests and a legal challenge. Charities and NGOs forced to pick up the pieces have been some of the fiercest critics of Compass, but the new report, published on Monday, shows that councils are fast catching up. With confidence in the entire process waning, MPs have warned that the entire system could soon become untenable.“Nearly two years after our previous report, very little has improved and mistrust by local authorities of central Government has deepened,” the committee noted. “The Government’s handling of the replacement for Compass has led dispersal authorities to consider withdrawal from participation in the dispersal scheme.”In truth, the use of the word replacement is a tad disingenuous renewal would a far more fitting descriptor, given the UK Government looks set to plough ahead with issuing decade-long Asylum Accommodation and Support Servicescontracts. The acronym may be new, but it is Compass in all but name.: Insight: Asylum seekers at breaking point as trauma takes its toll on mental healthThe dissatisfaction over the dispersal scheme is most keenly felt in Yorkshire, but it is proving contagious. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, recently wrote to Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, detailing his misgivings regarding oversight of the dispersal contract, and underlining the need for a fairer distribution of asylum arrivals across the country. Emphasising the gravity of the problems, Mr Burnham warned him that Manchester’s ten local authorities were now “seriously considering” their continued participation in the scheme. Fortunately, especially for the ,-plus asylum seekers in Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow City Council is not inclined to follow suit. It was one of the first cities in the UK after London to join the dispersal scheme and for nearly  years, it has taken great pride in its participation.The city, in turn, has benefited immeasurably. In the space of a generation, its communities and culture have been enriched and Glasgow’s reputation as a welcoming city has been enhanced. The SNP administration knows this only too well, and it is keen to continue with the dispersal programme,not the precise arrangements put in place by the Home Office. When Glasgow first became part of the initiative, it was the city council itself which was the contract holder. All these years later, and in light of the disastrous Compass contract, the council was minded to take over the reins for AASC. : Brian Wilson: Serco right about one thing in asylum seeker eviction rowAfter making a formal expression of interest, it received a -page form from the Home Office, designed for organisations with direct experience of providing asylum accommodation in the past ten years. It was, said Susan Aitken, the council leader, “almost impossible for us to answer”.Undeterred, she is among other local authority heads pressing for greater oversight of the new AASC arrangements, albeit to little avail. The Home Office has repeatedly warned that ceding control of property inspections to local authorities, for example, would compromise its ability to hold accommodation providers to account. It is a claim as laughable as it is absurd. Such is the Home Office’s commitment to ensuring that asylum housing is fit for purpose, it employs the grand total of nine contract compliance officers, responsible for assessing , dispersal accommodationproperties across the UK. A single officer is based in Glasgow.The workload they are able to carry out has produced some damning conclusions. Between March  and January this year, for example, less than a quarter of those properties inspected were found to be compliant with the requirements of the Compass contract. Close to halfwere deemed not fit for purpose. A separate inspection report carried out earlier this year by David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that the Home Office inspection regime was essentially a system of spot checks, which were neither informed by intelligence, nor subject to follow-up inspections. The Home Office has shown itself to be unable,not unwilling, to ensure some of Scotland’s most marginalised and vulnerable people are given proper shelter. If it is allowed to steamroll through its plans for AASC with no meaningful changes, we will all be the poorer for it.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847031.1545318612!/image/image.jpg","title":"richard leonard rich are only so rich because the poor are so poor","story":"When I joined the Labour Party more than  years ago, the two biggest causes of poverty in Scotland were old age and mass unemployment, writes Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.Many things have stayed the same over those three decades. Too many of our pensioners are still denied the dignity they deserve in retirement. More than , older households are in fuel poverty this winter. Too often, years of under-investment in our NHS and social care services mean older people are staying longer in hospital than they need to, and they are simply not receiving the first-rate care we ought to be able to provide as one of the world’s wealthiest countries.At the same time, in many parts of Scotland – not least in the deindustrialised areas – unemployment is signicantly understated in the official figures. Often the real rate is twice the claimant count, and insecure work is a much bigger problem than Government ministers seem to want to admit.But some things have changed. Now, the main cause of poverty in Scotland is low pay.I have written in this newspaper before about the crisis of poverty and how we must tackle it. I make no apology for doing so again, after a Scottish Government budget that anti-poverty campaigners and charities have described as a “missed opportunity”.In that budget, Labour asked for some common-sense measures that would be a start and make a real dference to people’s daily lives.We proposed a £-a-week top-up to Child Benefit. This would immediately lt , children in Scotland out of poverty and is something that churches, charities, trade unions and academics all support. The SNP refused.: Kirk Moderator: Sturgeon must take urgent action over child povertyWe also proposed £ million injection of finance into the fund designed to help families who are struggling with their housing costs and who are, therefore, at risk of eviction and homelessness. The SNP refused.We also called for the Scottish Government to use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to protect families from the Tory Government’s cruel and inhumane two-child cap on Tax Credits and Universal Credit, and the ‘rape clause’ that a Tory MSP tried to claim this week did not exist. Doing this would cost just . per cent of the Scottish budget. The SNP, inexplicably, refused, saying they could not afford it. The question most people are asking is, can they afford not to Until we have a Government that takes these matters seriously, we will never make progress.As we look forward to Christmas, no one can be proud of the fact that , children in Scotland – one in four – are living below the poverty line. Of these, more than  per cent are growing up in households where at least one adult is in work. So we need to provide support through our social security system now. But we also need to re-establish genuine full employment as a goal of public policy. Because although we are regularly told that we have record levels of people in work, employment is now counted in the official statistics as “one hour or more of paid work per week” and includes “those doing unpaid family work”.And we need action to tackle the low-wage economy. Real earnings are still lower than before the financial crash. People are working hard but still struggling, although this is not the case for everyone of course. Wages are being depressed so that profits and idends to shareholders can continue to rise. In fact, latest estimates are that idend payments on shares this year will be up by . per cent to a record £. billion.: Richard Leonard: Labour Government would start using Holyrood powers to fight povertyThere is an old saying that the rich are only so rich because the poor are so poor. How true that is.This week, another man who had been sleeping rough died. While the hundreds of deaths of rough sleepers across the UK are rarely reported, this one made the news because he was sleeping outside the Houses of Parliament. What a symbol of how broken our political system is.We need to change it. And there are no short cuts to the change that we need to make. We need radical, transformative change. An end to the policies of punitive austerity, inflicting poverty and inequality on working people, while the wealthy just get wealthier. Last weekend I was pleased to welcome the UK Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn back to Edinburgh to meet and thank organisations who are helping families experiencing homelessness and relying on foodbanks. The kind of society Jeremy and I want, and have spent our lives campaigning for, is one where charities like these are unnecessary. Not, as now, seen as inevitable.We want a society where decent housing is an inalienable human right, not an investment opportunity for a wealthy few, and where we invest in our communities, not impose austerity. A society that offers hope over despair.In , we will mark the th anniversary of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament. I was proud to have campaigned for a parliament for change, alongside the late Donald Dewar, Jack McConnell, Maria Fyfe, and many others across the labour movement. At that time, we had ambition and hope that our parliament would be a  to make people’s lives better, to lt people out of poverty, to tackle injustice and inequality. Twenty years on, it is a signal of how much we need to recapture that spirit that we are having to talk about a budget of missed opportunities.I joined the Labour Party to change things, to fight injustice, to campaign for a democratic and socialist alternative to the Thatcherite political and economic model that was wreaking havoc on our communities and was set to go on to cause much more damage and misery. Many things have changed over those three decades, but the need for a radical, socialist, transformative Labour Party – in power in Scotland and across the UK – has not.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845818.1545206166!/image/image.jpg","title":"why birmingham may be a role model for scottish cities chris mccall","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...After three months in Birmingham, Chris McCall says the rebirth of UK#s second largest conurbation could have lessons for Scotland#s cities.Their faces said it all. It was a look of slight surprise crossed with mild concern. I had told them I was moving to Birmingham. Whether it was friends, family or colleagues, they struggled to see the appeal of le in the UK’s second largest city.I would explain I was moving for a three-month work secondment. It was too good an opportunity to turn down. I planned to travel home to Glasgow most weekends. Exploring a new city would be fun.“The only thing I know about Birmingham is there are a lot of motorways,” was a typical response. It had that in common with my home town, I thought. Here was another place that had been determined to bulldoze its way to post-war prosperity. Unlike Scotland’s biggest city, Brum held its nerve and built not one but two ring roads – instead of the half-finished mess inflicted on Charing Cross and Tradeston.But what did I really know about this sprawling metropolis  That the car was king, of course. Millions of them were built there and thousands of properties had been cleared to make way for the roads its new car-owning society demanded. Birmingham was the UK’s Motown – but with a much heavier musical legacy Black Sabbath never wrote cutesy soul songs.“Birmingham’s name is known everywhere,” the broadcaster Jonathan Meades observed two decades ago. “But its people aren’t, and nor is their city which is in the middle of England and is Middle England. It’s hyperbolically typical of England, yet at the same time it’s hermetic – it’s an ignored voice in the heart of the country.”It’s fair to say that downtown Brum is still largely dominated by its roads. Yet it’s gradually moving away from the cult of the automobile towards a more sustainable future which could offer examples for Scotland’s major cities.When I stepped off the train at New Street in September, I was determined I would understand Birmingham by the time I left. I might not grow to love it, I thought, but I would at the very least appreciate what it had to offer.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesStations can tell us a lot about a place, and the story of New Street tells us more than most. It was once a grand Victorian affair with an Italianate style hotel and a spectacular  canopy designed by Edward Alfred Cowper. It was a terminus that reflected the commercial might of the Midlands.That fine station roof was one of many Brum landmarks to be damaged beyond repair by the Luftwaffe, while the hotel fell victim to British Rail’s west coast mainline modernisation programme of the early s – the same damned project that blighted London’s Euston station. The new New Street was generally despised from the off. Instead of providing a beacon of the future, it condemned passengers to a hideous concrete bunker. A costly refurbishment programme began in . While the s remain subterranean – meaning diesel fumes still linger – the upstairs is now a bold and bright concourse.There’s plenty of space for strangers to find their bearings. “If you think it’s bad now, you should have seen it before,” Brummies say, with characteristic self-deprecation. “Brum will be great when it’s finally finished,” is another line you hear regularly. This is a city with a long record of tearing itself down and trying something dferent.The New Street rebuild is just one of several ambitious local projects. The redeveloped Bullring shopping centre boasts a Selfridges, the high-end department store long coveted by Glasgow. The city’s modern tram network is currently being extended with little of the fuss seen in Edinburgh.: Kevin Buckle: Edinburgh’s lost railway could be restoredHere I was, privileged to be witnessing the rebirth of one of the UK’s major cities in real time. Unlike in Dundee, which has chosen to take the Bilbao route of hanging its international appeal on an eye-catching museum, Birmingham has opted to get the basics right. If you can offer numerous decent shops and a gleaming station, visitors will soon follow.For a city with a long association with the car, it’s investing substantial amounts in public transport. Its suburban rail network has been continuously growing for years. Then there’s the small matter of HS, the eye-wateringly expensive infrastructure project – or colossal folly, depending on your viewpoint – which will link Birmingham with London via a new high-speed rail line.In comparison, it strikes me that Scotland’s two biggest cities seem incapable of sorting out public transport in their own backyards. Edinburgh’s buses are the best outside of London but the capital seems uninterested in reopening its extensive network of suburban railways to passengers. The less said about the tram system, the better.Glasgow, meanwhile, boasts dozens of stations yet is stuck with a bus network that’s grimly tolerated at best. Its own plans for a tram system bit the dust  years ago and have never seriously been reconsidered.Brummies would be the first to tell you their city isn’t perfect. Among other things, it lacks any instantly recognisble landmarks to entice visitors. The council hopes its flash public library, opened in , is becoming one. The -storey building positively screams modern civic ambition.I looked beyond these modern developments whenever I felt the dull ache of home sickness. I was fortunate to stay a short distance from the Birmingham and Worcester canal, one of two major waterways built in the Georgian era. If you enjoy a stroll along a quiet towpath, Birmingham is your place. It’s one of the few parts of the city you’re guaranteed not see any cars.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847227.1545338775!/image/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of scots drivers are on the road with 12 points or more new figures reveal","story":"Nearly  drivers with  points or more on their record are still behind the wheel on Scotland#s roads, official figures have revealed.One driver is still allowed to drive despite having racked up  points.There are now calls for the authorities to look into whether persistent offenders are being properly dealt with.The information was obtained by Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Mike Rumbles through a Freedom of Information request to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency .It found that, drivers in Scotland currently have points on their licence – and  of these still on the road have  or more points on their licence. The highest number of points held by a driver still on the road is .“Almost  drivers with  points or more on their record are still on Scotland’s roads,” Mr Rumbles said.“For the safety of everyone driving home for Christmas it’s important that repeat offenders and wild drivers are kept off the roads.“It’s possible that there are mitigating factors in some cases which justy these drivers hanging on to their right to drive.

A speeding offence usually means three points on a licence. Disqualication is usually for six months, but can rise to a year or even two depending on how serious the offence is.Drivers can escape a ban –even with  points –they are able to show it will result on “exceptional hardship.” This usually means the loss of the offender’s job, particularlythey have children and a family to support.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “The Road Traffic Offenders Act  is reserved but provides for someone convicted of an offence with  or more penalty points to be disqualied unless the court feels there are mitigating circumstances that justy not disqualying the convicted person.” Leading motoring group IAM Roadsmart last month called for drivers caught speeding to be allowed to attend awareness courses rather than face fines or points on their licence.

The number of EU nationals coming to work in the UK will fall by an estimated  per cent, seen as particularly acute for Scotland which needs migration to maintain the workforce and keep the population growing. The Scottish Government has already published “catastrophic” estimates about the impact of a  per cent drop, Mr Russell said.“An  per cent drop would be impossible to imagine” he told Holyrood’s Europe committee.“It would throw the economy into complete chaos.”CBI Scotland has already hit out at the prospect of “draconian” blocks on overseas workers, while the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Institute of Directors, National Farmer’s Union, Federation of Small Businesses and Universities Scotland have also hit out at the plans.Mr Russell described the scheme as “wrong morally.” “Many of us take this as a personal affront as to how the world will see us - we’re not like this,” he said.The Scottish Government is making representations to Westminster on this with an “alternative in mind.”He said: “Clearly independence is the best alternative, but we have long argued for a devolved approach to migration.“I remember having a conversation with [former UK Brexit Secretary] David Davis about this when he was in office and pointing out the great advantage of devolving migration because you can then set whatever targets you wanted in the rest of the UK.“But we could actually meet the needs of what we have by ensuring that we had the best approach to it.“It is an approach that exists in the Canadian provinces, it’s an approach that exists in parts of Australia.

From  January, it will be opened up to EU nationals who are living in the UK and who have a passport, as well as their non-EU family members with biometric residence cards.While the expansion will substantially widen the pool of people able to apply to confirm their post-Brexit immigration status, the Home Office said that the scheme would still be in a testing phase ahead of the full launch in March.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4846666.1545296391!/image/image.jpg","title":"stagecoach turns up uk focus after selling us arm","story":"Stagecoach, the Perth-based transport operator, is to target growth opportunities closer to home after sealing a deal to sell its under-pressure US business two decades after launching into the North America market.The agreement, which values the ision at . million , comes just weeks after the bus and rail giant revealed that talks were underway to off-load the North American arm.An £.m writedown in the ision had sent the group reversing into the red at the half-year stage.The sale to private equity firm Variant Equity Advisors will see the Scots group receive m and transfer net debt of .m.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies. LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead. I just hope the changes are for the better of the collective rather than for the few    #I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.# O dear dear me, it is all a wicked capitalist conspiracy.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits.

These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms.

Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745017.1545218388!/image/image.jpg","title":"double celebrations for stuffabusni toy collection","story":"Thanks to the generosity of the Northern Ireland public, thousands of children living in poverty across the province will receive presents this Christmas.For the second year in a row, Translink and U joined forces for the Stuff a Bus Toy Appeal, in aid of The Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul.

He had made arrangements with Antrim Borough Council to have their carriage kitted out with flowers and champagne, only for his plans to be put on ice due to the weather.Not one to hang around, he put together a back-up plan to ask Leanne for her hand in marriage at the Templeton Hotel in Templepatrick.Leanne, , said: “We’re five years together, we’ve one child at four and another on the way. Romance is sort of put to the side. I hadn’t a clue this was coming. Leannes four-year-old daughter Quinn was there to witness the romantic moment on Sunday“We had our gym party on Saturday night. The idea was to go up the big wheel first then go to the party and be able to tell everyone, celebrate with them and show them the ring.“Because of the weather warning, rather than wait, he went for plan B.”At the Templeton they were taken to a reserved table decorated with crystals where staff brought out drinks and a plate with ‘Marry Me ’ written on it in chocolate.Leanne said: “Then he got down on one knee and gave me the ring. It was really romantic. I was crying my eyes out. Then he told me what I could have won.”She added: “At least we got a second go at it. The big wheel will probably be the story we’ll tell peopleanyone asks how we got engaged.“Our daughter Quinn, four, was with us the second time.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Our business and domestic rate payers deserve it. “It is imperative that we invest in our town centres to make them a vibrant and attractive place to live, work, shop and do business.”, Emma Harrison, Pearl Sibanda and Lauren Graham with Anne Kerr from the British Psychology Society and Mrs L Duke .\"  , Emma Harrison, Pearl Sibanda and Lauren Graham with Anne Kerr from the British Psychology Society and Mrs L Duke .\"  Pupils investigate the ‘Power of Unorm’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8747259.1545325544!/image/image.jpg","title":"call girl defends her work","story":"And the prostitute, who is from London, just like Billie Pipers character in the new hit television series Secret Diary of a Call Girl, has argued that her business prevents men from committing rape.The Leader first broke the story of the districts sex trade in August.At that time we revealed that sex agencies based in Dublin and Dundalk were leasing houses and flats in the town where call girls spend a short time before moving on to other locations.We also reported that other prostitutes were independent from agencies and work a circuit of towns throughout Down, Armagh and Antrim.The prostitutes had advertised their services on adult porn websites and an English daily tabloid - but after our story broke this stopped temporarily.When the adverts began to reappear in some of the tabloid press The Leader tracked down one of the women who works as a prostitute in Banbridge.Pamelarevealed that she is based in London and comes to Banbridge once a month for a week at a time.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

It is due to open at Belfast’s Grand Opera House in . Although ostensibly an inappropriate topic for a musical, she said, it was requested by one of the survivors – saxophonist Des McAlea, also known as Des Lee.“Survivor Des Lee approached Martin and asked for their story to be told – from beginning to end,” Ms Jones said. “It is done sensitively, but they were five guys in a band, on the road together, so there is humour too.”Double celebrations

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christmas in comfort at clonard","story":"CLONARD parishioners will be able to enjoy their Christmas Mass even more this year as the traditional hard wooden pews have been consigned to the past. In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chris moncrieff whether youre a leaver or a remainer a second poll would be a betrayal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is true whether you are a Remainer or a Leaver. Parliament ordained the referendum and, at the same time, gave a solemn promise that they’d abide by the result..pushThe fact politicians have got themselves in such a mess trying to implement the referendum result in favour of quitting the EU cannot ever be used as an excuse for defaulting on the original undertaking.To her eternal credit, the Prime Minister refuses to bow to the clamour for a second referendum.She hit out at Tony Blair, accusing him of “insulting” the British people and the office of Prime Minister by “undermining” Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.In a pointed swipe at the Labour heavyweight, the Prime Minister said a second referendum would amount to parliament abdicating responsibility.Mrs May said: “For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision.“Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for. I remain determined to see that happen. I will not let the British people down.”The trouble is that the people who really matter — the great British electorate — are being fobbed off with contradictory stories about what is going on behind the scenes. Some are insisting that the Cabinet is involved in its own civil war about whether to have a second referendum, while others insist this is completely untrue.Meanwhile, those calling for another poll are claiming that those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did not appreciate what this would involve.How patronising. Of course, most people realised that the EU negotiating team would try to squeeze every drop of blood out of the UK in what has approached the level of bullying the Prime Minister partly, no doubt, to frighten any other member states which might be considering following in the UK’s footsteps.It’s asthe elitists simply assume — arrogantly — that they know better than the people they are supposed to serve .Some of the reasons given by those demanding another referendum are bizarre — to put it mildly. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said the Remain campaign during the original referendum fell far short of even being effective.Well, that is laughable and is no reason for going to the polls again.The simple truth is that the British voters, on both sides of the argument, deserve better of their politicians than this.n Theresa May is fighting her corner against a stubborn and obdurate team of negotiators in Brussels, who are finding her a much tougher opponent than they’d probably expected.But there are those who would like to see a little more drama and aggression on the part of the UK team.In similar circumstances, Margaret Thatcherwould thump the table and brandish her famous handbag, frightening the lives out of the Brussels team.Theresa May cannot match that — but she is adamant not to surrender and is to be commended for that.But what is urgently required is some kind of magic to sort out the shambles in the House of Commons, where at the moment getting a majority on anything appears to be a major problem.Somehow, all this has to be resolved and the Leavers get what they voted for in the referendum in a fair and honourable way. n When all this is over, major surgery will be required to restore the shattered Conservative Party back to rude health. It may well take a new leader to do that.As you might expect, the usual suspects, like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , have both indicated they will be in the running.But in politics, it is often not the obvious names who get the crown.Has anyone thought of David Lidington — the quiet man who is Theresa May’s de facto number two  He is the dark horse to watch.But there is going to be a lot more discord before that position is reached."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast to gatwick passengers told to check friday flight info ryanair reroutes all flights to stansted","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish government has made no preparations for hard border says varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Battery-only cars have no combustion engine, while plug-in hybrids can operate in full electric mode, using conventional fuel or a combination of both.

General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service!— Donald J. TrumpDecember , Mr Trump said in a tweet the defence secretary was retiring.The announcement came a day after Mr Trump surprised US allies and members of Congress by announcing the withdrawal of all troops from Syria, while he continues to consider shrinking the American deployment in Afghanistan.Mr Trump’s decision to pull troops out of Syria has been sharply criticised for abandoning America’s Kurdish allies, who may well face a Turkish assault once US troops leave, and had been staunchly opposed by the Pentagon.Mr Mattis, in his resignation letter, emphasised the importance of standing up for US allies.“While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies,” Mr Mattis wrote.Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administrationSenate intelligence committee vice-chairman Mark WarnerFacebookTwitterHis departure was quickly lamented by foreign policy hands on both sides of the aisle.Last year, Republican senator Bob Corker – a frequent critic of the president – said Mr Mattis, along with White House chief of staff John Kelly and then-secretary of state Rex Tillerson, were helping “separate our country from chaos.”Mr Tillerson was fired early this year and Mr Kelly is to leave the White House in the coming days.“This is scary,” Senate intelligence committee vice-chairman Mark Warner said on Twitter.“Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Part of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis’s resignation letter to Donald Trump Mr Mattis’s departure has long been rumoured but officials close to him had insisted the battle-hardened, retired marine would hang on.A White House official said Mr Mattis informed Mr Trump of his decision to leave the administration on Thursday afternoon.Mr Trump said a replacement would be chosen soon.At the start of the Trump administration, the president had gushed about his respect for Mr Mattis, repeatedly calling him “Mad Dog”, despite Mr Mattis’s own public insistence that the moniker was never his.Instead, his nickname for years was CHAOS, which stood for “Colonel Has An Outstanding Suggestion,” and reflected Mattis’ more cerebral nature.The two quickly clashed on major policy decisions.During his first conversations with Mr Trump about the Pentagon job, Mr Mattis made it clear he disagreed with his new boss in two areas.He said torture does not work, despite Mr Trumps assertion during the campaign that it did, and he voiced staunch support for traditional US international alliances, including Nato, which the president repeatedly criticised."},{"url":null,"title":"motorists urged vigilant pranksters target vehicles derrys bogside","story":"A Derry councillor has appealed to so called pranksters to stop targeting vehicles in

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon.

Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that.

In  he sailed from Bangor to travel across Europe for  years, founding communities and monasteries.The cities and regions across Europe where his memory live on are joining forces to create a cultural walking route of which Newry, Mourne and Down Council wants to be a part of.The St Patrickrsquos Way route mdash which links key sites associated with the saint across the district mdash could form part of the proposed new cultural route linked to Columbanus.The proposed feasibility study will examine the merits of getting involved in the ambitious project, with support from the other three local authorities.Members of the local councilrsquos Economic, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were told on Monday night that the feasibility study will also look at the marketing opportunities the new cultural walking route presents and, signicantly, the level of investment required to ensure the walking route can attract international visitors to Down and other parts of the province.Councillors were told the study will examine the amount of money required to finance what has been described as a ldquohigh quality visitor experience and what services and facilities walkers would require which are not currently available.News of the feasibility study comes just a week after Newry, Mourne and Down Council gave its support for a new campaign aimed at restoring the former Ulster Way walking route to link Killyleagh with Strangford via Downpatrick.Local politicians say they recognise the importance of this particular project and its potential for increasing the number of tourists to the area, with the proposal described as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.Politicians agreed that council officials start work on the project to help restore the Ulster Way which would reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.They say a huge investment will not be required to restore a series of off-road paths, with the route requiring the provision of several sections of boardwalk to reconnect existing paths over boggy ground.Cllr Cadogan Enright said restoring local sections of the former Ulster Way could reconnect what he described as the ldquojewels in the crown of East Down.Moving forward, he said Newry, Mourne and Down Council needed to prioritise the required work as part of a cross departmental plan ldquoto have any hope of success within a reasonable timescale..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Yuletide festivities  ","story":"ITrsquoS going to be a busy festive season for Ballynahinch sports fans.Not only are Ballynahinch Olympic involved in two major football finals inside  hours, but the townrsquos hockey club are also through to a Yuletide showpiece decider.The Olympic seconds team face Celtic Bhoys in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final at Drumaness on Boxing Day.Twenty four hours later the Olympic firsts take on Crumlin Star in the Border Cup final at Seaview.The Ballynahinch club will be hoping to emulate Drumaness Mills who won both finals in .Athletics is catered for with the Castlewellan Parkrun taking place this Saturday before Newcastle ACrsquos highly popular Christmas Cracker race in Castlewellan on Saturday, December .Just for good measure, Downrsquos senior Gaelic footballers open their McKenna Cup campaign away to Cavan on Sunday, December , and Tollymore Unitedrsquos youth teams are involved in two Lisburn Youth League cup finals.Both games will be played at the Lisburn Leisure Centre pitches and it is sure to be a great day of football for everyone involved with the club.

The European Commission has set out plans for  areas most likely to be impactedthe UK leaves the bloc without a deal, but the Irish border was notably absent from the list.Dublin has also published a -page ‘Getting Ireland Brexit Ready’ document outlining back up plans for almost  sectors.But again, crucially, the dossier made no mention of how the Republic plans to address the Irish border issue post-Brexit.The paper says the government’s main focus is to prevent the emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland, though it does not specy how that will be preventedthe prime minister’s withdrawal agreement is rejected by Parliament.DUP Westminster leader Mr Dodds said the fact that the border issue had been omitted from the plans demonstrated that, in the event of a no-deal scenario, a hard border will not come to pass.His remarks came hours before Irish Premier Leo Varadkar said that his government has made “no preparations whatsoever” for a hard border on the island.Despite the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Varadkar said he felt thathis government made plans to facilitate a hard border it would become a “self-fulfilling prophecy”.He insisted that Dublin was not preparing for a hard border nor was it planning to introduce any sort of physical infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic.And he said the best way to avoid a hard Brexit is for Parliament to implement Theresa May’s draft withdrawal deal.The threat of a hard border is the main justication for the EU’s proposed backstop, which aims to keep NI in the EU customs union after Brexit, but which unionists fear will weaken the Union.Mr Dodds said the notion that it is necessary to have checks in the Irish Sea to avoid a hard border between NI and the Irish Republic is an “utter con trick”. The North Belfast MP added that the EU’s back up plans “totally avoid spelling out” what happens on the border, adding: “What does that tell you  Even in the event of a so-called no-deal scenario a hard border won’t happen.Stephen Carson murder pair sentenced to  years Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Even the Dublin authorities in its no-deal plans admitted no checks on goods at the border. “The utter hypocrisy of those espousing the current withdrawal agreement with its trap of a backstop has been completely exposed.”Asked by the News Letter this week, the EU did not explicitly say who might be responsible for building physical infrastructure at the border. But TUV leader Jim Allister has maintained that,the EU chooses to impose the hard border, Dublin would be obliged to implement it on the ground. DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said the EU and the Irish Republic’s warnings of a hard Brexit were “mere bluffs”, adding: “They will not be putting any checkpoints at the border. “A recent mapping exercise carried out by the Irish army has discovered almost  more crossings points into NI than was previously thought, making the idea of imposing a hard border totally and utter impossible.”Offering an explanation as to why the Irish border was not addressed in his government’s contingency plans, Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said the backstop is the only solution.“For us to be giving signals that there’s any other way this could be solved would be foolish,” he told RTE.Mr Coveney added that it would not be helpful for the document to be “dominated by that border debate”.Dublin’s contingency plans identied affected sectors that would require up to between  and  pieces of new legislation.The no-deal plans include the purchase of land at ports to prevent congestion from new customs.Speaking at a media briefing, Mr Varadkar said: “The contingency plans we are making are very real but they are happening at our ports, particularly Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare, where we have acquired or are in the process of acquiring land and will develop border control posts in those places.“They may be needed in March in the event of a hard Brexit, butthey are not needed in March, they will be, or are very likely to be, needed at some point into the future.“So that is the contingency planning that we are making, but we are not making to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We simply cannot countenance that being the case.”try catch  TrendingThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas DayN.I. family devastated after heartless thieves steal family petConcern for missing N.I. man - PSNI encourage people to check outbuildingsNorthern Ireland Christmas  payment dates for Universal Credit, tax credits, disability living allowance, PIP and moreREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decades          ..

The committee welcomed the clarication for NI’s agricultural industry, but stressed that a similar commitment from the EU is now essential to ensure cross-border trade is not disrupted.Committee chairman, Dr Andrew Murrison, said it was “a step in the right direction”, but added that “further clarity” was still needed on the issues of financial support, live animal exports and the agricultural work force. He added: “Farmers and producers across Northern Ireland have been crying out for some explanation from the government of how they will be able to trade with Ireland after Brexit. “The government’s response to my committee’s report on agriculture commits to avoiding checks on agricultural products at the Irish border. “It is essential that exports of agricultural products to Ireland do not face unnecessarily stringent checks. The ball is now in the EU’s court to make a similar commitment.”Despite the clarication on trade, the committee said the government has failed to take action on its recommendations on urgent priorities for NI’s agricultural sector. While the government stressed that a Northern Ireland Executive is the only way a tailored agriculture policy for the Province can be devised, the committee warned: “They cannot continue to rely on an imminently restored Executive to address the pressing issue of preparing NI’s agri-food industry for le outside the EU. “In particular, the government must clary whether DAERA will be able to authorise a policy that will avoid additional border checks in a no-deal scenario,there is no Assembly in place to do so.”Stephen Carson murder pair sentenced to  years Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas DayN.I. family devastated after heartless thieves steal family petConcern for missing N.I. man - PSNI encourage people to check outbuildingsNorthern Ireland Christmas  payment dates for Universal Credit, tax credits, disability living allowance, PIP and moreREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decades          ..

The appalling care failings at Muckamore Abbey Hospital have again highlighted the importance of candour in health and social services. He added: “Over the next - months, there will be substantial progress against almost all of the recommendations. “The vast majority which do not require ministerial or Executive approval will be implementable in that timeframe.”‘Shocking’ winter related deaths spiral to highest rates on record Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas DayN.I. family devastated after heartless thieves steal family petConcern for missing N.I. man - PSNI encourage people to check outbuildingsNorthern Ireland Christmas  payment dates for Universal Credit, tax credits, disability living allowance, PIP and moreMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forest          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Parents in Moira, Maralin and other outlying areas would rightly be thinking whether a bus to Lurgan, then another bus to Portadown in the morning, then reverse the process in the afternoon - earlier starting and later finishing – would be conducive to their children’s well-being or learning.“The best way to meet their needs is that they remain on the Toberhewny site where teachers who know them, really know them, can offer them a first-class education.“Educators will tell you that transition at any age can bring regression for many children so why in Lurgan are we willing to let this happen “Previous Craigavon Senior High School principals often said it took at least a full term for pupils to settle down to learn. We are always teaching for readiness and when relationships are formed, the learning can begin.” They said staff at Lurgan Junior High School ‘would willingly embrace these young people and provide for them the best educational outcomes possible with a curriculum suited to their needs’.Their letter added: “The ideal solution would be for the pupils to remain on the Toberhewny site at a new - school, which would accommodate not only our - children but also those who would have gone on to Craigavon Senior High School .

Our pupils deserve to be treated equally.“Lurgan Junior High School is almost  years old so now is the time to be bullish and push for a modern, state of the art solution for all children in our catchment area.” In an appeal to parents they said: “Make every effort to attend the consultation meeting, Ask questions at the meeting, Speak up for your children – all are important whether Grammar or High School pupils.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province.

With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
