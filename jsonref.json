Chloe Goins claimed she was assaulted by Crosby at the mansion, but criminal charges in this case were ruled out. It also had a reputation of being dirty after multiple former Playboy bunnies spoke out about the dilapidated building and floors strewn with dog feces and urine.In 2011, health officials confirmed that the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u0027 disease was found in a whirlpool spa at the Playboy Mansion where more than 100 people fell ill.The Los Angeles County Health Department presented its findings at an annual conference at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The legionella bacteria also causes a milder illness called Pontiac fever.Symptoms, which include fever and headache, are the same as those suffered by the Playboy Mansion partygoers. Hefner decided not to leave the mansion to his widow Crystal after his death but chose to sell it while he was still alive - with the condition he was allowed to stay there until his death. However he did leave her $5million and a 5,900 square foot house in Beverly Hills. Most of his fortune was split between his four children and various charities.Crystal, 31, was the third of his wives, having married him in 2012.He had previously been married to Mildred Williams from 1949-1959, with whom he had two children, and Kimberley Conrad - 1989\u0027s 27-year-old Playmate of the Year - from 1989-2010.Cooper, Hefner and Conrad\u0027s elder son, said that he and brother Marston grew up with a framed photo of his mom\u0027s nude centerfold in the home.\u0027Yeah, that was weird,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027It was like the elephant in the room.\u0027Hefner also had a bevvy of \u0027girlfriends\u0027 who lived with him - usually several at a time - at his famed Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles.Despite declaring that he had slept with more than a thousand women, Hefner spent much of his life \u0027looking for love in all the wrong places,\u0027 as he tearfully told The New York Times in 1992.Hefner married Crystal - and took up a life of monogamy - in 2012 after briefly calling off the engagement. \u0027Maybe I should be single,\u0027 he said a few months later.\u0027But I do know that I need an ongoing romantic relationship. In other words, I am essentially a very romantic person, and all I really was looking for, quite frankly, with the notion of marriage was continuity and something to let the girl know that I really cared.\u0027The year before their marriage, he had mused: \u0027I never really found my soulmate.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Judge rules SUSPEND Britney Spears father Jamie conservator big win pop star","story":"   Rosengart further told the paper that the allegations made by Vlasov warranted urgent inquiry.He said it was yet further evidence of the mistreatment of the singer, who on June 23 told the court she was forced to have birth control implants was forbidden from driving her car and had no say in her most basic life decisions. \u0027Placing a listening device in Britney\u0027s bedroom would be particularly inexcusable and disgraceful, and corroborates so much of her compelling, poignant testimony.\u0027These actions must be fully and aggressively investigated.\u0027He said in Monday\u0027s court documents that he intends to depose the 69-year-old, and that if he plead the Fifth Amendment it would be damning. It is unclear whether the court which managed the conservatorship had approved the recordings.Britney has not commented on the specific allegations that she was secretly recorded, but in an Instagram post on Monday said that the documentary, Controlling Britney Spears, had many factual errors.\u0027I watched a little bit of the last documentary and I hate to inform you but a lot of what you heard is not true!!!\u0027 she said. "},{"url":null,"title":"Cristiano Ronaldos driver gives queueing SEVEN hours petrol stars 220k Bentley","story":"Share this articleCristiano Ronaldo\u0027s driver waited seven hours to fill up £220k Bentley - but left without a drop"},{"url":null,"title":"North Yorkshire drink driver sentenced sleeping van friend lay dying","story":"Share this article Mick Roffe, head of roads policing, said: \u0027The consequences of Bennett\u0027s actions cannot be underestimated. His decision to get behind the wheel of his van and drive that night resulted in the tragic loss of Simon Maving\u0027s life, the impact of which will be felt by Simon\u0027s family and friends forever.\u0027I hope Bennett\u0027s sentence sends a strong and clear message to anyone thinking about getting behind the wheel after drinking.

The report also warned that Russia and China were attempting to exploit that inequality to “undermine the West and expand their influence by donating and selling vaccines”, the Press Association reports. They are expected to be available from clinics set up in a special economic zone, under a healthcare ministry proposal, Russian Kommersant daily reported on Thursday. Many Western nations have not registered Russian vaccines such as Sputnik V and require visitors to have other shots that are not available to Russians, a situation that has prompted vaccine tourism, Reuters reports. According to the Kommersant report, the healthcare ministry has proposed allowing clinics set up in the Moscow International Medical Cluster to import vaccines made abroad, such as the PfizerBioNTech, or Moderna shots. It was unclear whether and when the proposed regulations could be enacted.Hospital CEO Dan Winkelman urged “every resident of the Yukon-Kuskokwim region to get vaccinated, wear a mask in indoor public areas, and social distance.” He warned that “this is our last stand against this virus.”The vaccine is voluntary and free of charge in Denmark, which on 10 September declared that it no longer considers Covid as “a socially critical disease” because of the large number of vaccinations.  All restrictions have since been removed.It came as the country registered 194 new coronavirus-related deaths. The number of new cases has been growing over the past several weeks and the government has already tightened lockdown restrictions, Reuters reports. Ukraine lifted lockdown restrictions as cases dropped over the summer but last week imposed a nationwide “yellow” code, which curbs mass events and limits the occupancy rates of gyms, cinemas and other venues.People will be able to leave their homes, restaurants can serve take-away meals and other essential businesses can reopen, the city said on its website Thursday. However, social distancing will remain, while schools are closed, public transport continues to be suspended, travel in and out of the city will be controlled and public gatherings of more than 10 people outside is banned. People who wish to attend social activities will have to show proof of vaccination to be admitted to establishments, authorities said. Ho Chi Minh City along with 18 southern provinces went into lockdown in mid-July when cases started to surge. In the past three months, the delta variant of the virus has infected 770,000 people and killed over 19,000, according to the health ministry. Most of Vietnam’s Covid deaths occurred in this wave, with Ho Chi Minh City accounting for the majority of them.In a statement, the Public Service Department said vaccinations would be made compulsory for federal staff in order to boost public confidence and ensure government services can be delivered smoothly. Unvaccinated employees have been given until 1 November to complete their inoculations, while those who are unable to be vaccinated must submit health information verified by a government medical officer. Those who fail to get vaccinated in time will face disciplinary action, the department said.In evidence to the Senate’s Covid committee on Thursday, the chief executive of Services Australia, Rebecca Skinner, said the department had developed a visible digital seal for vaccine status that would be ready by the end of October. She said: The so-called visible digital seal (VDS) project will allow Australians to verify their vaccination status with Home Affairs, who will create a “highly authenticated” digital record for travel and for use by third parties, such as airlines and other countries.It brings its overall death toll up to 448,062 since the pandemic began last year. It also registered some 23,529 new infections within the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 33.74 million. It came just one night after the production joined the return of Broadway’s biggest musicals from a pandemic-induced hiatus, reports Reuters. In a notice posted on Twitter shortly before the curtain was due to go up, producers said testing protocols had detected an unspecified number of “breakthrough” infections among vaccinated members of the Aladdin company at The New York Amsterdam Theatre. “Because the wellness and safety of our guests, cast, and crew are our top priority, tonight’s performance, Wednesday, September 29th, is canceled,” the tweet said, adding that tickets would be refunded at their points of purchase. It said the status of future performances of Aladdin, based on Disney’s 1992 animated hit film, would be announced on Thursday.Hunt said expanding vaccine choice from AstraZeneca to include the mRNA vaccines could help more than 300,000 older people who have been waiting to get vaccinated. From 1 October all people aged 12 and over will be able to get Moderna from a pharmacist and Pfizer from a GP. The announcement follows moves earlier in September by Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia to offer Pfizer to older residents as Australia’s shortage of it eased. On Thursday New South Wales opened eligibility for Pfizer and Moderna to those aged 60 and over. We start with the news that people who experienced depression or anxiety before the Covid pandemic were more likely to lose their jobs and suffer delays to medical treatment at the height of the crisis. The UK Research and Innovation-funded Covid-19 Longitudinal Health and Wellbeing National Core Study is looking at the health, social and economic impacts of the pandemic. The new analysis, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, looked at data from 59,482 people who are surveyed regularly as part of ongoing studies. Dr Praveetha Patalay, senior author on the paper from University College London (UCL), said:  With signs of activity slowing even before pressures on supply chains began to mount over the past few weeks, the chancellor was criticised for cutting off a wage-subsidy lifeline that is still supporting well over a million jobs. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the end of the furlough scheme coupled with the £20 a week cut in universal credit next week meant the government was heading into the winter with no plan to protect workers. “Ministers should rethink the end of furlough. Many workers in hard hit industries are still furloughed and need support for longer. Otherwise, we may see a rise in unemployment,” O’Grady said. Business leaders warned of an “autumn storm” from the government dismantling emergency pandemic support schemes at a time when the economic recovery from Covid-19 was faltering.  Larry Elliott and Richard Partington report:  Premier Daniel Andrews said he was sure the latest case numbers would be “of great concern to all Victorians”. “The Thursday after a long weekend, and particularly given what we know from interviews over recent days, many of these cases were completely avoidable,” he said: Food banks, which hand out staple goods from dried pasta to baby food, are especially concerned about the loss of the top-up to the Universal Credit (UC) benefit, which is claimed by almost 6 million people, according to official statistics.The British move comes as other countries start wrapping up state aid programmes announced last year as Covid battered the global economy. In the United States, pandemic unemployment benefits that supported millions of jobless, gig workers and business owners came to an end in early September, a month after a moratorium on residential evictions expired.Australia and Canada have also announced plans to end income subsidies in the near future.A British government spokesperson said the income benefit increase was always intended to be temporary and had been effective in softening the pandemic’s impact on family finances, adding that the focus now was on helping people back to work.Nationwide, more than 800,000 people will be pushed into poverty by the benefit cut, according to British think-tank the Legatum Institute.A fifth of the benefit’s claimants said they would “very likely” need to skip meals once the uplift is withdrawn, found a survey of more than 2,000 people carried out for the Trussell Trust.A similar number said they would struggle to afford to heat their homes.Britain’s charity food banks are “preparing for the worst”, Reuters reports, as the government starts winding up emergency aid measures put in place to cushion the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on millions of workers and low-income households. Meanwhile in Australia, the Victorian state of Melbourne has reported its highest one-day case total of the pandemic so far, as its Delta outbreak overtakes infections in the neighbouring state of New South Wales.  More on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments:  "},{"url":null,"title":"i m embarrassed teachers react to unions call to be part of covid bonus talks","story":"Many teachers have taken to social media to say they are not seeking Covid bonus payments. Photograph: iStockWhen teachers’ unions announced they were joining the queue of frontline professionals seeking access to talks over Covid-19 bonuses, they expected a backlash – just not from their own members.“Who asked our union to look for a bonus pandemic payment? How many emails and texts? I haven’t heard even one member,” said one teacher. “What on earth is going on here?”Another local teachers’ union representative said: “I’d be embarrassed to put ourselves in the same category as health professionals . . . No way should we be seeking to get the same reward.”School principals, too, said it was not a matter of discussion or debate in staffrooms.“As a school principal and member of one of these unions, I have not heard a single solitary teacher or school leader colleague even suggest this? Seldom things really irritate me, but this takes the biscuit!” one said.The response shows how a well-meaning Government initiative – to recognise the contribution of frontline workers during the pandemic – risks snowballing into a unseemly free-for-all between civil servants, public sector workers, teachers and retail workers.Growing alarmThe potential for ballooning costs is also a source of growing alarm. The Government estimates that the cost of giving extra leave days across the health sector would be about €377 million, or €1 billion if applied across the public sector.Teachers’ unions were keen to point out that they were not “demanding” bonus payments and have not lodged any claims. Rather, if there are discussions around rewarding workers, they feel they should be at the table. They add that they were simply responding to smoke signals from the Government that the bonus could apply outside the health sector.“Leo Varadkar said last week that it shouldn’t be limited to health workers,” said one union source. “He highlighted the work of civil servants making sure people got pandemic unemployment payments. So, if that’s what we’re talking about, then, yes, we should be at the table.”The debate cuts across another contentious question: what exactly is a “frontline” worker?For many it’s a health professional who had to don personal protective equipment for others, it includes retail workers who kept shelves stacked during the darkest days of the pandemic. Teachers’ unions feel their members are also legitimate frontline workers.“They’re working in crowded classrooms and making huge efforts to keep schools open . . . it’s only right that they should be considered,” said one.The fact that schools closed for a considerable time, however, has fuelled outrage among some that taxpayers could end up footing the bill for teachers’ bonuses or bank holidays.GrievanceThe sense of grievance is especially strong among parents of special needs pupils, who feel let down that special schools closed at a time when they remained open across Europe.“Their refusal to reopen the schools in early 2021 was highly damaging to vulnerable pupils,” one campaigner said. “I think there would be outrage if the Government gives in to these demands.”At Government level, there is now growing awareness that the idea of Covid bonuses is mushrooming into an isive issue. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar acknowledged as much when he spoke to reporters this week.“It’s not just people who were working in the public sector, it’s also people who are volunteering as well . . . It is difficult, but we want to get it right.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Earlier leaf-fall, even of days, could reduce carbon stored by forestsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021.

Photograph: Valerie O’SullivanKay Collins has swapped an office and the books of her family’s haulage business for a lorry cab and the open road for a few days every week. It is not out of choice but necessity.The 32-year-old accountant has had to stand in as a lorry driver at Collins Transport – a fourth-generation family business in north Co Cork – because they cannot recruit drivers.A shortage of 3,000-4,000 lorry drivers has put haulage firms under pressure to keep trucks on the road amid severe disruptions to the global supply chain as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, exacerbated in western Europe by new post-Brexit border requirements.“Growing up and having knowledge of the business, you never would have thought it would come to this,” says Collins, who now drives trucks to Cork, Dublin, Sligo and Belfast.“The shortage of drivers is kind of scary at the moment. Where is it going to end? Is it going to stop at shortages on the shelves?”She is not the only one in the family who finds themselves back behind the wheel part time. Her father and uncle, both managers, are back driving again, as is her brother, a lorry mechanic.The problem of an industry of ageing drivers has long been flagged: a future skills report as far back as 2015 forecast a demand for just under 7,000 HGV drivers to last year. A follow-up report, in 2018, addressing skills shortages linked to Brexit, said this statistic was “a cause for concern, requiring urgent attention”.The pinch is being felt now because many eastern European drivers have not returned from extended summer holidays, having found alternative work in Poland’s soaring economy.“It is very bad at the moment,” says Kay’s father, Michael. “We would normally have drivers on file that would be looking for a job but we haven’t had that for the last 12 months.”His concerns for the business have changed in the past year but he says he is fortunate to have a brother, daughter and son to call upon to make sure customer orders are fulfilled.“Before you were always worried about whether you had enough work. Now you are worried about whether you have enough drivers to take on the work,” he says.“In the haulage business, the phone is always ringing to bring an extra load here and there but we just cannot take it on because we don’t have the drivers to do it. All of these things have a knock-on effect on the economy. Lorry drivers are the backbone of the economy.”‘National emergency’Eugene Drennan, the president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, has put the crisis in his industry in stark terms, saying the Government needs to treat the shortage as “an imminent national emergency” or else face similar supply chain shortages as those in the UK, where a dearth of 100,000 drivers has left some supermarket shelves empty.“It is a very severe crisis that has been many years in the making, but the recent disasters and supply chain shocks with Brexit and the blockage in the Suez Canal are why we are hearing about it now,” says Nikolaos Valantasis Kanellos, lecturer in logistics at Technological University Dublin.The supply chain management analyst says the shortage of drivers in Ireland may seem minor compared with the UK, but the State’s reliance on road transportation, which accounts for 99 per cent of goods distributed, makes the problem equally challenging.In Britain there have been shortages of goods, from milkshakes to building materials. Oil company BP temporarily closed some forecourts because the lack of drivers prevented fuel being transported from refineries. Ireland has not yet suffered the same widespread supply shortages.“The industry is challenged with not having enough drivers but they are making the best of what they can do,” says Aidan Flynn, general manager of the Freight Transport Association Ireland.Lorry driving has become an unattractive job for a variety of reasons: poor pay and career prospects, long hours on the road, unfavourable conditions, tight and stressful delivery windows, and high insurance premiums for young drivers, who see better work options elsewhere.Ageing workersSince Brexit, border checks and red tape have added to the woes of the driver on the UK “land bridge”, whereas avoiding it means long ferry journeys on the direct routes to Europe. With few young drivers entering the industry, the average age has remained stubbornly high, in the 50s.“No new blood came in, and the old blood have retired,” says John Nolan of Nolan Transport, one of the largest haulage companies in the country, and secretary of the IRHA.Nolan says at one stage the company was “down 100 drivers” out of a full complement of 450. He sees the shortages continuing for the next two to three years and costs in his business rising as a result. Nolan is having to hike pay by 20 per cent to retain his drivers.“If I don’t do that with my drivers, a rival is going to poach them,” he says.Paddy Neary (65), from Co Louth, has been driving lorries for many years but is considering leaving the industry next year because of how difficult life on the road has become.“It is not the same job. Everyone is driving to the clock, so you don’t meet people like you used to,” he says, speaking by phone from Naples during a 10-day return trip to Europe where he has dropped a load of Irish beef and is awaiting instructions for his return load.“In Ireland most young people are highly educated and just don’t want to do it. Before Brexit, you hopped on a ferry and drove through the UK. Now you go out on direct boats that take much longer –\u0026nbsp26, 27 hours is normal. Many young men have given up. They just couldn’t be bothered.”Apprenticeship driveTo make entry into the business easier and more appealing to younger drivers, apprenticeship courses have been set up. From January, Sligo Institute of Technology in association with the FTAI will offer two-year commercial apprenticeships in logistics and supply chain management, where the apprentice driver will work and have their driving lessons and tests publicly funded.“We are trying to attract younger people and more women into the industry and improve the image of the industry as a valid choice that offers career opportunities,” says Flynn.As a more immediate solution, the industry wants the Government to permit a derogation on the driver certificate of professional competence to allow drivers who have retired or left the industry to “get back behind the wheel” and not have to wait until they qualify to drive again.Kay Collins says it is a pity that more young drivers and female drivers are not given an opportunity to get into the business. She sees driving as a “great thing” for those who want to travel but concedes that the long, uncertain hours can be a turn-off for young people.“Unless you really love it, people aren’t attracted to it,” she says.She believes that not being able to find more drivers will have damaging knock-on effects.“The driver shortage will probably end up with a haulier shortage. It is a low-margin business, and wages have increased because of the driver shortage and because of the demand,” she says. “It is squeezing us even more.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mica campaign group says 350 000 redress cap is unacceptable","story":"A protest will be held outside Leinster House on Thursday demanding 100 percent redress for homeowners affected by mica. File photograph: Tom HonanA suggested cap of €350,000 for compensation for homeowners affected by mica would not be acceptable as it would not fully cover 40 percent of homeowners, according to the mica redress campaign.“We cannot leave people behind, there should be no one left behind,” said spokesman Michael Doherty. He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that no figure for a cap was mentioned during a meeting with Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and officials from his department yesterday.“I’m very concerned at this kite-flying,” he said.Various numbers for a cap were being “floated” he said, from €350,000 to €500,000. “This is the usual form, stuff being leaked through to see where it goes. We won’t accept €350,000 as it leaves 40 percent behind.”Taoiseach Micheál Martin has pledged a “massive programme” of public spending to pay for the rebuilding and restoration of homes affected by mica damage, but officials remain opposed to a scheme that grants 100 per cent redress for every house affected, as campaigners have sought.A final decision on a new scheme will not be made until proposals are brought to Government, expected in two to three weeks.Mr O’Brien met the mica steering group on Wednesday night, but differences remain within the group between representatives of the householders and department officials.Mr O’Brien said he would publish the report of the group on Thursday, though the views of the officials and the campaigners are unlikely to be reconciled, and it is expected the report will reflect both positions.Mr Doherty pointed out that owners already faced €40,000 in costs required for testing and planning permissions as well as rental accommodation. The figures the homeowners were basing their claims on were those used by insurance companies and were for “basic finishes” for the homes affected.A protest will be held outside Leinster House on Thursday demanding 100 percent redress. “The fault lies with the lack of regulations and the lack of enforcement of regulations by the State at that time,” he added."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord electrical sparks fly in face of darkness descending","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Nick Leeder, head of Google Ireland:  “I find it extraordinary that you are prepared to leave households in the dark so that you could roll out the red carpet for data centres,” said Mary Lou McDonald.  Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Keep her lit, Micheál!This was the unanimous message from Dáil Éireann. But to be totally clear here, it’s merely a figure of speech and not intended in any way to insult or diminish Mary Lou McDonald because she is a woman. (Even if the sight of Micheál Martin ignites flames of scorching contempt in the Sinn Féin leader and the Taoiseach increasingly looks on the verge of spontaneous combustion.) Between a “generation gap” threatening electricity blackouts around the country and a gender war flaring up in the chamber, the sparks were flying between Micheál and Mary Lou on Wednesday. Business as usual, in other words. Leaders Questions kicked off with the standard pleasantries which accompany all exchanges between the two on housing policy. The routine is well-established now: the Sinn Féin leader excoriates the Government for its scandalous dereliction of duty on the housing front, the Taoiseach for his failure to understand the gravity of the crisis because he is living in a fantasy world and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for lining the pockets of wealthy developers to the detriment of ordinary people who have been given a slap in the face yet again by the Coalition’s cosy boys’ club. Rome wasn’t built in a day, argues Micheál. But you’ve been going on about it for years with no appreciable results, reposts Mary Lou. “Blathering” is what she called it on Wednesday. Then the Taoiseach lists, in great detail, all the work being done across all Government departments to speed up the implementation of the biggest house-building programme in the history of the State. He lays out the facts and figures. “Eclipsing even the programmes of de Valera,” he said on Tuesday. “Spoofing” was the word on Wednesday. Acrid exchangesThese acrid exchanges are becoming increasingly acrimonious. The Sinn Féin leader complains she cannot get the Taoiseach to respond to her crunching questions about why his coalition is failing miserably to solve the housing crisis. He hits back by accusing her party of consistently “exploiting” the crisis for base electoral gain and reels off all the vitally needed housing schemes voted down by her colleagues at local level.Mary Lou turned to the Ceann Comhairle for help during this latest bust-up because she felt Micheál wasn’t giving her straight answers. Is it not the case during this set-piece session that questions are put and the Taoiseach “attempts” to answer them “to the best of his ability”?She tacked on a condescending “however limited that may be”.Seán Ó Fearghaíl kept his nose out of the spat and said he was not having a debate on the matter. But Mary Lou argued on, ignoring his pleas to sit down. The head of Government shouldn’t be indulging in ersionary tactics, she complained. “Please Deputy, you’re bringing the House into disrepute!” cried the Ceann Comhairle.“Ooooh!” went the ample ranks of Sinn Féin TDs around her, outraged at such a suggestion. “What brings this house into disrepute is that kind of blather that we have had to listen to,” retorted their leader, giving way.You see, nobody wants power outrages. (Except, maybe, Sinn Féin. It makes for good video clips, if not constructive opposition.) The same old, same old bickering and bad blood every day now between Taoiseach and the leader of Sinn Féin is getting extremely tiresome. There’s a pair of them in it – Micheál’s increasingly ratty reactions only seem to spur on Mary Lou. Labour leader Alan Kelly brought up the really worrying subject of electrical power “outrages” (as opposed to two politicians blowing fuses on a daily basis) and asked the Taoiseach to assure the public “that the lights will stay on this winter”. He was assured “everything that needs to be done will be done”. Energy guzzlersMaybe if the energy-guzzling, power-hungry data centres around the country were capped, the prospect of households facing possible electricity cuts in months to come would diminish, suggested the Social Democrats, calling for a pause in the rapid expansion of these data farms in a Dáil motion on Wednesday morning. People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith said the problems we are having with energy supply are bound up with the Government’s commitment to building these facilities for global tech giants, which are seriously eating into Ireland’s climate targets. What’s it to be, she asked, “climate targets and data centres or climate target and heat?” It’s not that simple, replied Micheál. Banning them would not be a “measured” response, not least because of the thousands of people employed by the tech companies. “Ireland has a great reputation of serving the interests of FDIs.” “I find it extraordinary that you are prepared to leave households in the dark so that you could roll out the red carpet for data centres,” she told the Taoiseach, adding his government isn’t up to the basic task of “keeping the lights on” while people worry about rocketing energy costs and the threat of power cuts this winter. She joined in the calls for a moratorium on new data centres. Micheál got stuck in again, all riled up once again by his Sinn Féin tormentor.If she thought the topic of energy cuts was that serious, why didn’t she bring it up during Leaders’ Questions? Labour leader Alan Kelly, “in fairness, understands the seriousness of the issue”, he condescended to her.“Oh, so, I see!” Mary Lou sarcastically drawled, as if the Taoiseach had put her right on the facts.“That is the reality, now Deputy,” he informed her.“Thank you,” she replied sweetly, really hamming it up as her colleagues indignantly howled on her behalf. ‘Mere woman’“I thank the Taoiseach for mansplaining the importance of a public policy issue to a mere woman like myself,” she sneered. “You’re very good, Micheál. Go raibh maith agat.”He should have said no more after that, but he kept going. “You didn’t see it as a priority issue today. That’s your decision, that’s your option and I fully respect that . . .”(Mary Lou majored on housing, something he says is the biggest challenge facing the country today.)He talked about the budget and protections “in terms of the costs and rising costs of energy”. “I am really concentrating to understand your answer. I hope I can. I am really trying,” purred the Sinn Féin leader, derision dripping from every word. “It’s not an issue of rolling out red carpets to anybody,” said Micheál.“Is it not?” mocked Mary Lou. “Okay. If you say so.”As for rolling out the red carpet, “that’s just classic sloganeering, the hallmark of your approach to every issue”, countered Micheál. TDs were roaring on both sides of the floor. “Political insults seem to be your preferred mode” came right back at him. But mansplaining? Really, Mary Lou? This, coming from a leader who made a point of repeatedly and disparagingly referring to the Minister for Housing as “the Taoiseach’s man” and “your man” on Tuesday. A cheap shot. "},{"url":null,"title":"pandemic bonus unlikely to involve vouchers as budget day looms","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin: The issue of a bonus was “very challenging” due to the many groups seeking recognition for their work during the pandemic. Concerns in Government look set to rule out a voucher forming part of a Covid-19 pandemic bonus for frontline workers, with deepening doubts over whether a scheme can be approved by budget day.Several senior Coalition sources poured cold water over the voucher idea on Wednesday, with one saying that while it could ultimately come back on to the pitch, for now it was a “non-starter”. The logistics of rolling out such a scheme would cause issues, including the fact that it would have to be tendered for, given tens of millions of euro in exchequer funding would be involved. There would also be issues around what would be done with any remaining unspent balance on the vouchers, sources said, with this often running to 4 to 5 per cent of the total received. On a purchase that amounted to many tens of millions of euro, the source said, the leftover sums could be significant. It is hoped that any bonus would be funded from the current year’s expenditure, but there is growing scepticism in the Government over whether the scheme will be agreed ahead of the budget on October 12th. Sources said the chances of the matter being finalised within two weeks, while not totally ruled out, were receding. There is, however, a desire to bring some degree of clarity to the process before the end of the week. ‘Due recognition’The Taoiseach on Wednesday said the issue of a bonus was “very challenging” due to the many groups seeking recognition for their work during the pandemic. “It is very challenging and we will consult with social partners in this regard, in arriving at a situation that will be fair and give due recognition to an extraordinary effort all round in dealing with a once-off event,” he said. The Department of Enterprise is understood to be examining a proposal for an extra bank holiday to mark the contributions and sacrifices of people during the pandemic. Sources indicated it would probably need primary legislation, but drafting it would be regarded as complex. There would need to be a reasonable run-in time to allow employers to organise rosters. While there would also be a cost to the public service in premium pay and to the private sector in lost productivity, some of this would be clawed back through increased spending on tourism and hospitality. There are concerns in the Coalition over the nature and scope of the bonus scheme, especially if it were to focus on cash or a cash-equivalent. Stimulus not neededOne source said that “the last thing we need is stimulus, everyone is spending money. Things that encourage consumer spending are not going to be deployed.”There are also growing concerns over how isive a scheme could be, with the potential for bitter recriminations over which workers were classified as being on the “frontline”. “There is a risk, clear and present, of spending a giant amount of money and leaving people more unhappy than were before you tried it,” a Government source said. The matter of the pandemic bonus was raised at a meeting between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. It is understood that no agreement on how best to proceed was struck.Mr Donohoe told reporters that the pandemic bonus must be fair and should also recognise the contribution that many have made.“But it is also one that does need to be affordable,” he said. “The best way to move this forward now is an engagement we will have with stakeholders who are directly affected by it.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Inside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"ignore greta britain should proud industrial revolution","story":"Is there nothing in British history that cannot be co-opted and used against us? Woke historians get a kick out of trashing our imperial legacy. SNP publicists rewrite the history of the Union. And now, green warriors, led by Greta Thunberg, want us to regard Britain’s part in the industrial revolution as a source of shame, an original sin for which we must all repent. Even Michael Gove has previously talked of us having a “moral responsibility” to lead on climate change.Yet making Britain a villain for the crime of kick-starting a period of rapid technological advancement which laid the foundations of the modern world as we know it could hardly be more short-sighted. In the narrowest sense, perhaps, one might say the industrial revolution was “bad for the planet”: it was built on burning fossil fuels, after all, which is far from perfect. But, in a much broader sense, the industrial revolution is something about which Britain should be inordinately proud. It lifted our country – and eventually much of the world – out of poverty, saving billions from a life that was miserable, brutish and short.Without the many changes of the 18th and 19th centuries, driven largely by industrialisation, Britain would have been a struggling country able to support its growing population only by sending even more abroad as migrants. Instead, the 18th and 19th centuries brought unprecedented economic growth, and, in turn, prosperity and liberty.Take Bradford, for example. In the early 19th century, it became the global centre of worsted production and exchange, with factory horsepower in the city rising 718 per cent between 1810 and 1830. By 1850, the work formerly done by thousands of handloom weavers working in the countryside was performed by 17,642 automatic looms. These textile factories not only created more ersified wealth (which was previously tied to the ownership of land) but also liberated countless rural workers from what was effectively agrarian serfdom.Of course, industrial prosperity was not equally distributed by our standards, social circumstances in the mid 19th century remained inadequate and change was slow. But ultimately, it was the prosperity engendered by the industrial revolution which gave our ancestors the time and the space for politics, allowing them to start planning for a better world.As for the offending fossil fuels, the bald truth is that without them, countless modern industries would simply have sunk without trace. In the late 18th century, for example, a newspaper would be considered successful if it sold around 10,000 copies a week. Yet thanks to the advent of steam-printing (powered mostly by coal), by 1888, The Daily  had a daily circulation of 300,000.I’m sure there are plenty on the Left who would view the demise of The Daily  as a fair price to pay for a green utopia, but they should remember that it was the invention of the modern printing press which made mass education possible.If we were a few Hobbits in the Shire we might be able to turn back the clock. But the wherewithal of a modern society, its ability to feed, clothe, warm itself, and to provide defence, education, health and culture all rest on the legacy of industrialisation. We are in debt to those who came before, and forget that at our peril.Jeremy Black’s book ‘England in the Age of Dickens’ is published on October 15More from NewsGerman court issues arrest warrant for 96-year-old Nazi death camp \u0026#39fugitive\u0026#39North Korea offers to revive military hotline with the South and issues warningPolitics latest news: Furlough ends as Rishi Sunak unveils new grant scheme to fund cost of livingDemo turns violent as Taliban fires shots to break up womens\u0026#39 protestNicolas Sarkozy found guilty of illegally financing 2012 re-election bidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"modern politics has left starmer behind","story":"It was clear as soon as the opening video soundtrack beeped through the conference like a 1990s bank advert that Sir Keir Starmer had botched his chance. The leader’s conference speech was his big shot to reassure the nation that, after years of Remainer outrage and far-Left dogmatism, Labour is back. The country craves an Opposition that is emotionally in touch with the public and capable of responding to the strange times we are living through.Brexit and Covid have, in their different ways, propelled Britain into a new era. The Blairite years – which promised the end of ideology and ision, as Third Way centrism triumphed and everyone became middle-class – have given way to more fractious and unpredictable times.It was surreal then to see Keir Starmer parsing the last holder of his office to win an election as if nothing had changed since 1997, betraying none of the political instinct that made Blair such a success and which Boris Johnson so wishes he could emulate. Burning with lawyerly righteousness, Sir Keir vowed to be tough on crime. With a toothy grin he made a quip about education adopting a corporate frown, he pledged to make restoring Labour’s fiscal credibility his big priority.Perhaps Starmer couldn’t help but tip into a time warp, as he desperately edged away from sticky issues of the present. A credible leader would have detailed how a centre-Left government might manage endemic Covid without further trashing the economy. How it could put its Remainer past behind it, and in fact make more of Brexit than the disappointing incumbents.Seizing the moment, it would have also addressed the country’s suspicions about Whitehall’s mishandling of the net zero project. More broadly, it would have recognised that Labour’s big task is not to prove it can be trusted with the money (it is now clear that the Tories can’t either). It is to prove that it is in touch with ordinary people.Instead, unable to escape the weight of his own political baggage, Starmer appears to be incapable of speaking to the nation or articulating even the most basic story about today’s challenges.Having championed ruinous lockdowns and criticised the failure to enforce them earlier, Starmer was bizarrely compelled in his speech to skirt around, rather than hone in on, the state of the economy in the wake of the pandemic. Moreover, perhaps because his party faded into irrelevance during the pandemic, he seemed delusionally eager to frame Covid as an event from which we can now all move on to build a caring, socialist utopia. It would be more accurate to see the Covid years as an era that the country is still living through – somehow adapting to chronic risk, and rebuilding an economy hammered by lockdowns.Even more out of touch were Starmer’s passing references to Brexit. He talked mournfully about Britain dealing with its “aftermath” as if it were a tragedy comparable with Covid. His witterings about a “smart” government that “enlists the brilliance of scientific invention” made no mention of how, free from the EU, we can overhaul our intellectual property rules and free the robotics and genomics sectors from Brussels’ rules.It was, however, Starmer’s frenzied package of green policies that made him seem most disconnected from the public mood. Petrol queues and rising energy bills have spooked voters. Alarm is spreading through the country that No 10’s net zero mission could run down energy reserves and cause household bills to rise exorbitantly. The Opposition leader made no mention of this, instead vowing to go harder, with a Green New Deal, retrofitting for every home and bumper investment in the deep-sea wind sector. The grassroots will have liked it, although it will have done little to assuage the anger stoked up by his New Labour routine.Starmer is no doubt more than happy to be seen picking a fight with the Left, but his insipid leadership makes victory far from certain, and this lacklustre speech came just at the time rivals Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham are said to be plotting leadership challenges. His evasive, outdated politics has left him looking less than ever like PM material – something that will play on the minds of his colleagues in the PLP.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Furlough ends as Rishi Sunak unveils new grant scheme to fund cost of livingGerman court issues arrest warrant for 96-year-old Nazi death camp \u0026#39fugitive\u0026#39North Korea offers to revive military hotline with the South and issues warningDemo turns violent as Taliban fires shots to break up womens\u0026#39 protestNicolas Sarkozy found guilty of illegally financing 2012 re-election bidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"menopause hormone replacement therapy does not raise dementia","story":"Taking hormone replacement therapy during the menopause does not increase the risk of dementia, a major study suggests.However, staying on such treatments long-term was found to be linked to a slight increase in Alzheimer’s, according to the Oxford University research, published in the BMJ.Evidence about links between HRT and conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease has been conflicting. Some studies have suggested it could have a protective effect, while others have suggested it raises the risks.The new study by the Universities of Oxford, Southampton and Nottingham published in BMJ is one of the largest, involving more than 600,000 women. It found that being on HRT for up to five years did not increase the risk of dementia.Researchers said women should find the results reassuring, providing more clarity about the risks.However, the study found that staying on oestrogen-progesterone therapy for five to nine years increased the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by 11 per cent, while staying on it for more than a decade increased the risk by 19 per cent.Another less common type of HRT was associated with a lower risk of dementia.Oestrogen-only therapy was linked to 15 per cent decreased odds of dementia overall among women younger than 80 who received treatment for at least a decade, with a 1.1 per cent decrease in risk for each year of treatment.Every year, around 1.5 million women experience troubling post-menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, night sweats, sleep problems and emotional problems. Of those, around 150,000 are prescribed HRT, in the form of tablets, gels, creams or patches.The medication works by boosting levels of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which are lower among women during the menopausal period.Many women use the therapy for less than five years, with long-term use linked to breast and womb cancer, but medical guidelines do not set out any minimum or maximum period of use.Around one in 10 women aged 80 and over will develop dementia.Researchers compared 118,501 women aged 55 and older diagnosed with dementia between 1998 and 2020 with 497,416 women of the same age without the condition.In each of the groups, 14 per cent of women used HRT for more than three years.This large observational study found no overall association between use of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of developing dementia, the authors concluded.In a linked opinion piece, Prof Pauline Maki, from the University of Illinois, and Prof JoAnn Manson, from Harvard Medical School, said the study should provide reassurance for women prescribed the drug for vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats.They said hormone therapy should not be prescribed in order to prevent dementia.Dr Sara Imarisio, from Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the increased risks found for those taking HRT for five years or more was “small”, the equivalent of up to seven extra dementia cases per 10,000 person years.“Hormone therapy provides important benefits to many women, helping to combat the symptoms that menopause can bring. Women who require hormone therapy should not be put off by these results, and anyone concerned about the effects of this treatment should speak to their doctor,” she said.Dr Haitham Hamoda, the spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the chair of the British Menopause Society, said too many women were “suffering in silence” during the menopause, which could affect different women very differently.He said: “Symptoms can vary and be extremely debilitating, significantly impacting on their physical and psychological health, career, social life and relationships. The findings from this research should be helpful to both women and doctors.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Furlough ends as Rishi Sunak unveils new grant scheme to fund cost of livingGerman court issues arrest warrant for 96-year-old Nazi death camp \u0026#39fugitive\u0026#39North Korea offers to revive military hotline with the South and issues warningDemo turns violent as Taliban fires shots to break up womens\u0026#39 protestNicolas Sarkozy found guilty of illegally financing 2012 re-election bidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"A serving police officer who exploited Covid powers at the height of lockdown to falsely arrest Sarah Everard before kidnapping, raping and strangling her is today facing a whole life sentence. The crime shook the nation and led to protests and demands that streets be made safer for women. If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

And under my leadership we are committed to both. “I can promise you that under my leadership Labour will be back in business.” Here are the policies his party announced this week.  SCHOOLS : Labour would raise taxes on private schools to pay for better state education. Keir Starmer has said he would end the charity status of private schools, which would bring in £.bn factoring in VAT and business rates. He also unveiled “the most ambitious school improvement plan ever”, including thousands of extra teachers. Ofsted would also be asked to refocus on struggling schools. Referencing Tony Blairaposs education, education, education drive, Mr Starmer told delegates: Education is so important I am tempted to say it three times.EUROPE : Labour has said it would seek a new policy partnership with Europe. Mr Starmer said a Labour Government would improve on Mr Johnsonaposs Brexit deal, adding: The government is learning that it is not enough to Get Brexit Done. You need a plan to Make Brexit Work.ECONOMY: Labour would phase out business rates and replace it with a modern business tax. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she would launch a review of all tax breaks, underlining Labour would target tech firmsapos huge profits, buy-to-let landlords and those who make millions from trading stocks and shares.ENVIRONMENT : A Labour Government would invest £bn a year on making the UK more green, with cash to be targeted at including offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries. If we delay action by a decade the costs of climate transition will double, said Mr Starmer.CRIME: The Labour leader underlined Labour would become the party of law and order. He said: Today Iaposm here to tell you what I stand for. But I also want to tell you what I won’t stand for. I won’t stand for the  million incidents of anti-social behaviour this year. I won’t stand for the record levels of kne crime that we have in this country today. And I won’t stand  out of  crimes going unsolved. Labour would back a pro bono service to compel firms to offer a certain amount of free legal advice to those who need it. The Labour leader restated his partyaposs policy that it would fast-track rape and serious sexual assault cases and we will toughen sentences for rapists, stalkers and domestic abusers. DEFENCE : Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said Labour would use the £ million on supporting Afghan interpreters and veteransapos mental health. The cash for town halls would come from cancelled MoD interpreter contracts.HEALTH : Labour would double the current funding for dementia research, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth announced, and would seek to “build a national care service” in the image of the NHS. Anyone needing mental health treatment would get it from the NHS within a month under a Labour Government. Keir Starmeraposs plan for mental health includes recruiting , new staff and putting an open access mental health hub for children and young people in communities. A Labour Government would introduce a healthy living index to track happiness. Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said as the Office for Budget Responsibility tracks spending the index would monitor wellbeing and help government make better decisions.HOMES : A Labour Government would slash affordable rents and give first-time buyers exclusive rights to purchase new-build homes for six months. Declaring Labour the “party of home ownership” Mr Starmer said first-time local buyers would get priority. Mr Starmer also revealed Labour would upgrade insulation for up to  million homes. It will aim to deliver greener homes, lower bills and require an annual investment of £ billion. He said it will be Labour’s national mission over the next decade, to fit out every home that needs it, to make sure it is warm, well-insulated and costs less to heat.WORKERSapos RIGHTS : Labour would boost fairness at work with new laws introduced within the first  days of Labour winning a general election. Plans include bringing workers and employers together to negotiate pay and conditions in every sector. Labour says it would also increase statutory sick pay, back rights to flexible working and hand employers day-one rights. Labouraposs deputy leader AngelA Rayner said the measures would restore common decency in the workplace.Read moreComment MORE ON Labour PartyNHSEuropean UnionEd MilibandJohn HealeyEducationSchoolsMental healthPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet Government officials and scientists did not include them on the vaccine priority list. Speaking at the Labour Conference fringe event, Britain Talks, Darren Lewis, Assistant Editor of The Mirror, said: “This country doesn’t listen when Black and Asian people die of Covid. “We wring our hands and we get upset about it but when vaccine priorities come out and you look down that list you don’t see any Black or brown people eligible for those vaccines, because it wants to say it’s listening but it doesn’t actually listen.”  Earlier this year medical groups representing ethnic minority NHS staff had called for ethnic minorities to be prioritised in the Covid vaccine rollout with a letter backed by  healthcare organisations. They had called on the Government to put them in category six out of the nine priority groups for the vaccine. He claimed culture wars prevent Britain from talking to each other and talking for people “who don’t have the ability to articulate their position themselves.” Mr Lewis added: “Sometimes the purpose ofis to take you away from the things that we can actually change. “And derail people from changing the things that you can.” Who were the nine priority groups   - Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers - Those aged  and over and frontline health and social care workers - Those aged  and over - Those aged  and over and clinically extremely vulnerable iniduals - Those aged  and over - All iniduals aged  to  with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality - Those aged  and over - Those aged  years and over - Those aged  years of age and overMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Labour Party ConferenceNHSDarren LewisCare homesNursing homes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Special “adaptations” will be in place next spring for students sitting tests in England, according to watchdog Ofqual.A “fair and measured grading” system is aimed at ensuring kids whose education was disrupted during the coronavirus pandemic are not put at a disadvantage.Exams were axed for two years running because of the Covid-, with teachers assessing pupils’ marks, fuelling grade inflation. Changes include a choice of topics in some GCSE exams like English literature and history advance information on the focus of exams to help students revise in some subjects and “support materials like formulae sheets” in maths - aiding children’s workings out.  Grade boundaries set by exam boards will “reflect a midway point between  and  – so that more students get higher grades in  than before the pandemic”. Ofqual added: “This approach will provide a safety net for this year’s students as well as a step back to normality, with results expected toto the usual grade profile by .” The move is aimed at preventing another marking fiasco like the scandal which hit students getting A-level results in summer . Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “Weaposve put fairness at the heart of our approach and listened to pupils, teachers and parents.  “The measures we’re putting in place will help reduce the impact of the signicant disruption this group of young people have had to face – allowing them to move onto the next stage of their lives. We are committed to rigorous standards being fairly applied, and exams are the fairest way to assess students, which is why they will take place next year. The Department for Education insisted its “firm intention” was for exams to go ahead next year - but also revealed “proposals for Teacher Assessed Grades as a contingency measureexams cannot go ahead, in the event that the course or impact of the pandemic changes”. Ofqual chief regulator Jo Saxton said: “The interests of learners are central to Ofqual’s mandate for us that means fairness, it means qualications that stand the test of time, that employers, colleges and universities can trust.  “Our grading approach will recognise the disruption experienced by students taking exams in . “It will provide a safety net for those who might otherwise just miss out on a higher grade, while taking a step back to normal.” National Association of Headteachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said: “We welcome the clarity for school leaders, teachers and students which comes from the decisions announced today, although it would have been far preferable to have this before the start of the autumn term. “These changes and adaptations should help to mitigate the impacts of the disruption that students have experienced.”  He added: “Whatever decision was made about the approach to grading in , it would be open to criticism by some. “The most important thing is that this decision has been made and everyone involved now knows what to expect.” Association of School and College Leaders boss Geoff Barton said: “We are pleased that schools, colleges, and students at last have clarity about exam adaptations and grading standards for , as well as proposals for contingency arrangements in the event that exams cannot take place next summer.  “It is a sensible set of measures which should ensure that students are assessed as fairly as possible for A-levels, GCSEs and other important qualications following the huge educational disruption caused by the pandemic. “This should all have been sorted and announced much earlier. “It is frustrating that it has taken to this point – deep into the autumn term and with ongoing Covid-related disruption in schools and colleges – to set out the shape of exams for which young people are studying.” AS and A-level results will be announced on August  and GCSE grades a week later.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul WhitemanNadhim ZahawiEducationSchoolsCoronavirusGCSEsA-levelsExamsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He offered a vision for the country based on strong values, and proved he is a credible Prime Minister in waiting. It was a serious speech for serious times. The contrast with Boris Johnson couldn’t be greater. While Mr Johnson lunges from one crisis to the next and demeans his office with his arrogant disregard for the rules, Mr Starmer displayed a quiet confidence and a politics steeped in decency and dignity. The hecklers only drew attention to the fact they are now on the margins of the party. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  He does not pretend to be a glamorous politician who plays to the crowd. But he is a principled man who is genuine in his desire to create a fairer and more prosperous Britain. It was clear from the conference hall that Labour is once again hungry for power. Strong performances by the likes of Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds showed Starmer has assembled a Cabinet in waiting. The party had its ups and downs this week but it leaves Brighton on the road to recovery. Sarah agony The impact statements by the parents of Sarah Everard are heart-breaking. Their poignant words laid bare the torment they will always have to shoulder after she was murdered by Wayne Couzens. It is dficult to comprehend the trauma of losing a loved one in such a barbaric way.  That agony was made even worse by the fact this crime was committed by someone who was supposed to keep the public safe. If any good can come out of such an act of evil it must be doing everything possible to protect women and girls from violence.

I could sense the urgency in the conversation of the four nurses on my mum’s bed, he said. I knew without being told that they were keeping her alive.I can hardly convey to you the emotion of seeing your mum in that condition.  Sir Keiraposs mum Josephine Baker was diagnosed with Stillaposs disease as a youngster. The condition is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility. As his we Victoria watched, he also spelt out more about his personal le to the audience in Brighton. He felt a moment of horrible irony going to visit his mum in hospital wanting to tell her about his achievements without knowing she was fighting for her le.I had just picked up an award for work on the death penalty I’d been doing which in my own small way was about trying to save people’s lives. I’d gone to the hospital hoping to tell my mum about it. And there in front of me, those four nurses were working to save her le. Ms Baker died just two weeks before Sir Keir was elected as an MP for Holborn and St Pancras in . The Labour leader lted the lid on his personal le in the most important speech of his le. Read more He said family and work are the two rocks of his le, with his tool maker dad who gave him a deep respect for the dignity of work. Every time I enter a high-tech factory, I wonder what my dad would make of it. Not so long ago we shaped metal by drilling it, milling it and turning it.I remember my dad working with a spark eroder submerging metal in liquid and using an electrical charge to shape it.And his mum who gave him an ethic of service even though my mum was also, unfortunately, a long-term patient of the NHS. During the touching speech Sir Keir was heckled. At one point he retaliated saying: Shouting slogans or changing lives conference. The Labour leader had been apparently keen to show members and the nation more of himself.

news politics keir-starmer-promises-patriotic-responsible-\"Starmer says Johnson is a ‘trickster who has performed his one trick’ByPippa Crerar, Political Editor in Brighton:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsKeir Starmer has urged former Labour voters toto the party promising to fight the next election with a serious plan for running the country.In a powerful speech to his party’s conference in Brighton, the Labour leader faced down left-wing hecklers and closed the door firmly on the Jeremy Corbyn era.He reached out to voters who switched to the Tories at the last election telling them Labour would again be a patriotic, pro-business party that took care with taxpayers’ money.In a sign of the changing direction of the party, he praised Tony Blair ’s record in office. “You want levelling up  That’s levelling up,” he told them.What do you make of Mr Starmeraposs speech  Join the discussion in the comment section  There were big new policy pledges on mental health treatment, school standards and £bn over ten years on home insulation and double glazing saving families £ a year on bills.And he dismissed Boris Johnson as “a showman with nothing left to show” as he contrasted his values with those of the Prime Minister.Putting the Government on notice, he told the PM: “Either get a grip or get out of the way and let us clear up this mess”.  Mr Starmer’s first conference address, billed as the most important of his political le, sought to define the future of Labour under his leadership. It ended a week in which he forced through rule changes to strengthen his own grip on the party and saw the departure of the last Corbynite in his shadow cabinet. The Labour leader faced down protesters chanting “oh Jeremy Corbyn” and calling for the national minimum wage to rise to £.  “At this time on a Wednesday it’s normally the Tories who are heckling me [at Prime Minister’s Questions]. It doesn’t bother me then, doesn’t bother me now,” he told them. After yet more heckles he said they had a choice between “shouting slogans or changing lives”. To the anger of the Left, he promised to never again to go into an election “with a manesto that is not a serious plan for government”.  In a frank admission of the party’s failings under his predecessor, he admitted voters who abandoned Labour in  thought it was “unpatriotic or irresponsible” . His summer tour round the country had shown him some people “reluctantly chose the Tories because they didn’t believe our promises were credible”. He told the voters: “It will not take another election defeat for the Labour party to become an alternative government in which you can trust.  “My job as leader is not just to say thank you to the voters who stayed with us. It is to understand and persuade the voters who rejected us.” And he told his own party: “If theare so bad, what does it say about us  Because after all in  we lost to them, and we lost badly. “I know that hurts each and every one of you. So, let’s get totally serious about this.”  In his -minute address, Mr Starmer contrasted his own seriousness and competence in his former role as Director of Public Prosecutions with Boris Johnson’s frivolity. “I don’t think Boris Johnson is a bad man. I think he is a trivial man. I think he’s a showman with nothing left to show,” he said.He said the PM assumed that he didn’t need to stick to the same rules as everybody  - highlighting his defence of Dominic Cummings ’ visit to Barnard Castle. Later, he joked: “My dad was a toolmaker. Although in a way, so was Boris Johnson’s!” Mr Starmer, , opened up about his upbringing, including how he was the first member of his family to go to university.

The Labour leader credited them with teaching him “how to keep your dignity under severe pressure”. Watched by his we Victoria from the front row, Mr Starmer gave a deeply personal speech in which he described how his toolmaker father had given him respect for the dignity of work.  He opened up about the death of his mum Josephine, describing the moment he saw four nurses rushing to save her le. “The NHS that had been her livelihood became her leline,” he said.Mr Starmer, the former shadow Brexit secretary who pushed for a second referendum which turned many voters away from Labour, tackled the thorny issue head-on.“The economic inheritance from the Tories will be appalling: A botched Brexit followed by Covid has left a big hole,” he said. “The Government is learning that it is not enough to Get Brexit Done. You need a plan to Make Brexit Work.” He also reclaimed the mantle of patriotism with praise for NATO and the armed forces - but also for footballer Marcus Rashford who campaigned for free school meals and took the knee. “I couldn’t believe it when Rashford and the England team took the knee to highlight and condemn the racism they have had to endure, the Home Secretary encouraged people to boo. “Well, here in this conference hall we are patriots.

The Labour leader received a standing ovation from parts of the hall when he told the small number of antagonists: Shouting slogans, or changing lives, conference  Mr Starmer was interrupted several times during his major Labour conference speech, with the loudest heckles coming just after he talked about his late mother Josephineaposs battle with Still’s Disease. He recalled seeing her in intensive care with her bed a riot of tubes and temperature devices - and knowing that nurses were keeping her alive. Carole Vincent, a Labour member from the Leyton and Wanstead area, was holding up a red piece of paper during the speech and heckled immediately after the story, as the MP went on to speak about recognising nurses. She said: Every time he said something that I felt deserved a red cardIaposm showing him the red card every time. Andy McDonald has stepped down and given his resignation letter. Whyaposs he done that  Thataposs because he was being told to not support a £ minimum wage. How are people supposed to live  She added: He doesnapost challenge [the end of Universal Credit] and heaposs not challenging the fact that itaposs because itaposs going to leave people in a desperate situation. Earlier in the Labour leaderaposs speech, a single heckler started singing Oh Jeremy Corbyn from the balcony, to cries of “oh shut up from a handful of delegates. Another shouted, It was your Brexit policy! when he said that Labour had lost support in . Other hecklers then shouted “£!” - a reference to calls for a £ minimum wage which the leader rejected - as he spoke about poverty pay. Mr Starmer joked that “at this time on a Wednesday, it’s normally the Tories who are heckling me in a reference to his usual PMQs clash with Boris Johnson The leader was also booed when he joked that Sunday - when he pushed through rule changes - was “particularly nerve-wracking”… because of Arsenal’s - victory over Tottenham. The loudest heckles in the early part of the speech appeared to come from a handful of delegates directly in front of the leader, a few rows back from his podium in Brighton.  Supporters of the Labour leader suggested the protest may have been organised, after a leaflet encouraged members to “show Starmer the RED CARD” an hour before his speech. A spokesman for Sir Keir insisted the hecklers were a “small number of people” who “didn’t knock Keir Starmer off his stride”. Asked why the hecklers were not removed he said: “It was a small number of people so it needs to be kept in proportion.” The conference was riven by factional warfare after the Labour leader pushed through rule changes giving MPs tighter control on who can run for party leader. Relations with the left collapsed further after Andy McDonald quit the shadow cabinet to support a motion calling for a £ legal minimum wage - which passed last night. Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded the conference a “s***show” and accused Mr Starmer of going back on his promises. Former leader Jeremy Corbyn accused his successor of wanting to “prop up” the wealthy and powerful. But Mr Starmer denied his party was more ided than ever. In a damning attack on his predecessor - who he did not mention by name - he said: “We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manesto that is not a serious plan for government.” Comment MORE ON Labour Party ConferenceKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A new report, Moving Animals Across Borders, from the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee calls on the Government to introduce harsher jail punishments for pet smugglers - and make full use of existing powers. Committee chairman Neil Parish, a senior Conservative backbencher, said: “While the Government twiddles its thumbs, bad actors are seizing the opportunity to bring animals - including kittens and puppies - over the borders, risking their welfare and the spread of diseases, with little fear of detection or punishment.”  The -page report says: “The Animal WelfareBill will reduce the number of pets that an inidual can bring into Great Britain from five to three. “This is a positive step, which should help to reduce pet smuggling. However, there is evidence that the current rules are not being enforced at the border making it easy for pets to be illegally brought into the country. “Prosecution rates and the sentences for pet smuggling are low, and do not act as an effective deterrent. “The Government should increase the sentences given to pet smugglers, including greater consideration of custodial sentences. Increasing prosecution rates must also be a priority, as prosecution rates are proportionately low given the estimated size of the trade.  “Furthermore, Defra should include a ban on animals younger than six months, heavily pregnant animals, and animals which have been subject to poor welfare practices on the face of the Bill, rather than in secondary legislation. “The Bill should also include a clear definition of ‘heavily pregnant’.” The Government last month announced plans to raise the minimum age for imported puppies from  weeks to six months and banning the importing of dogs with cropped ears or docked tails.  Importing heavily pregnant dogs into the UK would also be banned. The number of puppies seized at the border jumped from  in  to  last year amid a surge in demand blamed on coronavirus lockdowns. Some , dogs were imported into the UK last year. But Defra believes cases of poor treatment and smuggling are rising. Todayaposs study comes nearly  months after Lucy’s Law came into force in a triumph for the Mirror’s campaign to end the horrors of cruel puppy farms.  The legislation made it illegal for third party dealers, such as pet shops and online traders, to sell puppies - and is designed to stop unscrupulous breeders having a route to market. Anyone wanting to buy a puppy or kitten in England must purchase directly from a breeder or consider adopting from a rescue centre. Licensed dog breeders must show puppies interacting with their mothers in their place of birth The campaign was founded by vet Marc Abraham – a past winner of a Mirror Animal Hero Award – and named after a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who was rescued after years of abuse on a puppy farm.  Marc said at the time: “This is a huge milestone, the first major step in ending puppy farming and puppy smuggling. “It will also tackle the legal licensed trade which has enabled puppies and kittens to be sold after being bred in the most horrendous conditions.” A Defra spokeswoman said: “The Government takes the issue of puppy smuggling, and other illegal importations and low welfare movements of pets, very seriously. “It is an abhorrent trade which causes suffering to animals and puts the health of pets and people in the UK at risk. “Our recently introduced Animal WelfareBill commits to tackling unscrupulous traders by reducing the number of dogs that can be moved under the pet travel rules - and we have now launched a consultation on further proposals to crack down on this illegal trade.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Neil ParishConservative PartyPoliticsAnimalsDogsBan Puppy ImportsPuppy LoveTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Though usually associated with older adults, the past  months have led to % of --year-olds reporting back problems.Causes including longer periods working from home, playing video games and even being hunched over while cooking as lockdown meant fewer meals out, reports Nottinghamshire Live.Many do not have proper desks and seats on which to work from home, increasing the likelihood of back pain, said the survey of , young adults by www.mindyourbackuk, a public health campaign from Mentholatum, makers of Deep Heat and Deep Freeze.It estimates that back pain costs the UK £billion a year through lost work, productivity and other costs - four in  sick days are caused by back problems, said the survey.  Dr Gill Jenkins, advisor to www.mindyourbackuk, said: For the six in ten Brits who have been mostly or always working from home during the pandemic and are now hybrid working, almost half donapost have constant access to a table and supportive chair during their working day. And unfortunately,  per cent have to work while sitting on a sofa or bed. This plays absolute havoc with posture and spine health. Only  per cent of those forced to work from home were given workstation equipment from their employers and  per cent bought specialist chairs during lockdown. The average working day also increased by an average of  minutes for those working from home and one in five of those polled said they did no exercise at all during a typical working week during lockdown. Only seven per cent followed the standard recommendation to walk and stretch every hour while working at a desk. Among those who suffered back pain,  per cent said it was in their lower back and  per cent in their neck or shoulder blades - both common problems associated with working at screens which are not at eye level or in chairs that fail to support the back. Dr Jenkins added: Caring for our backs can reduce stress and boost energy so we can live our lives to the full, without pains and achesholding us back.Work from home advice from the campaign includes gentle stretching exercises for a few minutes each day as well as either walking, cycling or swimming as low impact activities to ease non-specic back pain.

UK regulators have only approved single jabs for  to  year olds, unlike the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and much of Europe. A study indicated up to , cases of long Covid may be prevented in childrenthey were double jabbed. It is not clear how many of these cases would be avoided with just one dose. Lead author Dr Deepti Gurdasani, of Queen Mary University of London, said: “This analysis shows on clinical risks alone, vaccination is warranted for  to  year olds in England. Should kids be double jabbed  Have your say in the comment section  “While we wait to understand the long-term effects of Covid- on children, the precautionary principle advocates for protecting all children from exposure to this virus and vaccination is a crucial part of that protection.” The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has so far only advised offering one dose of the Pfizer vaccine for  to  year olds. Co-author Prof Martin McKee, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The approach is completely out of line with that of advisers in many other countries so it really should explain why it thinks they are wrong.”  The US has fully vaccinated over  million under-s and France has fully vaccinated more than % of its - year olds. Researchers examined hospital admissions, deaths and long Covid over a -week period. As of September , around  out of every ,  to -year-olds got Covid- every week. If this soars to , per week over  weeks, they estimate full vaccination of  to -year-olds will “avert , hospital admissions and  deaths”. If cases plummet to  per week then “vaccination could avert  hospital admissions and two deaths over  weeks,” they added. Cases of long Covid that could be included ranged from , to ,. Dr Gurdasani said: “While children with pre-existing illnesses may be at greater inidual risk, % of hospitalisations in under-s in England have been children who do not have such conditions – suggesting considerable benefits for all children in reducing severe illness.”  The study found the benefits of a second jab outweigh the risks “unless case rates are sustainably low”. However, Dr Alasdair Munro, from Southampton University, said: “This research does not attempt to qualy the dference between a single dose compared to two doses. “This is current UK policy, made on the basis that a single dose offers the vast majority of the benefit of reductions of risk of hospitalisation and death, and avoids the worst of the potential adverse events.” Comment MORE ON Pfizer Inc.EducationHospitalsSecondary schoolCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People living in Page Moss said it has been a long-running problem in the area but one resident, who did not want to be named, claimed itaposs never been this bad.A video shows one rat running up and down a house in broad daylight, reports the Liverpool Echo.The woman claimed that kids canapost play in the garden due to vermin and people are being kept awake at all hours by the pests. She said: Rat traps arenapost setting them off anymore, theyaposre that big, the traps arenapost catching them. I wouldnapost have believed it myselfI hadnapost have seen it on my own CCTV. You hear the bins going every night, you have people finding live rats in the bins and having to kill them themselves. Theyaposre the size of a normal cat, not a big cat, but theyaposre massive.  The resident claims the rats are chewing through car wires and childrenaposs toys have to be disinfectedtheyaposve been outside. She added: There was a time where it looked like the scene from Mary Poppins where the rats were jumping on the chimneys, there were seven jumping on my front fence. Youaposve got them chewing the car, we have a work van and and theyaposre chewing wires, itaposs a pandemic. Itaposs a lovely area to live in, everyone is so lovely everyone looks after each other. But weaposre all suffering, our kids canapost play in the garden. If you leave toys youaposre having to disinfect them, youaposre having to brush up rat droppings every day from round the bins. People arenapost getting a good night sleep because the bins are going at pm to until am. The Page Moss resident said she believes there are a number of reasons why the problem has worsened. A Knowsley Council spokesperson said: “We are responding to a number of pest control reports in the Page Moss area. As well as dealing with incidents at specic properties, we have also been working with United Utilities to introduce a sewer baiting programme across Knowsley and this has been running for over a year now. “With regard to bin collections, our Waste Collection service has been impacted signicantly by the COVID- pandemic over the last  months.  As well as our own staff being absent due to the virus or needing to self-isolate, we have been unable to source agency staff cover for the same reasons. With more residents working from home , access to some roads has also been problematic. There have been some missed collections, and we put arrangements in place toto collect any missed bins as soon as we can. Our teams have worked additional hours and over weekends to try to deal with these challenges. “Like other areas across the country, Knowsley saw an increase in fly tipping cases throughout the pandemic. It is extremely disappointing when these cases arise. Again, despite the staffing challenges, we are doing everything we can to deal with reports of fly tipping as quickly as possible. We are also using enforcement powers in cases when land is not being cleared of waste and vegetation by private landowners. We gave notice to landowners on Woolfall Crescent in Page Moss requiring them to clear their land, but the owners went into liquidation. As a result, we will step in to clear the land and will also assess the waste with a view to identying the people who have left it and pursuing prosecution where possible.” Comment MORE ON Animals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So when Sarah’s dad Jeremy stood to deliver his victim impact statement, he was determined to face his daughter’s killer. “Mr Couzens, please look at me,” he said to the defendant. There was silence in the court as Couzens raised his head and looked into Jeremy’s eyes. For the first time, there was a sign of emotion from the killer. He began shaking and appeared to sob.

Tanya Burrell, , was first diagnosed with scleroderma around eight years ago after she developed an abscess on her finger.The condition affects the skin and can cause problems with organs, reports ChronicleLive.Then at the start of lockdown, Tanya began feeling breathless while doing everyday tasks around the house and went to get it checked out. After tests, she was diagnosed with another rare disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension - which is thought to be a secondary disease to her scleroderma. This condition means the right side of her heart is under intense pressure and is struggling to supply enough blood to the lungs to then oxygenate the body.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. Sadly Tanya, from Sunderland, is currently in the last stage of the condition - which her daughter said is like a ticking time bomb. Gayle Carr, , said: My mam was fine the day before and then literally the next day she was feeling so out of breath so I think it was quite a shock. She couldnapost breathe, she couldnapost do normal tasks like making a meal or going to the toilet because she was so out of breath. She thought it was her lungs because she had shortness of breath and was feeling so tired. Doctors tragically then told the family Tanya has just months left, which Gayle said dropped on her mum like a bombshell. The daughter said: She was always doing this and that and then from getting scleroderma she has to be put on medication because she had no immune system and she had to stop work because she couldnapost risk picking anything up.  She was finally coming to terms with what was happening then this dropped on her like a bombshell. My birthday was last Sunday and staff at the hospital said we were lucky to celebrate my birthday together because otherwise we might not spend my birthday together again and I didnapost expect that. It just feels surreal. The conditions have left Tanya wheelchair-bound and on constant oxygen with the mum in and out of Newcastleaposs Freeman Hospital as she needs to have constant observation and close management. She is due to start a new treatment this week which is hoped will extend her le by  to  months but is the last treatment available to her. Gayle said her mum hates not being able to do things for herself and is having to rely on other people to do things for her.  She said: My mam is very up and down at the moment, sometimes she has a positive head on, the next day she canapost cope with it anymore. She just wants to be able to go to the toilet and do normal, everyday things without being breathless. Sheaposs trying to be positive but I think sheaposs a bit bogged down because sheaposs on oxygen all the time and then sheaposs having to rely on everybody. Sheaposs back and forwards to the hospital. She said not being able to do anything for herself is hard because she never had to ask anything from anyone and having to ask people kills her. Tanya is extremely close to her grandchildren, especially Gayleaposs son Jake, five, and is heartbroken she wonapost see them grow up. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information at www.mirror email .Gayle said: My mam lives two minutes down the road and sheaposs been with him every single day so their bond is so strong and sheaposs heartbroken for that reason that she wonapost get to see him grow up. Itaposs hard because heaposs so young and he doesnapost understand why my mam canapost sit on the floor and play with his toys with him. To make her time left as special as possible, Gayle is raising money to take her mum to Skegness which is a place close to her heart. Gayle said: Since my mam was a little girl, she always went to Skegness and loved it. Weaposve all gone there so sheaposs been there as a child, a mother, and a grandmother. If there is any money left over, the family would also like to take Tanya to Edinburgh Zoo butTanya sadly passes before they get to do anything, then any money raised will be donated to the Freeman Hospital.If you would like to donate to the GoFundMe page, you can do so here.

On Saturday, the couple appeared at a gig in New York calling for action on climate change before later using a private jet tohome to their £million home in Calornia.Former government minister Norman Baker, , told Newsweek : Itaposs completely hypocritical for Prince Harry or other members of the royal family to lecture people about climate change when theyaposre emitting more carbon than almost everyone  on the planet.People using private jets are in the top one percent of carbon emitters in the world. Prince Harry needs to stop using private jets orhe wants to use private jets, he needs to stop lecturing people on climate change. It is not particularly challenging to get a flight from New York to Calornia - people do it all the time. His criticism comes after the couple reportedly used  private jets in two years. While in New York, the pair carried out their first public engagement since welcoming baby Lilibet in a visit of New York City, that gave a subtle nod to the couple’s royal roots. The Sussexes arrived in the city on Thursday, visiting a   memorial along with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and the stateaposs governor, Kathy Hochul. While in New York, they booked to stay at The Carlyle, known as New Yorkaposs “Tower of Power”, and were spotted having a drink at the hotel’s bar.  The Carlyle was known to be a favourite of Harryaposs mum Princess Diana, who often stayed there when she was in the city. They were seen embracing members of staff who had accompanied them on their brief visit before going back to their Montecito mansion. During their trip and while touring the One World Observatory on Thursday, the couple spoke about mental health with Mr De Blasio. The New York City mayor said: “They’re good people and they’re really committed to the world. “I got a great vibe, particularly the work that they’re doing on mental health ... I think the prince makes a great point when he says, ‘mental fitness,’ calling it ‘mental fitness’ as a positive aspirational idea. That was one of the things we talked about.

The results show that it’s Londoners who have the biggest appetite for heat:  per cent of those in the capital said they like their food to be nice and spicy or even to feel their mouths on fire. The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right.

Outbreaks of rain are expected in most parts of the country today, forecasters have said. Temperatures will be slightly warmer than yesterday, despite windy conditions.Highs of around C or C are expected, Met Office meteorologist Clare Nasir said. Ms Nasir explained: The key feature of the weather will be the wind which will be gale-force along the western side of the country through Thursday.The heaviest rain will be in the north and west, the Met Office said.  Driving conditions might be tricky due to spray and standing water on some roads combined with blustery winds. In the southeast, strong coastal gales are likely, forecasters warned. Tomorrow, the day will start on a cloudy note, with a mixture of sunshine and showers following.  Due to coastal gales, some exposed areas will feel cool, the Met Office explained. More showers are expected at the weekend, with heavy and more prolonged rain moving north and east during Saturday. The weather will continue to be windy, with gales possible in the south and east late on Saturday and in the northeast on Sunday.  According to the Met Office long-range forecast, rain and thunder could arrive and stay over the next few weeks as the start of October is likely to be a miserable one. The forecast from Saturday, October  to Monday, October  says that a low pressure system from the north will dominate, bringing with it heavy rain and isolated thunderstorms for all. The forecast adds: Thereafter, further low pressure systems will affect the UK, particularly northwestern areas. This will bring organised bands of rain, heavy at times, interspersed with cooler and showery periods but some sunny spells too.  Drier and more settled conditions are likely across southern and eastern parts of the country, but there is still a chance that bands of rain and strong winds from the north and west could extend into these areas. Temperatures are also expected to be slightly lower than normal at the start of the period before theyto near average. There is some hope for the middle of October as well, with the Met Office saying that high pressure may dominate in the south between October  and , bringing with it drier and more settled conditions. UK  day weather forecast Today: Outbreaks of rain affecting many areas, though far southeast England probably staying dry until later. Some bright spells possible, mainly east of hills. A little warmer than Wednesday despite being windy. Tonight: Mostly cloudy with outbreaks of rain continuing, heavy at times in the west, although some clear spells are possible across northeast Scotland. Rather windy with coastal gales in the southeast. Friday: Cloud and rain, locally heavy, clearing east. Mixture of sunshine and showers following, locally heavy with hail and thunder in the northwest. Feeling cooler with coastal gales at times. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Sunny spells and showers, with heavy and more prolonged rain moving north and east during Saturday. Windy gales possible in the south and east late Saturday and northeast Sunday.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Blainie White, , died after a long battle with Battens Disease at her home in the Scottish Highland village of Kiltarlity this month. The rare condition is thought to affect only  in , people in the UK and affects the nervous system, causing seizures, visual impairment, mobility loss and early death.Most children with the disease tragically die between six and  years, the Daily Record reports. Her mother, Valerie, said despite her condition leaving her wheelchair-bound and blind by the end of her le, Blainie always had a smile on her face.  Valerie said: Blainie was the happiest child smiled every day despite her condition and the toll it took on her, she had the most infectious laugh and absolutely adored silliness and nonsense. Blainie had Battenaposs Disease which has a iety of dferent forms or cln’s her particular type was cln sadly a rarer form of the disease, and no treatment or cure for this. Battens disease is a le limiting neurodegeneretive disease and ultimately it is a problem with cell s and the ability to use, store and waste protein and lipids in the cells so they cannotproperly- for Blainie she was born as what appeared healthy and met each milestone up until she was around four years old where she then started showing symptoms.” Blaine began displaying symptoms before she was taken to medics before the condition began “robbing her of everything”.  Her mum added:simply falling when running then walking and very quickly she soon became dependent on a wheelchair to get around her sight gradually got worse and ultimately she lost her sight by age , her motor skills and speech followed and she required to a PEG for feeding and meds. Seizures started for Blainie subtly when she was around six and at first these weren’t too much of a bother but they became worse and very dficult to control despite numerous dferent medications the frequency and severity of seizures always took over. Battens robs a child on everything step by step they fist start losing their mobility not just making the child immobile the disease causes muscle stfness and joint tightness which causes them great pain and discomfort then speech and eating seizures, soon they slowly start having dementia like symptoms they start to lose interest in everything in le and rely on everyone to provide them with the most basic tasks. You have to watch your once healthy child slowly wasting away in pain and distress everyday of their le’s yet somehow this amazing girl still found the energy to smile and be happy.”  Valerie paid tribute to her little girl and said she was her “strength and inspiration”, adding: It brings some comfort to know that her passing means she will no longer be in pain but will be deeply sadly missed and has left a void that could never be filled.” Friends and family also paid tribute to Blainie, with one writing: “She lit up all our lives with her beautul laugh and smile. Rest in peace darling girl.” Another person added: Absolutely heartbroken to hear this. Blainie was such a beautul wee soul with brightest smile and heartfelt giggles.”For more information on the condition or to donate to the Battens Disease Family Association pleaseclick here.Comment MORE ON Daily RecordMental health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Katie Burton had been playing with her toddlers Penelope and George on July  this year when they decided to go inside to cool down.They were sitting together before George, , wandered off to watch TV in another room, prompting Penelope, one, to follow him, Manchester Evening News reported. When the -year-old Bolton mum got up to go to the kitchen, she noticed something in the paddling pool outside. As her eyes focused, she realised it was Penelope laying motionless in the water.  The tot had entered the garden through the open patio doors and accidentally fallen into the large paddling pool. To the midweaposs horror, she was laying face down and completely unresponsive. After screaming for Penelope’s father Grant to call an ambulance, Katie immediately dragged her tiny body from the water and started performing CPR. It wasn’t long until a flock of emergency service vehicles, including an air ambulance, arrived at the scene. Little Penelope was rushed to the intensive care unit at Manchester Children’s Hospital where she was placed into a week-long coma.  After that she was transferred to the neurological ward where she stayed with her family for  weeks. Despite the best efforts of doctors, scans showed that she had suffered a severe brain injury and needs medication and therapies now back at home. She has been left unable to sit, speak or eat and doctors don’t knowshe will ever fully recover. Katie, who is -weeks pregnant with her third child, described the moment she spotted her leless daughter in the pool. “I was numb, I was so shocked,” she said. “I couldn’t even think. I just thought, ‘Oh my god, don’t leave me’. Katie and Grant say they have spent the last few weeks teaching Penelope “everything from the beginning. They are now desperately searching for medications and treatments to improve her condition. Katie continued: “One of the things I would like to come out of this is for people to learn CPR. “Hopefully people wonapost ever need to use it butthey do it could be lesaving. “Penelope is on loads of medication and is being fed through a tube. “She’s like a new-born baby all over again. “She was talking and walking before, now she can’t talk and she can’t walk. “She has started smiling – so we’re hoping that’s the start. “She might start crawling. We’re teaching her everything from the beginning. “Doctors say she may struggle with mobility in the future. “She’s our baby and she’s completely dferent to what she was. “It’s really sad.”They have since set up a fundraiser through JustChildren, a charity for ill children, to help give Penelope the best quality of le.So far, it’s raised an incredible £,. The money will go towards expensive overseas treatments and those not available on the NHS.

Public relations manager Elizabeth McKenzie, , was “struggling to come to terms with the impending end of her marriage”, the coroner heard. A successful career had seen her manage high profile events like the Royal Opera Gala in  that Prince Charles attended but due to the pandemic she was put on furlough.

Ms Cartledge said her niece was an outgoing person who had endured a dficult year. She said: “The last year had been terrible for her. The pandemic meant she was furloughed and her marriage was in trouble, they were about to embark in orce.  On the morning of her death, she told me she was not doing too well.

Alan Pritchard, , from Pembroke Dock in south Wales, rescued his best pal Kane through German Shepherd Rescue Elite five years ago. But now Alan spends half-a-grand each month to give Kane a fighting chance against Fibrocartilaginous embolism . The condition causes matter from the spinal disc to migrate into the circulatory system, blocking vessels in the spine. Experts are unsure of the cause of the condition, but symptoms can develop after minor injuries or trauma. Alan was advised to put Kane to sleep two years ago when he was nine after his legs gave out due to old age. But the -year-old wasnapost ready to give up on Kane and sought out canine back treatments.He told TeamDogs : I found an FCE group on Facebook where people were recommending hydrotherapy and acupuncture, so we got in touch with a local vet who offered these services and we have been with them ever since. We only see one vet now because Kane was people reactive when we got him. He was tied up on a farm and wearing a prong collar. The farmer had died and his we had gone into a hospice, so Kane was taken in to rescue. Oak Vets started him off with acupuncture and hydrotherapy on a treadmill but then he broke his dewclaw. He had two hydrotherapy sessions and it became ulcerated. We treated it for  months and it would just not heal and during that time he couldnapost continue with his hydrotherapy. He had also started having canine massages. Abi worked very hard with him and we did physio at home with him. Oak Vets thought he had FCE because he had no feeling in his feet, so we had him referred to Langford Vets in Bristol where he was diagnosed and had to stay for a week. Kaneaposs ulcer was still not healed after  months, so vets recommended his leg be amputated last September. Straight after the amputation, he was trying to run around. He gets around quite well on three legs. He only goes out on his wheels occasionally because after five or ten minutes he starts to drag his back leg. I have to keep him on his lead when he is on his wheels in case he tips them up. We were also advised to take him to see a doggy chiropractor as the masseuse was finding it hard to work deep on him. So we got in touch with one and the results when she visits him are amazing. When she has realigned his vertebrae heaposs like a young dog again. We donapost notice the gradual decline so we book him in every  weeks. Kaneaposs weekly treatment schedule includes a canine massage every two weeks, with hydrotherapy pool and physio sessions with Running Free. Over the past two years Alan says he and we Judith have spent a small fortune on the pooch. Alan says £-£ of his state pension goes towards his best palaposs treatment. My state pension goes on him. We bought him the best wheels we could find. We donapost keep tabs on what we have spent on him but itaposs probably five figures, but in  months we have spent a fortune. Heaposs such a happy boy, he is just an incredible dog and is very strong-willed. Our special thanks go to Caroline Gardner at Oak Vets Haverfordwest, Abi Fernandez at A.F Therapy, Simon and Lisa Mazengarb of Running Free Animal Physiotherapy and last but not least Sarah Wilkinson McTimoney Animal Chiropractor.Comment MORE ON PensionsState pensionTherapyBig DogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate looked stunning in a custom sparkling gold sequinned Jenny Packham cape gown and wore her hair up to show off her beautul gold earrings by Onitaa. Camilla opted for a pale blue corseted chfon dress with silver embroidery by Bruce Oldfield. Meanwhile, both Charles and William channelled  himself by wearing black tuxedos. The outing was the first time the foursome had attended a joint engagement in over a year. Then they visited a veteransapos rehabilitation centre together in Loughborough.

But despite having a busy night last night, there was no time to rest for William and Kate today. This afternoon they arrived in Northern Ireland for a visit to Derry-Londonderry and to see students and staff at Ulster Universityaposs Magee Campus. And Kate stunned once again as she bravely held a tarantula spider, called Charlotte, and let it run crawl her hands while touring the university as a seemingly nervous William looked on. After dazzling at the Bond premiere last night, Kate swapped her glittering gown for a vibrant magenta trouser suit by Emilia Wickstead with a dark roll neck jumper and wore her hair in a ponytail.

Serving police officer Couzens deceived Sarah by telling her she was under arrest her as she made her way home from a friendaposs in Clapham, south London, on March  this year. It took just under five minutes for Couzens to get Sarah into the car he had hired before he then drove to Kent where he raped and strangled her. In emotional scenes in court, Sarahaposs dad Jeremy Everard asked for a photograph of my beautul daughter to be put on screen as he read a statement, saying: She also had a beautul mind. He then asked the judge: Can I ask for Mr Couzens to face me  Mr Couzens, please look at me. Couzens appeared to be sobbing behind his mask and was shaking as he looked up for the first time in the hearing. When Sarahaposs sister Katie Everard stood up she also asked Couzens: Can you please look at me.  In a heartbreaking victim impact statement, Sarahaposs mother Susan told how she had kept her youngest childaposs dressing gown still smells of her and said their family will never be the same again. She says she has dreamt of her daughter and every night at the time she was taken by Couzens she lets out a silent scream of: Donapost get in the car, Sarah. Donapost believe him. Run! Sarahaposs mother said the family waited two agonising days after her body was found to discover how she died. She said she feared her daughter had been set on fire before she died and said the burning of her body was the final insult and meant they could never see her sweet face and never say goodbye. In his statement, Sarahaposs father Jeremy said his daughteraposs killing was in his mind all of the time. He said: A father wants to look after his children and fix everything and you have deliberately and with pre meditation stopped my ability to do that. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us. Sarahaposs sister Katie heartbreakingly told how the family had to visit Sarahaposs home to pack up her whole le and found signs of a le waiting to be lived.  Chores to be done, ready for her toand continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. She said: Washing left hanging up, half sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be ed, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened. All signs of a le waiting to be lived. The last moments of her le not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her le. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. You have ruined so many lives. Dozens of people in the public gallery sobbed as all three statements were read. Sarahaposs family statements in full... Statement from Sarahaposs mum, Susan Sarahaposs mum Susan told the court: Sarah is gone and I am broken hearted. She was my precious little girl, our youngest child. The feeling of loss is so great it is visceral. And with the sorrow come waves of panic at not being able to see her again. I can never talk to her, never hold her again, and never more be a part of her le. We have kept her dressing gown - it still smells of her and I hug that instead of her. Sarah died in horrendous circumstances. I am tormented at the thought of what she endured. I play it out in my mind. I go through the terrible sequence of events. I wonder when she realized she was in mortal danger I wonder what her murderer said to her. When he strangled her, for how long was she conscious, knowing she would die  It is torture to think of it. Sarah was handcuffed, unable to defend herself and there was no one to rescue her. She spent her last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her le because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires. It is a ridiculous reason, it is nonsensical how could he value a human le so cheaply  I cannot comprehend it. I am incandescent with rage at the thought of it. He treated my daughter asshe was nothing and disposed of her asshe was rubbish. If Sarah had died because of an illness, she would have been cared for. We could have looked after her and been with her. If she had died because of an accident, people would have tried to help - there would have been kindness. But there is no comfort to be had, there is no consoling thought in the way Sarah died. In her last hours she was faced with brutality and terror, alone with someone intent on doing her harm. The thought of it is unbearable. I am haunted by the horror of it. When Sarah went missing we suffered days of agony, not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. Then, when Sarah’s burnt remains were found, we spent two terrible days waiting for tests to show how she had died, fearing she had been set alight before she was dead - the thought was appalling. Burning her body was the final insult, it meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled. I yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her: she was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautul dancer. She was a wonderful daughter. She was always there to listen, to advise, or simply to share with the minutiae of the day. And she was also a strongly principled young woman who knew right from wrong and who lived by those values. She was a good person. She had purpose to her le. My outlook on le has changed since Sarah died: I am more cautious I worry more about our other children. I crave the familiarity and security of home the wider world has lost its appeal. It is too painful to contemplate a future without Sarah, so I just live in the here and now. I think of Sarah all the time, but the mornings and evenings are particularly painful. In the morningI wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Don’t get in the car, Sarah. Don’t believe him. Run!I am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah. I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted. Sarah wanted to get married and have children, now all that has gone. He took her le and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think, Sarah should be here, leading her le and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her.I don’t know how anyone could be so cruel as to take my daughter’s le. What I do know is that Sarah will never be forgotten and is remembered with boundless love. I cling on to memories of Sarah, I hold them tight to keep them safe. The other night, I dreamt that Sarah appeared at home. In my dream I held her and could feel her physically. Jeremy was there, we were comforting her, saying “it’s alright Sarah, it’s alright”. I would give anything to hold her once more I hope I dream that dream again. Statement from Sarahaposs dad, Jeremy Sarahaposs father, Jeremy, told the court: The impact of what you have done will never end. The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my le. A father wants to look after his children and fix everything and you have deliberately and with pre meditation stopped my ability to do that. Sarah was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. This preys on my mind all the time. I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us. You burnt our daughter’s body - you further tortured us - so that we could not see her again. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye. Her body fell apart when she was moved. Her brain and neck bones were removed for months by the pathologist and her body was dficult to preserve so we had to use the services of a specialist embalmer to enable a dignied burial. All my family want is Sarah back with us. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us. You murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sister, family and her friends. Sarah had so much to look forward to and because of YOU this is now gone forever. She was saving to buy a house and looking forward to marriage and children. We were looking forward to having grandchildren. We loved being a part of Sarah’s world and expected her to have a full and happy le. The closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day. Statement from Sarahaposs sister, Katie Sarahaposs sister, Katie told the court in her victim impact statement: You treated Sarah asshe was nothing. Placed more emphasis on satisfying your sick disgusting perversions than on a le. Her le. You disposed of my sisteraposs body like it was rubbish. Fly-tipped her like she meant nothing. She meant everything. We couldnapost even see her, she was so badly burnt. Her brain was removed from her skull to check for trauma and cause of death - I still donapost knowthey put her brain back in her head or whether it is lying next to her body in her coffin. Shards of her kneecap were ed to us to be placed with her body - shards that you knocked when moving her burnt body from the fridge you had used to hide her and conceal the fire. We are still missing her hyoid bone from her throat, which is being checked to see the force you used to strangle her, to determine how long she may have survived. We know it was broken. Her burnt body still had her necklace and one earring in her ear - the other had fallen from her ear because it had burnt off. You hear from the police that it takes around  minutes to strangle someone. And around - seconds for them to lose consciousness. At first there is a sense of relief at hearing that your sister might only have been aware of what was happening for - seconds. But have you put your hands around your neck and tried pushing hard  - seconds now seems a long time. You used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in a car handcuffed for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong  What lies did you tell her  When did she realise that she wasnapost going to survive the night  Iaposm constantly replaying in my head - did you rape her, then kill her  Did you kill her while raping her  You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again. Your semen and blood were found in your car. So this suggests you raped her in the car. You find out you may have used a belt to strangle her. New horrendous images forming. You stopped to get a Lucozade and water at a petrol station. Was she still alive at this point  Bound in your car  I am horried by your ability to flit between what you did and normal everyday actions. Your casual demeanour on cctv was very upsetting and shocking to see. We had to go to the flat and pack up Sarahaposs whole le - washing left hanging up, half sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be ed, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened. All signs of a le waiting to be lived - chores to be done, ready for her toand continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. You canapost comprehend what you are being told when it happened because it is so horric. Some sort of sick waking nightmare. You canapost imagine anyone could do such a thing.You are waiting to hear anything from the police. Every bit you get is dferent. You hear her body has been found. Then you find out she has been burnt. So badly burnt you canapost see her. Canapost see her again to say goodbye. The first thought you have in your head after despair and shock is - was she dead before you burnt her  Imagine that even having to be a thought. You find out no soot was found in her lungs which suggests she was burnt after you murdered her. Imagine being relieved to hear your sister was dead before she was burnt.I replay it continuously round in my head. What you may have said to her, what she may have said back, when she realised she was in grave danger and was not going to survive.Hoping my sister was unconscious and drugged, but we know that was not the case - no drugs found in her body, no trauma to the head. Burst blood vessels in her brain from your strangulation. Which meant she was conscious when you were doing these unfathomable things to her. My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasnapost aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon and raped her. When you put your hands around her neck and strangled her. It disgusts me that you were the last person to touch her perfect body and violate her in the way you did. The last person to see her alive and speak to her. How scared she must have been.The last moments of her le not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her le. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. No kindness. I hate that I wasnapost there to save her. To stop you. I find it hard to believe she is not just living her own le and sick at the thought that her last moments on this earth alive were so horric.How dare you take her from me  Take away her hopes and dreams. Her le. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. Her future no longer exists. The future I was supposed to live with my sister no longer exists. You have ruined so many lives.Sarah is the very best person with so many people who love and cherish her. I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing. All those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each otheraposs bridesmaid, meeting her babies and being an Aunty, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. We werenapost even halfway through our journey and you took it all away! I feel like I live in a make-believe world. Asnothing is real. I have to pretend because the thought of not having Sarah forever is too hard to bear. A letime now seems a very long time. I should never have to write a eulogy for or bury my little sister. There is no punishment that you could receive that will ever compare to the pain you have caused us. We can never get Sarah back. The last moments of Sarahaposs le play on my mind constantly. I am so disgusted and appalled. It terries me that you have such disregard for a personaposs le. You have taken from me the most precious person. And I can never get her back.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sarah Everard\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She vanished as she walked through Clapham in south London after Couzens had been driving for hours around the city. The court heard just three days before, he had taken out a hire car in Devon and had even bought handcuffs from Amazon for the crime.  Prosecutor Tom Little told the court Sarah would have walked all the way back had she not have been kidnapped. However, tragically she was arrested by Couzens who had showed her his warrant and taken on an -mile journey before she was raped, strangled and her body set on fire. Sarahaposs body was found in a woodland stream in Kent, metres away from land owned by Couzens on March .  Mr Little said that at some point, after not being taken to a police station, Sarah must have realised her fate. Her killing prompted outrage across the UK and sparked protests at the rate of violence against women. Sarahaposs family came face-to-face with evil Couzens for the first time today as they sat in the well of packed court . Her father told Couzens to look at him as he read out his heartbreaking victim impact statement to the court.  Jeremy Everard said: The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my le. A father wants to look after his children and fix everything and you have deliberately and with premeditation stopped my ability to do that. The footage is from dash-cam and bus CCTV. One image shows the two of them standing behind his distinctive hire car with its hazards on. Another shows her in the back seat Mr Little said: “Sarah Everard is standing on the pavement, behind the car, facing the defendant who is a few feet away. The defendant appears to touch his belt and to be holding up his hand towards Sarah Everard, asshowing her something in it. “A couple were travelling on the south circulate in their car to their home address in south-east London and witnessed the kidnap of Sarah Everard.. The front seat passenger noticed what she described as a man and a woman standing on the pavement with the man behind the woman. “The man was wearing dark clothing and she started to watch more closely because she saw a handcuff. The woman on the pavement already had her left arm behind her back. “She was in the process of aposgiving her other arm behind her backapos as the man, who must have been the defendant, placed the handcuff on her right arm.  “She was compliant, with her head down and did not appear to be arguing. The defendant appeared to be confident. The immediate impression the passenger formed was that she was witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman, whom she assumed aposmust have done something wrong.apos “So surprised was the witness by what she had seen, as she considered it to be relatively unusual and not something she had ever witnessed before, she remarked to her husband, ‘I’ve just seen a woman being handcuffed’.  She then saw the man and the woman walking along in the direction of the vehicle with the handcuffed woman in front of the man and close together. “All her husband, who was driving, was able to see or recall of the scene was a stationary white-coloured vehicle with its lights flashing. “They were in fact witnessing the kidnap of Sarah Everard. She was detained by fraud.

Susan Everard made the upsetting admission while delivering an intense victim impact statement at the Old Bailey today. Speaking alongside daughter Katie and husband Jeremy, Susan spoke directly at former police officer Wayne Couzens, who was being sentenced for murdering the -year-old. In the morning I wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Donapost get in the car, Sarah. Donapost believe him. Run! she told the court. I am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah.  I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted. Sarah wanted to get married and have children, now all that has gone. He took her le and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think, Sarah should be here, leading her le and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her. The Old Bailey heard how Couzens, , abused Covid- lockdown regulations to kidnap Sarah in a fake arrest then rape and strangle her. He used his politan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to snatch Sarah as she walked home from a friendaposs house in Clapham, south London, on the evening of March .  The firearms officer, who had clocked off from a -hour sht at the American embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover in Kent, where he parked up and raped Sarah. The marketing executive, who lived in Brixton, south London, had been strangled with Couzenaposs police belt by .am the following morning. Married Couzens burned her body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, Kent, before dumping the remains in a nearby pond. Just days later, amid extensive publicity about Sarahaposs disappearance, he took his family on a day out to the woods, allowing his two children to play close by. Couzens concocted a story about being threatened by a gang when he was arrested at his Deal home on March  but later pleaded guilty to her kidnap, rape and murder.  Today, as he sat quaking in the dock with his head bowed at the start of his sentencing, Sarahaposs dad Jeremy demanded the killer look at him. He said: I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us. Susan said she was incandescent with rage at what he had done, saying he disposed of her daughter asshe was rubbish. Sister Katie wept as she said: My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasnapost aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon her and raped her. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick also attended court to hear how one of her own officers had abused his position and used his warrant card to kidnap Sarah by fraud before detaining her by force. Prosecutor Tom Little QC suggested the case was so exceptional and unprecedented that it could warrant a whole le order, meaning Couzens would die in jail.  Opening the facts of the case, he said Sarahaposs disappearance was one of the most widely publicised missing person investigations the country has ever seen. After her body was discovered a week later, it became summarised on social media by the hashtag she was just walking home, which did not completely describe what had happened, he said. Whilst it is impossible to summarise what the defendant did to Sarah Everard in just five words,it had to be done then it would be more appropriate to do so as deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire, said Mr Little. The court heard Sarah was described by a former long-term boyfriend as extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise and not a gullible person. He said he could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know unless by force or manipulation, said the prosecutor.Couzens had worked on unormed Covid patrols in late January to enforce coronavirus regulations, so would have known what language to use to those who may have breached them, he continued. He is thought to have been wearing his police belt with handcuffs and a rectangular black pouch, similar to a pepper spray holder, when he kidnapped Sarah as she walked home. The fact she had been to a friendaposs house for dinner at the height of the early  lockdown made her more vulnerable to and more likely to submit to an accusation that she had acted in breach of the Covid regulations in some way, said Mr Little. The court heard how Couzens had booked a hire car before going out hunting for a lone young female to kidnap and rape. Chilling CCTV footage played in court showed Couzens raising his left arm, holding a warrant card, before handcuffing Sarah and putting her into the back of the car. A passing couple witnessed the kidnapping but mistook it for an arrest by an undercover officer, the court heard.  Mr Little said: She was detained by fraud. The defendant using his warrant card and handcuffs as well as his other police issue equipment to effect a  arrest. Couzens worked for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command after joining the Met in , having transferred from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. He was sacked by the force after entering guilty pleas. Scotland Yard said in a statement ahead of the sentencing hearing: We are sickened, angered and devastated by this manaposs crimes which betray everything we stand for. Lord Justice Fulford adjourned the case until Thursday when he will hand down his sentence.

Wind farm rigger Neil Stewart, from Benwell, drowned in the North Sea Canal in November , after a night out on a party boat. Neil, , had been visiting the city on a surprise trip organised by fiancée Cha Dixon. Earlier this week, Newcastle Coroner’s Court heard from Neilaposs colleague Paul Armes, who had wanted to try to help his friend but had been prevented from entering the water.Newcastle Coroner Karen Dilks also heard from one witness who said that Neil had come out of nowhere in the smoking area to punch her friend in the face, Chronicle Live reports. But on Wednesday afternoon, the court heard from surprise witness Angelica Hindle, who had come forward after reading media reports of the inquest. Angelica, from Cheshire, had been aboard the boat at the time of Neil’s death. She told the inquest she had heard an “altercation” near the DJ’s stand, which she had recorded on video while trying to film people dancing, before Neil was led out of the area. She said: I couldnapost make out exactly what was being said but I could hear people raising their voices and people responding to it. Five or ten minutes later, she witnessed the father-of-two’s tragic fall into the water. She said: “Me and my friend were sat smoking. I looked to my left-hand side and there was a man that I now know to be Neil sat there. There was a security guard sat with him. “Neil was sat, he was calm, and the security guard turned around for a split second. As he did that, Neil ed over the side of the boat and then he hit the water and the boat propelled him back because it was going at such a speed.”  The evidence of a previous altercation provided some answers to the family as it helped them understand the incident in the smoking area. Mum Alma Stewart told the witness: Neilaposs children will now know... how their father died thanks to you and I cannot thank you enough, it means so so much to me personally. Addressing the inquest, Alma described the horror of the two-week wait in Amsterdam as police searched for the body of her special boy, and how she had at first hoped he might be found alive. His body was discovered by Dutch police, she said, in a spot on the shore where Alma had stood while the search went on. Alma said: My boy had come back to me, he found a way and came back to me. After all the technology involved in the search his body had washed up by itself. She described Neil as a very popular man who was devoted to his two children. She said: Neil was my special boy, my complex, moody, challenging son with a heart of pure gold. The void left behind in our lives can never be filled. She said she continued to hold many questions about her sonaposs death and whether anything could have been done dferently to prevent it. The court also heard from Martin Tomlinson, of Bounce Till I Dieevents, which had organised the night on the party boat. He told the court that staffing, security and alcohol licences were handled by the Dutch company which operated the boat, while his team provided extra staff to help out. He said he had told the captain to stop the boat as soon as he learnt someone was in the water and that people had searched the water with torches, but that the speed of the boat meant Neil was likely to already be far behind. He said Paul Armes had not been allowed to enter the water for safety reasons as he was intoxicated, and it had not been safe for others on the boat to go into the canal in a bid to help Neil. He said: It was cold water, it was dark, we couldnapost see anything. It was grim, it was traumatic for everybody, it really was. The inquest is set to conclude on Thursday.

The three-year-old was repeatedly bitten by another child at Sunflowers Too Day Nursery in Hessle, his mother has claimed.The assault began within weeks of his enrolment last January, the parent who asked to remain anonymous told Hull Daily Mail. A number of injuries were catalogued over the coming months, some of which were caused by the boy. When the mum complained, the other child was removed from the room her son was taught in.  But after the most recent summer holidays they were put back in the pre-school room together without the motheraposs knowledge. It was only when her son came home from nursery with another bite mark and told her the not nice boy had done it, that she found out they were together again. After complaining to the manager she given a dayaposs notice to remove her child from the nursery after being told her contract has been terminated.  She claims: My child has been bitten several times at nursery. He tells me this boy is not very nice to him and he upsets him. I had a meeting last year and the child was removed from the same room.@ She claims he aposgot another bite this weekapos and added that aposhe told me whoaposd done it, and thank goodness he can talk as otherwise I wouldnapost have known he was in the same room as this child, as nursery didnapost tell me.  I emailed my concerns and I was very upset but I wasnapost rude. I got a reply to say she was terminating our contract and I asked for a meeting and she repeated that she was terminating the contract. She claims that because aposthey canapost keep my son safe he is getting kicked out of nursery.apos The mum, who is studying to become a teacher, said she has complained to Ofsted and is now having to keep her son at home until a suitable alternative nursery can be found. This manager is excluding my child from their friends and education, I had raised serious safeguarding concerns.  I have taken advice about the matter and was told thatI have legitimate concerns as a parent and have raised them, they should be looking into these instead of terminating my contract. I am disgusted that instead of addressing the injuries my son has received they are throwing him out of nursery. I have rightfully reported the matter to Ofsted as they have no grounds to rip my son away from his friends and education, she claimed.In an email to the parent, the nursery wrote: On reflection and having taken advice with regard to your concerns about the careis receiving at Sunflowers Too Day Nursery, we have an untenable situation where everything is being questioned and you feel your child is not safe here despite us doing the utmost for allchildren.I feel the parent-carer relationship has irretrievably broken down and I am therefore, terminating our contract. There is a four week notice period, however as you are so disappointed in the service we are providing and absolutely disgusted with my staff, this can be waived. A spokesman for the nursery said: Sunflowers Too Day Nursery have followed all policies and procedures under the Early Years Foundation Stage and safeguarding requirements. We are in communication with Ofsted who are our regulatory body and we have informed them all policies and procedures followed are to keep all our children safe at Sunflowers Too Day Nursery.

Scientists say they relate to two new species of spinosaurid, a group of predatory theropod dinosaurs closely related to the giant Spinosaurus, StaffordshireLive reports.The first specimen has been named Ceratosuchops inferodios , which translates as the “horned, crocodile-faced hell heron”.With a series of low horns and bumps on the brow region, its hunting stye has been likened by scientists to a fearsome version of the modern-day bird. Herons famously catch aquatic prey around the margins of waterways, but their diet is far more flexible than is generally appreciated and can include terrestrial prey too. The second dinosaur was named Riparovenator milnerae , which translates as “Milner’s riverbank hunter”, in honour of British palaeontologist Angela Milner, who died recently.The haul of bones was discovered on a beach near Brighstone over a period of several years. In all, more than  bones from the site have been uncovered from rocks that form part of the Wessex Formation, laid down more than  million years ago during the Early Cretaceous period. The only spinosaurid skeleton previously unearthed in the UK belonged to Baryonyx, which was initially discovered in  in a quarry in Surrey. Most other finds since have been restricted to isolated teeth and single bones.  One expert hailed the discovery of the two specimens in quick succession as a “huge surprise”, but said palaeontologists had suspected for decades that the remains of such dinosaurs could be found on the island. Darren Naish, an expert in British theropod dinosaurs, said the discovery of spinosaurid dinosaurs on the Isle of Wight was a long time coming. “We’ve known for a couple of decades now that Baryonyx-like dinosaurs awaited discovered on the Isle of Wight, but finding the remains of two such animals in close succession was a huge surprise, he said. Analysis of the Isle of Wight bones carried out at the University of Southampton and published in the Scientic Reports journal suggested they belonged to species of dinosaurs previously unknown to science. Dr Neil J Gostling of the University of Southampton, who supervised the project, said: “This work has brought together universities, the Dinosaur Isle museum and the public to reveal these amazing dinosaurs and the incredibly erse ecology of the south coast of England  million years ago.”  Chris Barker, a PhD student at the University of Southampton and lead author of the study, said: “We found the skulls to dfer not only from Baryonyx, but also one another, suggesting the UK housed a greater ersity of spinosaurids than previously thought.” The Early Cretaceous rocks on the Isle of Wight describe an ancient floodplain environment bathed in a Mediterranean-like climate. Whilst generally balmy, forest fires occasionally ravaged the landscape, and the remains of burnt wood can be seen throughout the clfs today. With a large river and other bodies of water-attracting dinosaurs and housing ious fish, sharks and crocodiles, the habitat will have provided the newly discovered spinosaurids with plenty of hunting opportunities. The new fossils will go on display at the Dinosaur Isle museum in Sandown on the Isle of Wight.

After a relative respite on Wednesday that saw sunnier skies the country will once again see widespread rain on Thursday and temperatures are forecast to stay low. Forecasters said the coming deluge will strike much of the UK, with the heaviest downpours in the west, while the far southeast will dodge much of the rain until later.  It will also be another windy day with coastal gales forecast for the south east and temperatures are likely to stay in the low to mid teens for many areas throughout the day. And longer range forecasts predict the washout weather will continue over the coming days and into the weekend. By the weekend the nation is expected to see strong winds of up to mph and relentless rainfall that could see mm of rainfall an hour in some regions. Dan Stroud, Operational Meteorologist from the Met Office, told the Express the weekend will bring “persistent and at times heavy rain likely to move northeast across the UK.”He said: “Winds strengthening in the south and east late Saturday afternoon and evening with coastal gales, gusting to -mph along the south coast in places. “The area of organised cloud and rain, locally heavy is expected to clear north and east on Sunday but may persists across the far northeast of Scotland for much of the day were it will remain windy for much of the day, again with coastal gales. UK Weather Forecast Today: Outbreaks of rain affecting many areas, though far southeast England probably staying dry until later. Some bright spells possible, mainly east of hills. A little warmer than Wednesday despite being windy. Tonight: Mostly cloudy with outbreaks of rain continuing, heavy at times in the west, although some clear spells are possible across northeast Scotland. Rather windy with coastal gales in the southeast. Friday: Cloud and rain, locally heavy, clearing east. Mixture of sunshine and showers following, locally heavy with hail and thunder in the northwest. Feeling cooler with coastal gales at times.

The -year-old married father-of-two, from Deal in Kent, abducted Ms Everard in a hire car as she walked home in south London on the evening of March . The sexual predator, who had clocked off from a -hour sht that morning, went on to rape and strangle the -year-old marketing executive then set fire to her body. At pm on the night of Ms Everardaposs disappearance he was caught on CCTV at a Tesco Superstore in Kensington, west London, buying a pack of  hair bands, which were said to be a apossignicantapos purchase and part of his plans. He strangled the -year-old with his police belt at or before .am the following morning. On March , at .am, Couzens was seen buying a petrol canister and filling it up at a BP forecourt in Whitfield, Dover.In the days that followed he was caught on CCTV buying two green rubble bags at a BQ in Dover. He went on to order tarpaulin and a bungee cargo net from Amazon on March , which were shipped with next day delivery. A week after she disappeared, Ms Everardaposs remains were found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. Today at the Old Bailey Ms Everardaposs mum Susan said that Couzens treated my daughter asshe was nothing and disposed of her asshe was rubbish.  The court heard that Couzens had finished a -hour sht with the politan Police before he picked up the hire car which he used to kidnap Ms Everard under the guise of arresting her for breaking lockdown rules. During his five daysapos leave, he told his work supervisor that he felt unable to carry firearms and felt stressed over a pay dispute. Police identied Couzens through the hire car and quickly established he was a serving police officer. Prosecutor Tom Little QC described her as the victim of “deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire”. Mr Little told the court Couzens had worked on ‘Covid patrols’ in the weeks before the murder.  Detectives believe the off-duty cops used the pandemic as an excuse to ‘detain’ his victim as she walked along the street. He spent weeks planning the crime and booked a hire car to use in the kidnap three days before abducting Ms Everard. Married dad-of-two Couzens spent hours driving around west and south London before targeting his victim. Dash-cam footage showed Couzens’s rented white and black Vauxhall Crossland pulled up, with its hazard lights on, on the pavement next to his victim.  Mr Little said: “Sarah Everard is standing on the pavement, behind the car, facing the defendant who is a few feet away. “The defendant appears to touch his belt and to be holding up his hand towards Sarah Everard, asshowing her something in it. “A couple were travelling on the south circulate in their car to their home address in south-east London and witnessed the kidnap of Sarah Everard.  “The front seat passenger noticed what she described as a man and a woman standing on the pavement with the man behind the woman. “The man was wearing dark clothing and she started to watch more closely because she saw a handcuff. “The woman on the pavement already had her left arm behind her back. “She was in the process of “giving her other arm behind her back” as the man, who must have been the defendant, placed the handcuff on her right arm. “She was compliant, with her head down and did not appear to be arguing. The defendant appeared to be confident.  “The immediate impression the passenger formed was that she was witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman, whom she assumed “must have done something wrong”. The former Met Police officer then raped and strangled the marketing executive after driving her  miles to Kent. He eventually burned her body and dumped it in a builder’s bag in a woodland stream near land he owned in Ashford, Kent. Couzens was arrested at his marital home in Deal, Kent, six days after Everard’s disappearance. Police had tracked his rental car, which he booked under his own name three days before the murder. The hearing continues.

Our winners will now each get to advertise what they do in our titles and install £ worth of Square hardware in their businesses. Below each of them reveals how the win will help transform their businesses... aposWe’re used to winning gin-tasting competitions - but this was out of the blue!apos - York Gins, York The team at York Gin canapost wait to get to grips with their new Square hardware and say it will help them maximise their sales at outdoor events. York Gins is owned and run by Emma Goala, , Pete McNichol, , Paul Crossman, , and -year-old Harry Cooke. Speaking to us following the good news, they said: We’re absolutely delighted to win the prize. As a small business in these very strange and uncertain times, any help we can get is very welcome. We couldn’t quite believe we’d won when we were contacted! We’re pretty used to winning gin-tasting competitions - but this was out of the blue. We think our business is special because we put people, the planet and fun at the very heart of everything we do. We pay the Living Wage and make sure everyone is fully trained and gets any outside training they may need. York Gin only launched in  but has also grown rapidly. The team added: When we started, two of us were working in a cold former chicken shed, making the gin and bottling, labelling and packing everything by hand. We had a good hunch that the local market would provide some demand for a locally-made gin - in fact one of our directors, Paul, is a pub landlord, so we thought at least we’ll have one customer!The team are looking forward to using the new Square Stand Kit, adding: We are always interested in trying new solutions to tricky problems like payments. The loyalty programme Square offers looks particularly interesting.We have plans to grow - but in a controlled and sustainable manner. We have plans to open a second shop in York. We already have a shop in the historic centre right opposite the famous Shambles and now plan a new shop in the city’s train station. We have ambitions to grow our online store too which Square could help us with. Squareaposs POS technology in particular is very flexible for our outdoor events - which are key now we are all doing things outdoors even more! It will make such a dference having technology with the ability to grow with us - Clueit Webb Interiors, Margate Ollie Clueit, , has been surrounded by collectables and antiques as long as he can remember, whether in his family home or at the boot sales and antique fairs his parentsdragged him to. But over the years his parentaposs passion developed into his own love of all things antique and vintage, and three years ago, Ollie left his career in the music industry, retrained as an upholsterer and moved to Margate, where he operated Recovered by Ollie from a  foot shipping container. The business has come a long way since then, claiming a  square foot workshop and a shop space, but it’s during the next exciting phase that the Square technology will be invaluable. Last year, Corinne Webb, , came on board to help Ollie with his workload, brining with her a wealth of experience in textiles and interior design, and the pair quickly realised they made a fantastic team, and decided to go into partnership together to expand and rebrand as Clueit Webb Interiors.  “We are going to be adding extra products to the website and physical shop,” said the duo. “The Square kit will really help us keep track of stock and give us a real understanding of what is selling and what isnapost, and help us decide what we should be restocking. “Plus, the fact that it links up to our accounting software and keeps track of sales on social media will be beyond helpful.” Having combined their years of experience in upholstery, vintage furniture sourcing, textiles and interior design, Ollie and Corinne are able to offer unique and exciting services and products to clients nationally, as well as in the south east. “We have a hands-on approach, working really closely with clients,” they explain. “We have a passion for restoring peopleaposs furniture and helping them craft homes that are a true reflection of our clientsapos tastes.”  With that in mind, Ollie and Corinne are looking to open a larger shop space, take on additional staff and signicantly expand their online presence. And the ability to upgrade the Square software and expand the Square services will make the management of these additional areas so much easier. “We are delighted to win this prize,” they told us. “Our previous POS was very basic and offered no integration with our online store and accounting software, so it will make such a dference having technology with the ability to grow with us.” aposWeaposre over the moon - Square’s architecture is easily scalableapos - Outdoor Fire Pits, Nottinghamshire Husband and we duo Tony and Kate Cox set up their business in  on the eve of Tonyaposs th and say winning our Square bundle will help them continue to grow. The business manufactures beautul, sturdy, steel outdoor fire pits and other steel items for the home and garden. Reacting to winning our prize, Tony said: Weaposre over the moon to have won.  Weaposre on the brink of taking on some staff to run our retail shop, which would mean investing in some permanent payment taking hardware, as to date, we’ve each had a card reader paired with our phone. The Square Register will give us that permanent asset which anyone who runs the shop can use without needing an app on their phone. Secondly, we’ve seen an increase in the number of people who ask to order and pay by phone, which is something missing from our current offering, which will be resolved by Square. Tony and Kateaposs business is booming and has come a long way in a short amount of time. Tony added: Five years ago, we started manufacturing in a tiny  square foot rented barn building, with a lot of time spent on design and selling a couple units per month. We then doubled the size of our space. During the  lockdown to keep up with growth, we successfully partnered with some local welding schools and have now negotiated new partnerships which have given us the capacity to supply a number of garden centres in addition to our own direct sales. We do plan to grow and it’s satisfying to know Square’s architecture is easily scalable, no matter where we go and no matter how fast we get there.

With the crisis now in its sixth day there have been debate over whether keyworkers should get priority access to fuel at petrol stations to keep emergency vehicles operational. A number of petrol stations across the country have even put signs allowing key workers such as ambulance staff to jump the queue.Emma Vogelmann, who lives on the outskirts of Hertfordshire near Royston, says she is concerned with the panic buying as he le depends on carers being able to visit her. The lead policy adviser for the disability charity Scope requires round-the-clock care due to her condition, reported HertsLive. Emma has spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic condition that makes the muscles weaker and causes problems with movement. She also has complications caused by Swine Flu - when she contracted the virus in  it left her needing a ventilator, which helps her to breathe via a tracheotomy. Emma often requires people to manage her airways to assist with breathing and swallowing, so it is vital that her carers can get to her.Some of her team have to travel upwards of  minutes to get to her home, which was an issue on Monday when one of her carers said she might not be able to make it due to being low on petrol.Emma said: “I got a message from my carer on Monday saying she wouldn’t be able to get to meshe couldn’t get petrol. “It was a real stress for me and for her, she was really low and couldn’t find fuel anywhere.” Luckily, she was able to get the help she required because her carer got access to some fuel. Without them, however, she would have to rely on her mum who works as a GP in AE. For Emma, it is an ongoing worry whilst the crisis continues and she thinks that priority should be given to those who require it most. I think that we should be prioritising the people who absolutely cannot work from home, she said. “It leaves disabled people in a dangerous position. “All the people given priority to access the supermarkets during the pandemic should be given to those same people for petrol until the shortage is resolved. She hopes that those who are buying fuel for the sake of it begin to understand that there are people who rely on petrol to survive. She said: At the moment I don’t have anyone telling me they are low on fuel but it is something I am hyper-aware of. “If you’re thinking about filling up because you’re worried about getting any petrol I just want people to think for a moment, do they really need it  “Think about how,you fill up when you donapost really need it, it could have an impact on someone whose le depends on it. “So really just think before you act.” Comment MORE ON Swine fluFluDisabilityPanic-buying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The replies include: “We can’t keep the water on all the time, especially with this economy”, while another says: “People steal the sea and we steal it back in the morning”. Another viewer wrote: “It’s European sea, it voted to leave” while someone  said: “We have a timeshare arrangement with France.” But one user, seemingly without irony, comments: “Wait, is this not a thing in other countries ! ! Genuinely thought that’s just what the sea did everywhere.” Carmela replies: “I’ve NEVER seen a boat propped up like that, mate.

been honoured in recongition of their volunteer work amidst the Covid- pandemic.Members of Westhill and District Men’s Shed have become the worthy recipients of the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Servicein recognition of the outstanding contribution made by their volunteers to benefit the community of Westhill and surrounding area.The Aberdeenshire group was the first men#s shed to be created across Scotland and has garnered more than  members.Chairman David Thomson said: “It is an honour and a privilege to receive this prestigious award on behalf of our  members of the Westhill Men’s Shed.#The award recognises the contribution made by our members, who are all volunteers, in supporting the local and wider community.#It also recognises that attending the Shed and participating in the wide range of activities available is an important contributor to our members’ health and wellbeing.”During a brief gathering on Monday, Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire, Alexander Philip Manson presented the group with their crystal award, certicate and pin badges before taking a tour of their facilities.The award also featured special recognition for the Covid- work carried out by the members.In the early days of lockdown, the shed was made aware of the grave shortages in personal protective equipmentfor their local care homes when Shed secretary and founding member, Nick Pilbeam, was visiting a Shed member, who has since died.Mr Pilbeam said it was humbling to see the work of their volunteers recognised in such a prestigious manner.“Shed members did some research and learned that face shields could be made simply with a D printer and an A sheet of acetate,# he said.#A project team was quickly set up to tackle the issue using our Shed printer however we soon realised that the volume needed to be increased quickly and therefore recruited over  iniduals, some with D printers in their own homes.#A small army of face shield preppers and other volunteers joined forces to co-ordinate the production and distribution of almost , face visors and we are delighted to have their work also recognised through the award.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

highlight the best things to see and do in the Moray town.It will cover everything from restaurants and visitor attractions to the areas most plagued by pesky midges.The app, which has been supported by Visit Moray Speyside, will also feature a full list of the dferent accommodation available in the Forres.Not only is the app free to use and download, it#s also free for businesses to list their services and details.The app is linked to the Visit Forres website, run by Moray Media CIC.Marc Hindley, managing director of Moray Media CIC, spoke of how the app is aimed at both visitors and those who live in and around Forres.He said: #Forres has a lot to offer, and this is our attempt to bring it all into one place, so people that come here don’t miss anything, or stay longer. And for people that live here, who still miss some of the things that are going on right on their doorstep.#Mr Hindley also said the new app will be perfect for those trying to access information about Forres on the go: #Apps really drive focus, and while we have built a comprehensive website, having the information in your hand makes it so much more accessible than searching for information each time you need it.#We‘ve tried to think of all the information people would need for a day out in the country, a night on the tiles, or a week’s holiday, and we’ll keep adding to it as necessary.#It tries to encompass any information someone visiting the area might want to know, including the locations of more practical services like public toilets and car charging points.Moray Media CIC is also keen for people to get in touchthey feel there is any information missing from the app.Mr Hindley said it will constantly grow and evolve: #We want people to get in touchthey think something should be added.#It’s not a snapshot of , we want it to see it grow and develop, and be part of the leisure landscape.#It is thought that the Visit Forres app is the only one of its kind in Moray, which Mr Hindley believes will give businesses in Forres an advantage.He explained: #Although our organisation’s focus is mainly the Forres area, we believe this is the only tourism app of its kind in Moray, and so it makes our corner of the Moray Speyside region that little bit more visible, which of course is great news for the businesses who are listed.#Our social ethos is to build collaborative publicity s that not only benefit consumers, but also help businesses, organisations and event managers reach the widest possible audience.#Laurie Piper, chief executive of Visit Moray Speyside, also praised the app for its focus on building up local businesses.He said: #The new Visit Forres app is a great addition for both visitors and locals, looking for relevant, local information.#It’s another good example of the growing energy in communities around rebuilding tourism and encouraging locally-focused initiatives.#The app has been launched and is available to download on Apple and Android.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

forward as one of the key possible options to save a #cherished# Aberdeen park from industrial development.Torry residents have joined forces to try and take charge of St Fittick#s Park#s future, and preserve and enhance their #last green space# for community benefit.The wetlands in south-east Aberdeen have been a hotly discussed matter since last year, when the area was earmarked for an energy transition zone within the council’s new local development plan.The site # along with Doonie’s Rare Breeds Farm # was identied as a prime location for the energy scheme given its proximity to the new £ million south harbour.However, members of the local community and politicians have perpetually voiced their opposition to flattening the park, claiming the proposal is #a slap in the face for the people of Torry#.Over the weekend, dozens of locals gathered at St Fittick#s Park to share ideas on how to protect the park for future generations and improve it to suit the community needs.Participants in the Torry People#s Assembly unanimously backed proposals to take ownership of the parkneeded to prevent yet another #unwanted# development being imposed on the local community.Co-organiser of the event, Scott Herrett, said: #There is a desire for the park to be protected in perpetuity and that’s where the idea for asset transfer was brought up as key.#What came up as a main point is they need more information what an asset transfer involves, but they like the idea of the community being in control and having the power to decide what goes or doesn’t go in the park.#The local people understand that there is a need for an energy transition zone in the north-east, but obviously not at the detriment of a cherished local green space, which has provided a lot of benefits to people, especially in the last  months.#For me, that shows complete detachment from the community by the city council, and also a lack of imagination and consultation.#According to the Community Empowerment Act, communities have the right to request ownership for any land or building from local authoritiesthey feel they can make better use of it.A range of options on potential improvements to the park were discussed and presented at the assembly # including converting the land into a natural reserve and building an outdoor learning centre or a community hub.Other suggestions were to keep St Fittick#s Park as it is, or allow the construction of small-scale development at the site # such as a cafe or toilets # to make it more accessible.Emma Jeal, who attended the event with her one-year-old son Isaac, said any further enhancement to the park is welcome as long as it remains an open green space for the public.The -year-old said: #Torry’s got a lot of issues and it’s not fair to give it another one.#If we have to give examples of ways we can make it better, in contrast to what others are suggesting, to prove we use the land well – then fair enough, we’ll stick all bells and whistles on it.#It’s an amazing space and it’s right on my doorstep, and there are alternative sites for it. So why is this even being suggested, when it’s so good for the local people and wildle.#Things always seem to be happening to Torry, rather than with Torry. Somehow they don’t seem interested in us or what we need at all – they just want to build on us.#mdash Friends of St Fittick#s ParkSeptember , Another resident, -year-old Simon McLead, who has lived in Torry since , added there are other options to be explored.He said: #It shouldn’t be concreted over, simple as.#Much of it can be retained as it is, and possibly we can look into the feasibility of having a wind turbine or something similar so we can actually be more environmentally friendly and bring some money back to the local community.#Communities want change, but they want that change to represent them and not just limited business interests.#The major development is part of long-term plans to sht the economy away from a reliance on oil and gas.The new centre is expected to support around , #green# jobs by , along with another , related jobs.However, residents and politicians have raised concerns over the #actual benefits# it will bring to Torry and whether these jobs will be sustainable for local people.The #lack of engagement and consultation# over the proposals has also accelerated the existing tension, with locals claiming there is a greater need for #transparency and communication#.But Aberdeen City Council has previously reassured thatan official planning application is lodged, #the community will be able to fully engage with that process prior to any decision being taken#.Green MSP Maggie Chapman, who has backed campaigners from the start, insisted people need to be included in all discussions and represented in the right manner.She said: #So often, community voices are marginalised and ignored,they are heard at all, and we have an opportunity to do something dferent here – to redress the power imbalance in our planning and democratic system.#We also need to look at the inequality and the neglect that Torry has faced for decades – from the council and the government # it’s just been forgotten.#It’s about how we can make it better as a community space – keep the green space and the wetlands, allow the bioersity to develop and grow, and make it more accessible and usable for people.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of

recover to pre-pandemic levels earlier than previously thought but economists are warning of disruption over winter caused by inflation, supply chain shortages and a possible spike in unemployment.The Fraser of Allander Institutehas reported strong economic growth in the second quarter of  but said there are signicant risks that could see the recovery “flatten off or even go into reverse”.The Strathclyde University research institute now forecasts economic growth of .% in  and .% in , with the economy ing to pre-pandemic levels by April next year – three months earlier than expected.Its prediction echoes Scottish Fiscal Commission forecasts that the Scottish economy will grow by .% in the - financial year, fuelled by greater household spending.But both organisations have warned that domestic recruitment dficulties and pressure on international supply chains are pushing the inflation rate upwards.In its economic commentary, sponsored by accountancy firm Deloitte, the FAI suggests growth could stallconsumer spending is hit by inflation, more shortages or the damage caused by furlough ending on Friday.Further uncertainty from the planned cancellation of the Universal Credit uplt next month is expected to bring additional financial hardship to around half a million families in Scotland, while labour shortages in numerous sectors increase the threat of increased shortages of goods and add to the risk of more inflation, it adds.Mairi Spowage, director of the FAI, said: “Following a stronger recovery in economic activity than we were expecting during May and June, and the further easing of restrictions during the summer, we have revised up our outlook for growth.“However, there are several reasons that growth could stall.“If new public health restrictions need to be imposed, orthe end of the furlough scheme and the Universal Credit uplt lead to an easing off in consumer spending, or supply chain disruption and shortages continue, the recovery could flatten off or even go into reverse.”Steve Williams, senior partner at Deloitte in Scotland, said: “While the economy is still feeling the impact of the pandemic, after the initial bounce its recovery has certainly moved into a new phase one marked by slower, more constrained growth and higher inflation.“Although it is likely that the global recovery will continue, the situation remains fluid, particularly as government support winds down, and as supply chain issues continue, presenting a risk to growth.”Looking ahead to the Cop conference, the FAI suggests that the current policies are not enough to effectively tackle the climate crisis.Ms Spowage said: “Few of the Government’s environmental measures are showing the progress that is likely to be needed to achieve long-term environmental outcomes.“This adds to the fact that almost half of businesses have not set a target to get to net zero.“It is clear that a real step change in ambition is required in order to achieve Scotland’s world-leading targets. The world waits to see what will be achieved in Glasgow in November.”Mr Williams said: “With greater focus than ever on the climate crisis, businesses must look at the associated opportunities and risks that come with this. Ultimately, a bold, entrepreneurial approach will need to be taken by business leaders, who will have to employ creativity and innovation at scale.“This will be supported by new ways of living, working and consumption, all of which will be required for the growth of a greener economy as we recover and thrive following the pandemic.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/09/SCOTLAND_40818907-559x372.jpg ","title":"tories should have paused brexit the same way i paused independence vote claims nicola sturgeon","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remFuel shortages and empty supermarket shelves could have been prevented had the Conservative government “paused Brexit” the way Nicola Sturgeon “paused” a second independence referendum, the First Minister has claimed.Ms Sturgeon warned Christmas could be disrupted because of HGV driver shortages and the general labour market woes brought about by Brexit.If Brexit had been stopped during the peak of the Covid pandemic, she said, then the “anxiety and nervousness” felt by consumers would be lessened and the current labour shortage prevented.The Scottish Conservatives criticised the first minister’s comments and claimed she and her party had “never once” paused their campaign for another “isive” referendum.Ms Sturgeon was speaking at an event to mark the announcement of , jobs for Social Security Scotland, the “bulk of which” will be in Dundee, where she admitted taking responsibility of benefits had taken longer than #wanted#.When askedthe fuel shortages experienced over the weekend should be described as a crisis, Ms Sturgeon said: #This has not been caused by a fundamental shortage of fuel, it is being caused by the disruption to the labour market of Brexit, which has made it more dficult to get fuel to petrol stations and has created the anxiety and nervousness on the part of consumers.#And that is only one problem, people are seeing supermarket shelves short of certain products, again because it is really dficult to get the drivers to take these products to market.“We have fruit and vegetables unpicked because the labour isn’t there.#We are now paying the price, the UK as a whole, of a UK Government that recklessly drove through Brexit in the face of a global pandemic.#These problems are going to continue.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people.

St Peter#sSt Peter#s win - on penaltiesRed Star welcomed St Peter#s to the Ropework last Saturday for their Scottish Cup first round tie and were disappointed to exit the competition after an even contest ended - after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern. Argyll and Bute Council allowed the use of its premises.The concert was supported by Chamber Music Scotland and Creative Scotland.The next MAAA concert is on Saturday October  with Les Trois Blondes, Scotland’s only Bal Musette band, playing classical Parisian café music.Submitted.PIC:The specially-formed Royal Conservatoire of Scotland quartet #

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white

attend drop-in centres to get vaccinated over the past couple of weeks, however now everyone this age will be officially invited by letter to attend an appointment.Children and their parents must

end of furlough could leave this group who are yet toto work in limbo, with the figures unclear regarding how many people still rely on the initative for their income.But does furlough apply to Scotland, and will Scottish workers be impacted by the changes Heres what you need to know...Furlough is a UK wide initiative across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and is therefore controlled by the UK government.Scotland does not have the borrowing powers necessary to fund a scheme as vast as furlough, and so it is left in the hands of Westminster.It means that the scheme is aligned across the UK and that furlough will end in Scotland after September .Benefits and social security are not devolved powers, meaning that the UK government is in charge of Universal Credit for the entire country.This means that when the pound increase to Universal Credit ends in October, it will apply to all four nations across the UK.Some forecasters are expecting a small rise in unemployment following the end of the scheme, due to some companies being unable to keep staff on without continued support.If you are made redundant following the end of furlough, you have legal rights:the redundancy selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.Jobseekers allowance may also apply to you, which is a payment to

Thatrsquos why wersquove compiled this list, with the goal to help select the best one for you.Of course, the first thing yoursquoll notice about brand new online casinos is their design, so we want you to be prepared. Excellent navigation and user experience are essential for players at online casinos, as lagging, poor design, and other issues might heavily influence your gaming enjoyment.However, the design doesnrsquot do muchyou canrsquot find the games you are looking for at a casino. Many casinos have similar sets of games, and all of them feature titles from renowned providers. However, some of them do offer unique ones, and others have a better selection. It would be redundant to repeat them all for each operator, but giving you a hint about what each casino has in store might tip the scales to one provider or the other.For new players, bonuses often play a crucial role in deciding on their next online gambling destination. This is why wersquove felt itrsquos essential to include the bonuses that new casino sites in the UK offer their prospective players. Itrsquos not just about the new players, though - a good casino needs to have a healthy selection of generous promotions to keep veterans playing, too.Available payment methods are another consideration when deciding whether or not you will be playing at a particular casino. Some payment methods might fit you better than others, and some payment avenues are definitely safer and quicker than others. Thatrsquos why having a wide selection is always preferable.Lastly, good customer support is as important as anything  on the list. A good casino must make getting in touch with customer support as simple as possible. All of the new UK casino sites on our list have excellent customer support agents. It is good to know which options you have for getting in touch with the support team at a particular casino, even before the need to contact them arises.FAQ:Which is the best new online casino in the UK Many casinos are tied for this title, and the winner depends entirely on you and your preferences.

Its behaviours are entirely driven by one single issue to the detriment of all others and indeed of the Scottish people it purportedly represents.

The UK media is awash with debate over the relative merits of two spin-offs from the original Ukip, one labelled as Conservative and the other as Labour. Leading figures in both these parties are united in their assertions that the supply chain tanker driver shambles is not attributable in any signicant way to the Brexit madness which was inflicted on Scotland by xenophobic neighbours south of the Border. Our right-wing media is complicit in promoting this whitewashing of the predictable consequences of the ending of freedom of movement.The Scottish nation needs to shake off any feelings of guilt about addressing our democratic deficit while Covid is still among us. Constitutional questions should not be set aside any more than health, jobs, education or travel. The need to assert our right to take control of our nations destiny has never been more urgent.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.LEVELLING UP WAS TRIED AND IT FAILEDANDREW Dunlopdevastatingly points out that ldquothe UK is one of the most economically unbalanced countries in the industrialised world. He adds that ndash incredibly ndash disposable incomes in north-east England, Wales and Northern Ireland are more than % lower than in London. He quotes the NIESR study stating that half of the UK population live in regions ldquowhose productivity is no better than the poorer parts of former East Germany.This unequal UK situation is the reason why Scotland is moving towards independence. The ldquoDrt South began  years ago, as heavy industry faded in Scotland and northern England. The Conservatives under Alec Douglas-Home tried levelling up. They brought car industries to Bathgate and Linwood and steel to Ravenscraig. All now ldquono more. Harold Wilsonrsquos Labour UK governments likewise tried regional policies, barring industries from south-east England. This also collapsed as Margaret Thatcher ed to an economic free-for-all.Independence is the clear solution for Scotland. Lord Dunlop should be pointing out that the three countries around Scotland ndash Ireland, Norway and Iceland ndash have all doubled their populations since becoming independent, despite all being on the outer edge of Europe. Scotland, as a peripheral UK region, has had a largely static population since . Like some Hebridean island, Scotland has a disproportionately high older population and a serious shortage of young people. Ireland, in sharp contrast, has one of Europersquos youngest populations.Given this grand sweep of reality, Lord Dunloprsquos ldquosolution of transferring powers from Holyrood to local government is simply pathetic. Levelling up was tried and it failed  years ago.Tom Johnston, Cumbernauld.THE UK WOULD CEASE TO EXISTPETER A Russells comment that leaving the UK would be even riskier than leaving the EUis misleading for two reasons.The first reason is that the EU is a voluntary alliance between a number of independent, sovereign countries, each of which has the democratic option of leaving the organisationthey so wish. That is not the case with Scotland in the UK.The second reason is that it seems likely that the restoration of Scotlands independence would require the cancellation of the Treaty of Union which created the UK. Wales and Northern Ireland are in a union with the UK not with England, so the dissolution of the UK would result in these countries being in a union with a non-existent political entity. Despite the incessant use of the phrase \"leaving the UK\", the UK would effectively cease to existScotland became independent again.Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh.A WISH FOR CHRISTMASALL I want for Christmas is not to have to spend it in a freezing cold garden, as happened last year. However, while it looks as though the turkeys will dodge a bullet, it does seem likely that everyone  will be served cold turkey or no turkey at all. And can Santa drive a lorry  If not, it appears our merry Christmas may depend on the seasonal goodwill of European lorry drivers, who of course will be kicked back across the Channel on December , in appreciation of the true meaning of a Brexit Christmas.At least well still have Jesus, Mary and Joseph and the wee donkey. Thank God for that.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOT WORTHY OF ANY RESPECTI REFER to Denis Bruces letterregarding Angela Rayners use of the word \"scum\".I think we all must be careful in our use of words. As Michelle Obama said, \"when they go low, we go high\". So no matter how low the Conservative Government sinks, the opposition must go higher. Ms Rayner must do her best not to lose the head and keep her vocabulary on a higher level.Mr Bruce says \"any politician worth their salt must acknowledge that political opponents have their principles\" and they deserve the dignity of respect. Unfortunately Ms Rayners opponents have shown themselves to be devoid of principles.There is no politician of any party who deserves respect for telling people who have lived in Britain all their lives and have paid their taxes to \"go home\". Nobody deserves respect for telling the Border Force to turn back desperate people in boats and put them in danger of drowning. Nobody deserves respect for taking pound of Universal Credit away from struggling families. Nobody deserves respect for cutting foreign aid to the poorest of the poor. Nobody deserves respect for making millions at a time of crisis by moving their millions from tax haven to tax haven.Personally, I would not have used the same word, but the word I would have used would have meant the same.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.PUT OUR FAITH IN THE YOUNGTHE United Nations Secretary-General Antoacutenio Guterres recently called on the world to ldquowake up, having painted a stark picture of ldquounsustainable inequalities, runaway climate change and feckless leadership.We, the people, must insist that governments go beyond fine words and take action to tackle the foregoing crises. Take, for example, Boris Johnsonrsquos climate speech to the UN General Assembly. In spite of his talk of ldquohumanity growing up and finally taking responsibility for the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves can he, given that he is the supreme example of Mr Guterresrsquos ldquofeckless leadership, be trusted to live up to his UN rhetoric However,we are unwilling to put our faith in our so-called ldquoleaders, we have our young folk in whom we can invest our hope. We must rejoice in and encourage their idealism as they take part in peaceable,passionate and noisy, protest during COP, perhaps even following their example.I was much impressed by Rosemary Goringrsquos articlewith her reference to ldquothoughtful, far-sighted people who know what they are doing, and the risks they run, and continue to do it anyway followed up with ldquofor society to be rendered voiceless and cowed is, to my mind, almost as frightening as being sent to jail.Well said, Ms Goring.John Milne, Uddingston.Read more: Whatever the risks, indy has to be better than this"},{"url":null,"title":"britney-spears-father-jamie-spears-suspended-conservatorship","story":"A judge in Los Angeles said Jamie Spears remaining in charge of his daughterrsquos money was no longer tenable.He had held the role since , when Spears, , was deemed unfit to look after herself after suffering a series of mental breakdowns.She had been pleading for her father to be ousted from the conservatorship ndash a complex legal arrangement usually reserved for the very old or infirm ndash and got her wish on Wednesday.Jamiersquos legal team had forcefully argued against his suspension, instead claiming termination of the arrangement was the correct course.However, judge Brenda Penny said after hearing from both sides, the elder Spears being suspended was in the ldquobest interests of the singer.The historic moment was celebrated wildly by members of the #FreeBritney movement who had gathered outside Los Angeles Superior Court.Spears, , was not in court while her father participated virtually and was represented by his lawyer, Vivian Thoreen.Reacting to the news on social media, Spears said she was ldquoon cloud  right now while sharing a video showing her at the controls of a plane.A hearing to discuss the termination of the conservatorship was set for November .During a heated hearing on Wednesday, Mathew S Rosengart, Spearsrsquos newly appointed lawyer, argued forcefully for Jamiersquos removal, demanding an end to the ldquoKafka-esque nightmare his client was suffering.The elder Spears remaining involved with the conservatorship was ldquotoxic and untenable, he said, and his daughter would be ldquoextraordinarily distraughthe stayed in the post.ldquoHe must be suspended today, Mr Rosengart told the court, ldquonot because a lawyer is arguing it but because Britney Spears is pleading for it.ldquoSometimes judges are asked to make very hard decisions. This is not such a decision. This is not such a case. This is a very easy decision.Mr Rosengart said the Spears estate was being run into the ground while her father was in charge and reiterated the singer would not perform again with him in control.And he alleged Jamie wanted the conservatorship wound up to avoid having his files closely examined.ldquoWhat he is afraid of is the revelation of his corruption, Mr Rosengart said.He also issued a strident defence of Calornia-based accountant Mr Zabel, who had been accused by Jamiersquos lawyers of being unqualied.The new conservator was nationally recognised and award-winning, Mr Rosengart said, especially compared to Jamie who he said had a history of gambling and alcohol issues.Mr Rosengart said it was essential the conservatorship was terminated but only in an ldquoorderly fashion. Jamiersquos immediate suspension was of paramount importance, he said.He discussed atallegations featured in a recent documentary which claimed the singer was secretly recorded in her bedroom and conversations with her two sons and boyfriend were taped.Ms Thoreen said she ldquovehemently contested the ldquounsubstantiated claims.She also defended her clientrsquos ldquoimpeccable record as conservator.He had only ever worked in his daughterrsquos best interests, the court heard, and was keen to resume contact with her.Jodi Montgomery remains conservator of Spearsrsquos personal affairs.What has been described as the worldrsquos most famous conservatorship was catapulted back into the public eye earlier this year following the release of documentary Framing Britney Spears.It explored her treatment at the hands of the paparazzi and the terms of her conservatorship.In June, Spears delivered bombshell testimony in open court, demanding the end of the ldquoabusive arrangement.Among the allegations made during a shocking -minute speech were claims she was being forced to use a contraceptive device to prevent her having more children and was unable to marry.The following month Spears ed to court and called for her father to be prosecuted for conservator abuse.It was at that hearing Mr Rosengart was appointed and promised to take a more aggressive approach to ending the conservatorship.Spears, who has sold almost  million records worldwide, remains one of the biggest stars in pop but has not performed live since .She was married to backing dancer Kevin Federline from -. He is the father of her sons Sean Preston, , and -year-old Jayden.The singer recently announced her engagement to -year-old actor and fitness expert Sam Asghari.Asghari celebrated Jamiersquos suspension on Instagram, writing: ldquoFree Britney!

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The same area has been home to a large lava lake at ious times throughout the volcanorsquos eruptive past.The eruption is not in an area with homes and is entirely contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.ldquoAll signs indicate that it will stay within the crater, said Ken Hon, the USGS scientist in charge of Hawaii Volcano Observatory.ldquoWersquore not seeing any indications that lava is moving into the lower part of the east rt zone where people live. Currently all the activity is within the park. vw,vw,px, px\"Webcam footage shows a view of an eruption that has begun in the Halemaumau crater at the summit of Hawaiirsquos Kilauea volcano The volcanorsquos alert level has been raised to ldquowarning and the aviation code changed to red.Earlier, officials said increased earthquake activity and ground swelling had been detected, and at that time raised the alert levels accordingly.Kilauea had a major eruption in  that destroyed more than  homes and displaced thousands of residents. Before that eruption, the volcano had been slowly erupting for decades, but mostly not in densely populated residential areas.Before the major  eruption, Kilauea had been erupting since  and streams of lava occasionally covered rural farms and homes. During that time, the lava sometimes reached the ocean, causing dramatic interactions with the water.Over four months in , Kilauea spewed enough lava to fill , Olympic-sized swimming pools, burying an area more than half the size of Manhattan in up to  feet of now-hardened lava. The molten rock reduced landmarks, streets and neighbourhoods to a vast field of blackened boulders and volcanic shard.After the  eruption the summit lava lake stopped erupting and for the first time in recorded history began to fill with water, raising concerns about the possibility of an explosive interaction between lava and groundwater. vw,vw,px, px\"A view of an eruption that has begun in the Halemaumau crater at the summit of Hawaiirsquos Kilauea volcano The same area of the volcano that began erupting on Wednesday also erupted in December and lasted until May.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane told The Associated Press that she had not yet arrived at the park, but that colleagues reported seeing some lava spatter and glow within the summit crater.ldquoHe saw that from Volcano House, which is at least two miles away from the eruption site, so I suspect hellip wersquoll be able to see a pretty glow, and who knows what , she said.The Volcano House is a hotel and restaurant within the national park adjacent to the visitor centre. The park is open to visitors. vw,vw,px, px\"Billowing clouds of volcanic gas were seen rising into the air Ms Ferracane said the area that is erupting is not close to where people can hike or drive. Trails downwind from the eruption have been closed for years.ldquoThe park is open and there are no road closures at this time, Ms Ferracane said.Ms Ferracane added that officials are expected tens of thousands of visitors to flock into the park and that people need to be very careful both in terms of natural hazards and Covid-.ldquoThis eruption is going to draw many people to the park, wersquore already seeing people come into the park, drive in after dark tonight, Ms Ferracane said. ldquoReally need people to remember that we are in the middle of a pandemic and they need to stay safe and to keep us safe, too.She said people must maintain six feet of distance and wear masks.ldquoIf yoursquore sick, please donrsquot come.

MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting.

You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4105495.jpg--.jpg?1632298509000\n","title":"dog lovers needed for land bark survey","story":"DOGS Trust in Northern Ireland is calling on local dog lovers to take part in the biggest ever nationwide survey to help dogs and owners of the future.The National Dog Survey, launched by Dogs Trust, will help the charity better-understand the UK’s . million-strong pooch population and the part dogs play in their owners’ lives, shaping the support the charity offers to canine companions and their families.Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager for Dogs Trust in Ballymena, says:“Through this survey we want to learn as much as possible about dog ownership to inform what we do to improve dog welfare and support dog owners. “Dogs Trust has been around for  years and in that time so much has changed when it comes to dogs being at the heart of our family. “This is the first time we have carried out a survey of this kind and we want to hear from dog owners as well as people who don’t currently have a dog but have lived with one in the past.

It also covers people’s post-pandemic plans for their dog such as are they hoping to take them into the office with them or will they employ a dog walker,they are ing to their workplace.The survey, which can be completed online at www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk, also asks people to say how having a dog improves their le, what advice they would give to people looking to welcome a dog into their family and what one thing could Dogs Trust do to help them and their dog live happily together.Conor adds:“We always love to hear tales from owners who have adopted from us, and every single one of them has a dferent story to tell. We now want to capture the experiences of all local dog owners so we can build a picture of dog ownership today and what more Dogs Trust can do to help them and their dogs.“This will be the most comprehensive census of dogs and dog lovers ever completed and we would love iteveryone who is passionate about dogs could do their bit to help our four-legged friends of the future have the best lives possible.“What people tell us today will help us make sure we are able to do everything we can to support dogs and their owners for the next  years and more.”For more information and to take part in the National Dog Survey, visit www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk Dog owners who complete the survey will get tailored behaviour advice sent direct to them.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

A % deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now around % of gross income – a record high.“Due to the historically low level of interest rates, the cost of servicing the typical mortgage is still well below the levels recorded in the run-up to the financial crisis. However, even on this measure, affordability is becoming more challenging.“For example,we look at typical mortgage payments relative to take-home pay across the country, it is notable that in the majority of UK regionsthis ratio is now above its long-run average. By contrast, pre-pandemic, this was only the case in one region .“Recent price patterns suggest an element of rebalancing is occurring where most of the regions that have seen the strongest price growth are those in which affordability is still close to or below the long-run average.”Mr Gardner said the outlook remains uncertain.He added: “Activity is likely to soften for a period after the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of September, given the incentive for people to bring forward their purchases to avoid the additional tax.“Moreover, underlying demand is likely to soften around the turn of the yearunemployment rises as Government support winds down, as seems likely.“But this is far from assured. The labour market has remained remarkably resilient to date and, evenit does weaken, there is scope for shts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic – such as wanting more space or to relocate – to continue to support activity for some time yet.”Here are average house prices in the third quarter of this year and the annual increase, according to Nationwide Building Society:– Wales, £,, .%– Northern Ireland, £,, .%– Yorkshire and the Humber, £,, .%– Scotland, £,, .%– North West, £,, .%– North East, £,, .%– East Midlands, £,, .%– West Midlands, £,, .%– South West, £,, .%– Outer South East£,, .%– East Anglia, £,, .%– Outer politan£,, .%– London, £,, .%.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadWilliam and Kate begin Northern Ireland visit by meeting university studentsEx-Presbyterian minister faces trial over indecent image of children chargesGillian HallidayOpinionPetrol shortages: Northern Ireland missed out on fuel crisis – but could now see prices rocketTenants stunned at leading caravan park’s % price hikeMark Gourley inquest: Detective says missing loyalist most likely killed by UDA and body dumped at seaTop VideosPlayVideo: Kate gets hands on tarantula during Ulster University visitPlayVideo: RAF Tornado fighter arrives at Ulster Aviation Society hanger in LisburnPlayReaction: Barry#s in Portrush closes for goodLatest Northern IrelandNI diplomat David McIlroy tells of shielding from gunfire and explosions during Guinea coupDelight for NI chef Danny Millar as Stock restaurant added to Michelin GuideQuestions remain over probe into blast which killed young officer – DonaldsonToday#s headlines: British agents #colluded with IRA in killing my RUC we#Tenants stunned at leading caravan park’s % price hikeLatestNI diplomat David McIlroy tells of shielding from gunfire and explosions during Guinea coupDelight for NI chef Danny Millar as Stock restaurant added to Michelin GuideFamilies of Killamarsh victims tell of ‘indescribable pain’David Tennant to play Alexander Litvinenko in new ITV dramaIrish homes ‘contain average of  to  broken or unused electrical items’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The price rise is an insult. Other sites were actually giving customers discounts we got nothing. We took that on the chin and they’ve repaid us with a kick in the teeth.“Also, they won’t break down the bill to explain the increase, even though the site was closed for part of the year and the facilities were closed for most of the year.”The caravan owner, who asked to remain anonymous, said the majority of owners — who were informed of the hike last week — are furious. “The caravan park lacks facilities but that hasn’t stopped them from charging more money,” they said.“Residents have asked for indoor facilities for teenagers for at least six years. It was even promised on last year’s billing letter but never materialised.“We’ve asked for security barriers, as we feel vulnerable in comparison to other sites.“We had a chippy hut which closed four years ago we’ve been asking for it back to no avail.“Skerries Holiday Park next door has a chippy, a barrier and an indoor facility for teenagers. They have all the things we’ve been asking for and we pay more than people there.”Dozens of people have expressed their concerns over an inability to pay the increase.“Some people just can’t afford it,” the caravan owner said.“Some have been furloughed for two years, others have lost their jobs. Someone is going through chemo and doesn’t have the energy to fight it.“One man bought a new van last year with his retirement money. He was fully aware he would have to pay an increase of % each year even but he can’t meet this outrageous increase.“If anyone challenges the increase the worry is that the caravan will be lted so everyone is afraid to speak up.”The caravan owner added: “The site received on average £, of fees from  caravans, which equals £,,, in .

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

Mrs McLaughlin was speaking in a debate the impact of the proposed Universal Credit cut in Foyle in the Assembly at Stormont. She highlighted the West-East discrepancy in terms of where the highest and lowest levels of employment are with the west of Northern Ireland coming a poor second to the east. googletag.cmd.push One aspect she focused on was the amount of investment that has come to Belfast in comparison to Derry. The SDLP spokesperson for the Economy and Energy pointed out that while , jobs have been announced this year by the economy minister for location in Belfast, that none have been announced for Derry. She said: “I have in front of me a map. It is coloured in shades. The darkest colours show the highest rates of Universal Credit receipt.  “Three constituencies are in the darkest colours. Those are Foyle, North Belfast and West Belfast. There is one really, really light-coloured area which represents Lagan Valley. “Much of the East is actually pretty light, which shows where the highest paid jobs and the highest employment rates are located. “When the UK’s prime minister justies cutting Universal Credit, he says that he wants people to earn more through their work, rather than through their benefit payments. “Well, where in Derry are those jobs  Perhaps the communities and economy ministers can suggest how those who are unemployed in Derry can get jobs  And how those in badly paid jobs can get work that pays more      “I hear, yet again, this week of new jobs going to Belfast. ASOS is bringing  jobs to Belfast. “Two weeks ago, the economy minister announced Agio are to create  jobs in Belfast. “Last month he announced  jobs at Tribe, on the edge of Belfast. In June, it was  jobs with PwC, in Belfast. “Also in June, it was  jobs in Belfast with Vision . In February, it was  jobs in Belfast with KPMG. “In January, it was  jobs with Everquote, headquartered where  Belfast of course. “Not that all the jobs have gone to Belfast. Some  have gone to Bangor. “But where and when are the jobs coming to Derry  “In April, the then-economy minister said the recovery in the North West is important. “In February that same former economy minister expressed concern about Derry – not about the lack of jobs being created in my city, but about additional students coming to Magee to study health and le science, and what that might mean for Coleraine. “However, congratulations to Belfast, with its large university campuses, graduates, commuters and much higher pay than in the West.” Speaking on the session in the Assembly yesterday on the impact of the proposed Universal Credit cut in Foyle, People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll highlighted the neglect and poverty that Derry has suffered – which he warned would get worse with the pound cut in Universal Credit. He said: “Like my own constituency of West Belfast, far too many peoplestruggle with poverty, the lack of housing, low wages and the effects of decades of neglect. “The failure to increase Magee to a , student population by now is one of the many injustices the Stormont Executive has failed to recty. So is the abysmal failure to improve and vastly expand rail provision for Foyle and across the entire North West. “As my colleague Eamonn McCann has said many times, the old Stormont regime failed the people of Derry and Foyle but so too has the new Stormont regime. “Twenty-seven per cent of people in Derry and Strabane live below the poverty line. Foyle, just like West Belfast, has been ravaged by the welfare reforms brought in by the Executive. “The Executives determination to run public services into the ground in favour of privatisation that allows a tiny few to profiteer is also having a dramatic impact on peoples wellbeing. “Theres no doubt that people across the North, including in Foyle, will be hit very hard by the proposed cut to Universal Credit. “Given Derry and Foyles existing levels of deprivation, the cut to Universal Credit, out of control energy prices, pay cuts for health workers and new taxes will hit the area very hard. “The Stormont Executive is talking about finally putting in place an anti-poverty strategy. But it will mean very littlewe cant protect people right now. “Its shocking to me that the Executive has done nothing to demand a Wealth Tax on billionaires, rich corporations and elites. Its clear they dont want to upset elites. “Theres a lot of feigned concern for those trapped in poverty and dependent on food banks in the Assembly from Executive parties. “But all five of those parties campaigned for a massive cut in taxes for rich, very rich, corporations while they agreed to bring in Tory welfare reforms. That action tells us more about the priorities of government parties than all their words of concern. “If the Tories follow through on plans to slash Universal Credit, People Before Profit is calling for the Executive to step-in with funding to make sure no one loses out. “We need less talk about anti-poverty strategies. We need action not promises from the Executive. “The Executive threw people in Foyle, and across the North, to the wolves by signing up to Tory welfare reforms. The Executive shouldnt do it again. Lets commit now to making sure no one is punished by the cruel Tory cut to Universal Credit.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

Reporter: Liam Tunney Sept Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry coffee shop has begun hosting weekly parent and toddler sessions as it looks to provide a safe place for them to socialise. Liam Tunney caught up with owner FiFi Garrett to find out why.The sound of excited children floats down the steps of Cumber House and echoes off the high wall of trees that flank either side of the laneway leading up the hill. Cars are parked around the gravel that surrounds the house, most pointed towards the trees and away from the village of Claudy that lies further up the hill to its rear. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the ornate steps sits a small sign that gives some clue to the source of the excited voices and laughter. The popular coffee shop is based in the historic Cumber House, Claudy. FiFi Garrett opened Slothy Coffee in July . It marked the next step in a personal journey that was given a signicant nudge by the Covid- pandemic. “I was on universal credit pretty much since the pandemic started, and it was really hard,” she told the County Derry Post. “I was an unemployed artist I do a lot of digital art, but obviously, that doesnt pay the bills. My partner was working from home at the time, and we both just said we couldnt go on like this. “We knew we needed to do something, and wed noticed a lot of these small coffee shops popping up, so that was our original business model. “We approached the council, but getting licences was really hard, so they suggested we went for private land.” As luck would have it, a postcard-perfect stretch of private land lay just a stones throw away at Cumber House.     Picturesque surroundings at Cumber House. Owned by local GAA club John Mitchels GAC, the building already had a commercial kitchen in place, which meant FiFi and her husbands plans would have to change a little. “We suddenly had to change our model from very small to something a lot bigger, but its been really exciting,” she said. “We put together our business plan and opened in July. We had to get a personal loan, because we didnt qualy for any funding. “It has been a case of one hand in, one out, for buying more furniture. We got a really good deal to get the machine that we rent. “We knew we had the customer base, but the problem here is that you dont get the passing trade, so thats what started us off with running events. “We have to find inventive ways of getting people in, so thats where Tots n Toast came in.” Tara Craig and Roisin McCloskey enjoying the morning with sons Dylan and Adam. Now in its second week, the Tots n Toast initiative has drawn in a healthy crowd of local parents and toddlers, and is proving a big hit. FiFi says she had hoped to bring some of the calming atmosphere of the houses surroundings into the event. “I have a five-year-old daughter who has special needs, and I found a lot of groups that were popping up around Derry were very loud and very noisy. “Theyre great, but theyre not necessarily for every child. She hated noise, shed just sit there covering her ears. “I wanted to do something a bit more serene, because you have the relaxing surroundings of the forest here. “I wanted to do books that would inspire them to explore, so we did The Gruffalo last week. You can imagine them all going round afterwards looking for it.” Ann and Michael Feeney, Claire and Islay Donaghy and Catherine Mullan with sons Aodhaacuten and Oisiacuten enjoyig their morning out at Slothy Coffee in Claudy. With the local area not qualying for the SureStart programme, there have been limited opportunities for parents and toddlers in Claudy. Two local parents, Roisin McCloskey and Tara Craig, tell me the weekly event is providing them with a safe space to socialise. “This is my first time here. Since Covid, all the wee toddler groups have stopped and its hard to get spaces.” said Roisin. “Its lovely and its great for the children. It helps, because there has been nothing for the weans this last while, nowhere to bring them.” “Its a space where they can be themselves and you can actually enjoy your coffee, because everyone is doing the same thing,” said Tara. “People are still quite cautious about getting out and about, but its nice to be able to do that. Every week Ive come in, Ive met someone new.” As well as the safety and openness of the space, other parents mentioned the beauty of the houses grounds and the peaceful atmosphere. “Its a lovely, relaxing, pleasant wee morning, and its great for the weans to get out as well,” said Claire Donaghy. “There are no real places like this in the village. Round here is nice, with the setting and the walk way, and the children love it.” Catherine Mullan said her sons Oisiacuten and Aodhaacuten loved getting to see the other children. “Its a great place Im surprised there has been nothing in here before,” she said. “Its nice that the weans can go and play with other children and you get to meet other parents as well. “Plus, the coffee is great,” she added.  FiFi says meeting the parents has emphasised for her just how important socialising is on the back of the last  months of Covid-related restrictions. “Depression and anxiety is a real problem at the moment,” she said. “There are many parents whose partners may be going back to work again, and suddenly, theyre isolated on their own. “Its good to get people out and talking to other parents who are in the same boat that they mightnt have met yet. “Its been really popular. We get the same people coming back too, which is really nice. The feedback has been good. “They enjoy that they get nice coffee and treats and can relax knowing their little ones are listening to a story and having fun. “Claudy is such a nice, close community and its trying to get it out there that were open, warm, cosy and ready for people to take part.”  Claudy footballer going the extra mile for charity  Oran Armstrong running km per day in aid of Aware NI    County Derry Primary School launch new Sports Academy  Pupils will get five hours of exercise a week    LIFE IN LOCKDOWN: Missing chat and company in Claudy  The north Derry village is raring to get back to some form of normality.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Errigal Senior Shield Final Glen -Ballymaguigan - This was a battle from start to finish in a very even contest. In the end it was to be O’Loughlin that was to settle the issue with - after Quigan had levelled the game just after the second water break. Also key to the victory was the performance of Danielle Kivlehan who was immense for the winners including a ing block out of the top drawer to deny Aoe McGlone midway through the second half. googletag.cmd.push Glen captain Caoimhe Kirkpatrick with the shield after Wednesdays final. Ballymaguigan had only led once in the game, that the opening point from a free by Erin Doherty on four minutes. Glen though took control with quick hands from Breena O’Loughlin and Bronagh McNicholl creating the opportunity that Mary NiacuteLochlainn took from close range. The second major came soon after when a Ballymaguigan effort had dropped short Glen built a good move from defence to attack the was finished with a Claire McGroggan chip over Leanne McKeown and into the net. The response was immediate as Erin Doherty saw her dipping effort find the net to get her side right back into the game. The opening exchanges were played at a lightening pace and two quick fire points from McNicholl and McGroggan moved the eventualwinners four clear. A fine point from Anna Martin reduced the deficit on the water break. Ballymaguigan enjoyed the better up until the break but were wasteful and could only add a point from Erin O’Neill despite all their possession while Glen failed to score to leave it at the break Glen - Ballymaguigan -. Ballymaguigan had a glorious chance at the start of the second half when they were awarded a penalty but Erin O’Neill saw her effort palmed over the bar by Louise Gunn. Annie NiacuteLochlainn brought an end to the Glen scoring drought with a point seven minutes in the second half, their first score from the th minute. Leanne McCrystal followed up with a great score to extend that advantage.     Ballymaguigan had a great chance when a poor sickout from Gunn offered Lauren Crozier a goal opportunity but her effort came back off the post. The excellent McGlone who was causing Glen dficulty with her strong runs fired over a point. Dervla Stinson came from half back to point to leave just the one between the sides at the second water break. McGlone levelled matters on the resumption before O’Louchlin pounced for that all important goal when her effort went over the head of McKeown.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

Councillor McGlinchey made the comments last night , three days after a continuous lane closure was put in place at Chapel Road, Dungiven. Temporary traffic lights have been operating since Friday, September  and are expected to be in place until Friday, October  to facilitate work as part of the bypass of Dungiven town. googletag.cmd.push As a result of the lane closure, there has been y tailbacks in both directions, something which Councillor McGlinchey says must end. Fridays Derry intermediate football championship clash between Steelstown and Ballymaguigan was scheduled for pm at Derry GAAs Centre of Excellence in Dungiven, but county officials were forced to delay the throw-in by  minutes as Ballymaguigan supporters, players and match officials were caught up in the tailback. Lavey supporters attending their clubs senior championship clash  with Claudy, also on Friday night, missed part of the first half, with the roadworks also causing their delay in getting to Banagher. “The long delays are totally unacceptable and just not good enough,” said Councillor McGlinchey. “People living in Magherabuoy, Traceys Way, Abbey Fields and Glenroe Park cannot get in and out of their homes because of the traffic and drivers blocking the entrances to the estates. “Our party met with the Department for Infrastructure six months ago and asked them to come back and complete the roundabout at a later date. The contractor, Wills Bros, have been very accomodating but it is the Department for Infrastructure and the client Aecom that need to make the decision.” Councillor McGlinchey said the long delays are also having a major impact on local businesses in Dungiven.     “People are avoiding stopping at local shops because of the long delays in traffic and these businesses are missing out even though there is a simple solution,” he said, adding that his party colleague, MLA Caoimhe Archibald has called for an urgent meeting with DfI and Aecom to discuss the issues. “We are asking the Department and client Aecom to intervene as this cannot continue. A common sense approach is needed here and I will be calling on these roadworks to be suspended until such times as a solution is found.” Last night, a DfI spokesperson said: “The Department can confirm that Caoimhe Archibald MLA has todayrequested a meeting to discuss the roadworks at Dungiven. “The Department has been engaging with local representatives and has received positive feedback on this engagement. The Department is happy to arrange another meeting with Dr Archibald.” Aecom was contacted for a response, however at the time of going to print, they had failed to respond to the County Derry Posts request.

And it has also helped to create shared spaces and build good relations that will support meaningful integration in years to come. I would like to congratulate everyone involved in the programme and thank them for their incredible efforts towards ending ision and promoting community cohesion. Initiatives such as this are crucial in helping our entire society move forward and become an inclusive, united community where everyone is treated equally.” Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, commented: “I want to congratulate Mid Ulster District Council on their achievements under their EU PEACE IV funded Local Authority Action Plan. “I am delighted that my Department was able to provide match funding and support for the delivery of this important plan which has delivered beneficial projects and six shared spaces for all those living in the area, which I am sure will serve as a tangible memory of your hard work and dedication. The accomplishments and goals achieved as part of this Action Plan would not have been possible without the involvement of all the participants. I look forward to seeing your great achievements built on under the new PEACE Plus programme which will provide substantial investment in the region over the coming years”. Speaking at the event, Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Paul McLean said: “The PEACE IV funded Local Authority Plan delivered in our district has hugely benefited all communities, successfully delivering positive relations within and across district boundaries. In particular, it has contributed to the lives of over , children and young people, who participated in a range of projects focusing on cultural ersity, good relations and sports engagement. “The legacy of the PEACE IV programme is perhaps most visible in the development of six shared sites that encourage use by erse communities, and play a vital role in the revitalisation and ongoing vibrancy of our towns and villages. We are extremely grateful to our funders for supporting such a successful programme.” Other projects funded under the action plan were instrumental in building positive relations, including both small grants delivered by a range of local community groups, and council led initiatives delivering Cross Border engagement. This activity has been successful in re-affirming peace and reconciliation across the border through shared heritage of the Clans and shared literature of our Poet Laureates, Yeats and Heaney. The Shared Spaces and Services strand of the programme has created six shared sites across Mid Ulster, including Aughnacloy, Castledawson, Donaghmore, Draperstown, Moneymore and Moy. A further three grants were funded under this theme to promote shared space, peace and reconciliation. Most recently, a newly funded programme aimed to develop an all year round events space has been launched. Discussing the signicance of Mid Ulster’s Action Plan, Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said: “Unfortunately, despite many years of positive progress, we still continue to experience high levels of sectarianism and racism, with many communities remaining segregated, and limited opportunities for people to engage with each other. The PEACE IV-funded Local Authority Action Plans, across Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland provide opportunities to change this, and have supported many thousands of people to take courageous steps forward to create a more cohesive and forward-thinking society. These Action Plans have helped overcome barriers to cross-community engagement and built capacity for many dferent groups to engage in peace and reconciliation activities. I congratulate the Council on their dedication to delivering this Action Plan, particularly given all of the many dficulties resulting from COVID-,” she continued.

The call comes from SDLP Foyle MLA Sineacutead McLaughlin who was speaking after being told by Health Minister Robin Swann that the local service was under serious pressure,to the point that thealready long waiting list to access contraception through the Family Planning Service was closed to new appointments. googletag.cmd.push Ms McLaughlin said: “Several constituents contacted me to complain about delays in accessing contraception servicesthrough the Family Planning Service. In his answer to my written question, health minister Swann revealedthat people in Derry are at a signicant disadvantage compared to people in other areas in the North when it comes to accessing this essential healthcare service. “While I am pleased the Western Trust was able to start accepting new clients from July this year, I am very concerned at the impact of waiting for access toa full range of contraceptive options. “These need to be accessible to all who need them, when they need them. “I have also written to Health Minister Swann to ask whether his department has any strategy in place to tackle this issue and whether he will commit to making the necessary funding available to ensure there are enough staff to meet demand and reduce waiting times for an appointment. While I realise the Western Trust is dealing with a range of dficult challenges, including staff shortages, it must recognise that access to contraception can be essential in avoiding unintended pregnancies and the personal crisis this can cause.     “Not only do my constituents deserve improved access to the full range of healthcare services, but increased investment in contraception has been demonstrated to save public money in the long term.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

The Forum is one of  groups across the north of Ireland to receive a chunk of the pound.million funding pot which is part of the first tranche of grants from the Mental Health Support Fund. googletag.cmd.push General manager of the Forum, Aileen McGuinness, expressed her delight at the award saying the money would help improve existing community programmes as well as allowing the Forum greater scope to develop new ones. She said: “The mental health strategy came out and there was a lot of consultation around it. We were very central in tying in with that as its been a direction of the organisation for a long time with mental health services that have been very much underfunded. “A lot of mental health services we funded ourselves through fundraising events like Jog In The Bog and other events. “We saw the strategy come out which we were really excited about. Obviously half a million pounds is a big pot of funding. Ourselves and other community organisations in the five areas – ourselves, Outer West, Outer North, Waterside and Strabane – came together to put in a large application. “We found out that our application was successful last week and were over the moon. “It would have been a very hard competition out there with a lot of other people because mental health hasnt been funded.     “A lot of people would have seen the benefits of bringing that funding under their own communities. “So were delighted that Derry and Strabane was recognised as an area where theres a need for investment. The award is going to give us a wee bit of substance to the programmes that were doing. “It will help support those people in need. It doesnt have to be people, for example, that need one-to-one counselling, its a wide range of programmes that we provide from physical activity, mental health support, group sessions, nutritional support. Its a holistic programme. “Then there is that higher level of one-to-one support and theres small group sessions. “The programme dont necessarily have to be for anybody who is in dire need, it is a preventative programme as well as an intervention one too. “We just want to make sure that we get that message out there that there will be programmes running within the area that could be a -week cooking programme or a -week physical activity programme. “Its just getting that message that every element of your le is impacted by your mental health. “The award will give us the freedom to introduce new programmes as well. There will be four new -week programmes across the five areas. “They will obviously be catered towards the needs of each area. For example,someone has been isolated for a long period of time, they will receive some support to come into community organisations. “What we find is that the major challenge for people getting out there is hitting that first step over the doorway of our community organisation. But once they make that first step, thats where we see their engagement increase and then become a member of their own community and feel pride in it. Ms McGuinness admitted that had the Forums application for the award not been successful, then the pressures faced by them prior to receiving the good news would still be there. She added: “Had we not got this award, we would be back to fundraising ourselves – not that theres anything to be taken away from that. “But these areas would have needs that could not be addressed and those pressures would still be on the community organisations. “Our services are very strained and we can only do as much as we can. “If we didnt have this award, we would just be battling the same battle as we have always done, day in, day out and going above and beyond. “Hopefully this will give us room for manoeuvre to bring people through the door but also to provide extra training and support for community organisations so that we can become a trauma informed district. “This basically means that staff would be trained to have a unied approach identying that there is trauma out there. “We all have trauma in our lives – it doesnt have to be this big massive impact. Its how a person reacts to a situation and everybody being open and understanding to that.” While Ms McGuinness says that the award is a boon for the Forum, a lot more help and support is needed from the powers that be in order for mental health support to covered across the north of Ireland. She continued: “Obviously in the long term, mental health needs more funding from the Government and the Executiveso that we dont have to rely on a grant application every year being successful. “This is the start of the ten-year strategy so we hope that this is a continuation. Also with integrated care systems coming down the line, we hope this is a new way of working in that were listening to community organisations on how they work and address the issues we face.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council held a confidential ‘in committee’ meeting on Monday night to discuss legal advice on the ownership of Portstewart Town Hall. googletag.cmd.push In , the Council received Notice to Quit from the buildings legal owners, the Montagu Estate. A -year lease taken by the Council on the property had expired in the s. Portstewart Community Group had launched an online petition urging the Council to pause legal proceedings, and this evening slammed the actions of the Council, saying they were ‘deeply disappointed’. ”The council is proceeding with the handover to the Montagu Estate, despite the fact that, in just a few days, our petition requesting a pause to legal proceedings has gained over , signatures from concerned members of the public,” they said. “One of our greatest frustrations has been that so much business has been conducted under the shroud of legal privilege.  “This has frustrated our efforts to retain the building in public ownership and it has made it almost impossible to hold the council to account for their actions and decisions. “Nevertheless, the vote to hand the building over and the vote against delaying the legal proceedings are both on public record, and we are grateful to all those councillors who voted to support the community in their desire to retain the town hall. “What is neither clear nor available on public record is what efforts were made by the Council to retain the town hall for the people of Portstewart.”     The group are now worried a precedent has been set by the Council in relation to public ownership or buildings. “This property transfer is a worrying precedent for the town of Portstewart and the entire borough. What other buildings might be affected in a similar way  This issue raises serious concerns regarding Council governance,” they said. “It is a shame that the Council used its statement to say that ‘previous leaks to the media about this matter harmed its legal position.’  “Public and media scrutiny of the Councils actions are an important element of democracy and accountability. “The Council must expect such scrutiny, particularly over such a contentious issue, and particularly when the Council has been so reluctant to release information or respond to Freedom of Information requests on the matter. “So much of the anger and frustration felt by the community is a result of the lack of communication from, and accountability by, our Council.” Council Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to engage directly with the Montagu Estate over the future of the building, and the group said they intend to continue their cause. ”We will continue to seek avenues to retain Portstewart town hall for our community,” they said. ”It is deeply regrettable that Portstewart Conservation Society was not supported in its efforts to source grant funding for the repairs needed to bring the town hall back into use and to keep the building in public ownership. “It is clear that Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council have not been good custodians of our historical town hall, which has served our community and sat at the heart of our town since the s. ”We thank the public for their ongoing support of our campaign. We are proud to be serving our community to work in its best interest and to hold our council to account for its actions and inactions.  “We will strive to continue to do this, despite the frustrations we have encountered to date, because this is what our community is asking us to do. ”Our town, and our town hall, deserved so much better than this.“  Council to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall  The Mayor said the community were ‘free to negotiate’ with the owners over its use.    Ongoing petition urging Council to keep County Derry town hall  The Council will hold a confidential meeting tonight to discuss legal advice on the halls ownership.    Council accounts ratication delayed by ownership issues  Cllr Aaron Callan has said work is underway to address the issues.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council held a confidential ‘in committee’ meeting on Monday night to discuss legal advice on the ownership of Portstewart Town Hall. googletag.cmd.push In , the Council received Notice to Quit from the buildings legal owners, the Montagu Estate. A -year lease taken by the Council on the property had expired in the s. Portstewart Community Group had launched an online petition urging the Council to pause legal proceedings, and this evening slammed the actions of the Council, saying they were ‘deeply disappointed’. ”The council is proceeding with the handover to the Montagu Estate, despite the fact that, in just a few days, our petition requesting a pause to legal proceedings has gained over , signatures from concerned members of the public,” they said. “One of our greatest frustrations has been that so much business has been conducted under the shroud of legal privilege.  “This has frustrated our efforts to retain the building in public ownership and it has made it almost impossible to hold the council to account for their actions and decisions. “Nevertheless, the vote to hand the building over and the vote against delaying the legal proceedings are both on public record, and we are grateful to all those councillors who voted to support the community in their desire to retain the town hall. “What is neither clear nor available on public record is what efforts were made by the Council to retain the town hall for the people of Portstewart.”     The group are now worried a precedent has been set by the Council in relation to public ownership or buildings. “This property transfer is a worrying precedent for the town of Portstewart and the entire borough. What other buildings might be affected in a similar way  This issue raises serious concerns regarding Council governance,” they said. “It is a shame that the Council used its statement to say that ‘previous leaks to the media about this matter harmed its legal position.’  “Public and media scrutiny of the Councils actions are an important element of democracy and accountability. “The Council must expect such scrutiny, particularly over such a contentious issue, and particularly when the Council has been so reluctant to release information or respond to Freedom of Information requests on the matter. “So much of the anger and frustration felt by the community is a result of the lack of communication from, and accountability by, our Council.” Council Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to engage directly with the Montagu Estate over the future of the building, and the group said they intend to continue their cause. ”We will continue to seek avenues to retain Portstewart town hall for our community,” they said. ”It is deeply regrettable that Portstewart Conservation Society was not supported in its efforts to source grant funding for the repairs needed to bring the town hall back into use and to keep the building in public ownership. “It is clear that Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council have not been good custodians of our historical town hall, which has served our community and sat at the heart of our town since the s. ”We thank the public for their ongoing support of our campaign. We are proud to be serving our community to work in its best interest and to hold our council to account for its actions and inactions.  “We will strive to continue to do this, despite the frustrations we have encountered to date, because this is what our community is asking us to do. ”Our town, and our town hall, deserved so much better than this.“  Council to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall  The Mayor said the community were ‘free to negotiate’ with the owners over its use.    Ongoing petition urging Council to keep County Derry town hall  The Council will hold a confidential meeting tonight to discuss legal advice on the halls ownership.    Council accounts ratication delayed by ownership issues  Cllr Aaron Callan has said work is underway to address the issues.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

People have been urged to get their tickets early with an expected surge of people buying tickets as the time nears. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June , which was the largest amount ever seen in the Lotto game. googletag.cmd.push If tonight’s Lotto jackpot exceeds the current jackpot cap of €. million and is won, then that amount will become the new Lotto jackpot cap going forward. If tonights Lotto jackpot exceeds the cap and is not won, Saturdays Lotto jackpot will remain capped at that level. As the jackpot will be capped, this means that no additional money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. A National Lottery spokesperson said:“Tonight’s draw is set to be one of the most exciting in the history of Lotto! If the jackpot is higher than €. million, the current record for highest jackpot ever will officially be broken. And of course,there is a jackpot winner, they will become the biggest Lotto winner in the history of the game in Ireland – what a title to take! The current jackpot roll has lasted for almost  months and we understand just how much of a buzz there is around the hugely le-altering amount. As we get closer to the cut-off time for sales at .pm this evening, we expect there to be an uptake in sales. We are advising players to purchase their tickets early and to follow public health guidelines while doing so. Don’t forget that tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or at www.lottery.ie.”     Meanwhile, there was no winner of last night’s €,, EuroMillions jackpot which means that Friday’s jackpot is now set to roll to a massive € million.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

People have been urged to get their tickets early with an expected surge of people buying tickets as the time nears. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June , which was the largest amount ever seen in the Lotto game. googletag.cmd.push If tonight’s Lotto jackpot exceeds the current jackpot cap of €. million and is won, then that amount will become the new Lotto jackpot cap going forward. If tonights Lotto jackpot exceeds the cap and is not won, Saturdays Lotto jackpot will remain capped at that level. As the jackpot will be capped, this means that no additional money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. A National Lottery spokesperson said:“Tonight’s draw is set to be one of the most exciting in the history of Lotto! If the jackpot is higher than €. million, the current record for highest jackpot ever will officially be broken. And of course,there is a jackpot winner, they will become the biggest Lotto winner in the history of the game in Ireland – what a title to take! The current jackpot roll has lasted for almost  months and we understand just how much of a buzz there is around the hugely le-altering amount. As we get closer to the cut-off time for sales at .pm this evening, we expect there to be an uptake in sales. We are advising players to purchase their tickets early and to follow public health guidelines while doing so. Don’t forget that tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or at www.lottery.ie.”     Meanwhile, there was no winner of last night’s €,, EuroMillions jackpot which means that Friday’s jackpot is now set to roll to a massive € million.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

Duffy first appeared under Declan Devine in , but didn’t become a regular until a year later. It wasn’t until he played regularly under Peter Hutton however that Duffy hit the headlines, with  goals in the  season, which earned him his move to Glasgow Celtic. googletag.cmd.push Today, we look back on Duffy’s best five moment in a Derry City shirt:  First goal vs. Shelbourne It was no surprise that Duffy began to make giant strides with the first team in  and he soon made his mark with his first senior goal away at Shelbourne on June , the young striker firing the ball ferociously into the roof of the net past Niall Burdon to ensure a - victory at Tolka Park. Double at Dalymount Derry City were struggling for consistency in the league, but cup success seemed plausible, even more so after Duffy’s brace at Dalymount Park sent the Candy Stripes into the League Cup semi-finals. Europa League statement Aberystwyth lost - at the Brandywell in their first leg Europa League tie in July, but still claimed they were on a par with Derry City, with a red card the only reason they had lost so emphatically. Proving a point, Derry went out and hammered them - in theleg, with Duffy scoring amidst a - win . The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history. Duffy and his team mates had made their point.     First hat trick Despite the disappointment of Europa league elimination against Shakytor Soligorsk, July,  ended on a high note for Derry City as they thrashed UCD - in Dublin. It was a game memorable for Michael Duffy’s first senior hat trick, three terric and confident finishes which added to the growing reputation of the youngster. Rovers’ downfall The FAI Cup semi-final replay at the Brandywell in  was hugely dramatic. After Rory Patterson had missed a late penalty, the game seemed to be headed to extra time until Duffy struck in the very last minute of the game. The forward reacted first to steer the loose ball past Barry Murphy and into the Rovers goal to send the Brandywell wild.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

Europa League statement Aberystwyth lost - at the Brandywell in their first leg Europa League tie in July, but still claimed they were on a par with Derry City, with a red card the only reason they had lost so emphatically. Proving a point, Derry went out and hammered them - in theleg, with Duffy scoring amidst a - win . The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history. Duffy and his team mates had made their point.     First hat trick Despite the disappointment of Europa league elimination against Shakytor Soligorsk, July,  ended on a high note for Derry City as they thrashed UCD - in Dublin. It was a game memorable for Michael Duffy’s first senior hat trick, three terric and confident finishes which added to the growing reputation of the youngster. Rovers’ downfall The FAI Cup semi-final replay at the Brandywell in  was hugely dramatic. After Rory Patterson had missed a late penalty, the game seemed to be headed to extra time until Duffy struck in the very last minute of the game. The forward reacted first to steer the loose ball past Barry Murphy and into the Rovers goal to send the Brandywell wild.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

The -year-old has agreed toto his home town club, joining Patrick McEleney by signing a pre-contract ahead of next season. It is huge news for City fans, who last seen Duffy in red and white back in , where he hit  goals in  appearances for the Candystripes. Since then he has gone on to play for Celtic, Alloa, Dundee and Dundalk, where he has been since . googletag.cmd.push It is huge news for Derry City, but Higgins, whilst delighted with the signing, does not want the focus taken off the remainder of this season. “It’s great news for the club,” he said. “He’s still a Dundalk player so we have to respect that but we look forward to welcoming him in the off-season and pre-season. “I don’t want us to get sidetracked and take our eye off the ball because there is a lot of football to be played between now and the end of the season. “The players and the staff have been brilliant and shown their quality so we need to remain focused on the final league games and try and pick up as many points as we can and see where it takes us. Everyone is working really hard and rolling in the one direction.” Higgins did admit however that he is eager to finalise his squad for  as soon as possible. “We’ll get stuff done when we can, but I just think it gives you more time to plan and prepare when you now what your squad is going to be,” he stated. “Things are going okay and we’re getting plenty of work done in the background.”     The Candystripes travel to Tallaght tomorrow to face champions Shamrock Rovers hoping for three points to boost their chances of European football next season. City are unbeaten in seven league games and are just three points off behind Sligo Rovers in third place, with Bohs four points further behind with a game in hand.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

The -year-old has agreed toto his home town club, joining Patrick McEleney by signing a pre-contract ahead of next season. It is huge news for City fans, who last seen Duffy in red and white back in , where he hit  goals in  appearances for the Candystripes. Since then he has gone on to play for Celtic, Alloa, Dundee and Dundalk, where he has been since . googletag.cmd.push It is huge news for Derry City, but Higgins, whilst delighted with the signing, does not want the focus taken off the remainder of this season. “It’s great news for the club,” he said. “He’s still a Dundalk player so we have to respect that but we look forward to welcoming him in the off-season and pre-season. “I don’t want us to get sidetracked and take our eye off the ball because there is a lot of football to be played between now and the end of the season. “The players and the staff have been brilliant and shown their quality so we need to remain focused on the final league games and try and pick up as many points as we can and see where it takes us. Everyone is working really hard and rolling in the one direction.” Higgins did admit however that he is eager to finalise his squad for  as soon as possible. “We’ll get stuff done when we can, but I just think it gives you more time to plan and prepare when you now what your squad is going to be,” he stated. “Things are going okay and we’re getting plenty of work done in the background.”     The Candystripes travel to Tallaght tomorrow to face champions Shamrock Rovers hoping for three points to boost their chances of European football next season. City are unbeaten in seven league games and are just three points off behind Sligo Rovers in third place, with Bohs four points further behind with a game in hand.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FiFi Garrett, owner of Slothy Coffee, is behind the initiative.

One of the most effective ways of identying how we meet these needs is consulting with our existing business stakeholders who have invested into our town and community.Cllr Sharvin said the proposed consultation will focus on the business communityrsquos view on what is positive about the work the local authority currently does.ldquoIt will also seek to find out what the organisation does not do so well, what businesses want to see in terms of support and what steps can be taken to attract additional investment, he continued.ldquoGiven Downpatrickrsquos rich and vibrant history, we have visitors coming from all over the world to visit St Patrickrsquos final resting place and complementing this is a fantastic array of attractions such as Inch Abbey, the St Patrick Centre, Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, Ballydugan medieval site, Struell Wells and Saul Church.ldquoHowever, the last thing I want is for those who visit the town and experience all this to then move on to Newry or Belfast.Cllr Sharvin said it is important that there are facilities for visitors to stay to have a meal and even remain in the town overnight.ldquoThis is something that I and my colleagues would like to see delivered which would have a positive,ripple effect on delivering a nightle that we can be proud of, he remarked.He said he believes that a town centre manager or a chamber of commerce could be the right mechanism to bring the town together and play a proactive role in attracting investment and new business to the area.He added: ldquoWe have to get the right blend of making Downpatrick attractive not only to tourists but, just as importantly, to residents who live and work in the area.ldquoI would urge all businesses to engage in the council survey and highlight what they would like to see in the Downpatrick area.

mdash Plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park in Downpatrick have this week been abandoned by Down Council.The local authority has admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre has fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, councillors hope the complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.News of the shock decision to abort the Dunleath Park scheme was confirmed at a meeting in the town on Monday night when it was revealed that for legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the Charities Board when the lease was first drawn up.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A popular Ballynahinch newsagent has this week been forced out of business by burglars who ransacked his store.On Monday the shutters were pulled down on

wrecked.Thieves smashed their way into the store some time between Sunday night and the early hours of Monday morning and after stealing a large amount of property they completely destroyed anything in sight with crow bars and sledge hammers.Police believe the attack was carried out by professionals who are more than likely from outside the area, probably Belfast, and would have needed ready transport to escape with the goods.Yesterday Mr Rice as adamant that he did not want to have anything more to do with the shop saying that he could not go on working there after the heartless attack.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh pensioner, who has been stripped of his -minute-a-day home help, has accused health officials of abandoning him.Seventy eight year-old John Heaney, who can only

the decision to remove his daily home help cam when the woman who has been attending him for the past number of years informed him two weeks ago she would not be back.He said he now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free travel for the elderly scheme during a meeting with Strangford MP Iris Robinson.Down councillor Peter Craig and Strangford MLA Kieran McCarthy have been at the forefront of the free travel for pensioners campaign.Describing the ferry crossing as a ldquovital service, Mr Campbell said he ldquofirmly believed free fares should be offered to senior citizens, in keeping with the Department for Regional Developmentrsquos policy to target concessions at users of public transport.The travel scheme will only be available to passengers over  years-old who are travelling by foot and will not be put into

prohibits sand and shingle being taken from the beach.NEWCASTLE mdash A telecommunications company which sparked controversy in Newcastle in recent weeks has taken steps towards healing damaged relations with local people.BT Cellnet representatives last week dismantled a mast at the Castlewellan Road in the town in an effort to appease the action group, Residents Against Masts , which was established to fight against the structure.The pressure group was formed last Monday night, just hours before the mast was erected against the wishes of local people who believe that it may put the health of children at risk.Following repeated calls by residents, BT Cellnet officials removed the -metre lamp post just two days later.The removal of the equipment has been hailed as a breakthrough by members of the RAM who have vowed to continue to fight against similar proposals in the town.A BT Cellnet spokesman this week confirmed that the mast had been taken down as a ldquogesture, but added that this was a ldquotemporary move.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Work to provide a new storm drain at a housing estate on the outskirts of Castlewellan is due to to start shortly.South Down MP Eddie McGrady has been lobbying the Housing Executive to ensure the drain is provided at the JFK estate in Burrendbridge as soon as possible.The MP said money for the scheme has been earmarked and revealed the drain will be provided at an alley-way at the rear of a number of houses.Mr McGrady said the drain is being installed in response to residentsrsquo complaints about flooding at their homes during

mental health initiative for Newry, Mourne and Down Council around the impact of rural isolation.Across the district, the geographical range that our constituents span is monumental in comparison to our population. That being said, it is no wonder that our rural communities may feel isolated from our bigger towns and cities, where investment and opportunities are more obvious.Rural isolation is closer to all of us than we realise exploring this topic brought to light my own childhood memories of growing up in the countryside.While I loved my upbringing, I hadnrsquot considered how it was impacted by the fact that I grew up in a rural area. It was through exploring the topic of rural isolation that I realised the social effects it can have on our youth.My own children are growing up in the countryside as well and I can now see how this may impact them socially they are not playing with friends in the evenings like many would in housing developments and built up areas.They are playing with each other in their own garden, similar to my own experience. While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation. Rural communities cannot continue to be left behind..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Its.jpg","title":"It’s goals that count for RGU  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK kick-started their Senior Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Actors.jpg","title":"Local actors Shine in short movie filmed around East Down  ","story":"LOCAL actors have been lighting up the big screen in a short film that has recently scooped a notable cinematic award.lsquoShinersquo wrapped up filming last November after cast and crew spent months shooting in a host of local areas such as Bright and Kilmore, and now it has been crowned the lsquoBest Online Short Filmrsquo at the Dublin Underground Film Cinema Festival.The movie has also been listed as a semi-finalist at this monthrsquos Cannes World Film Festival, whereits success is to continue, will make it through to next yearrsquos final.The dramatic tale tells the story of Nick, a young man who lacks confidence in expressing his dreams to his traditional family, and who is tasked with balancing his work le with helping his father on their family farm.Part-time director, writer and actor Declan Curran from Attical, drafted in favours from family members and friends to help bring his debut production to le.The film was an unfunded, therefore it was created with a very limited number of cast and crew.Declandescribed filming in his unclersquos ldquohundreds of years-old cottage in Bright as an ldquoouter body experience, but it was just one of the many things included in the -minute long flick which was close to his heart.ldquoI couldnrsquot be more grateful to my family and friends for their commitment, time and effort of the course of making this film, he said.ldquoI would never have been able to make this dream of mine a reality without them, therersquos loads of personal touches included in the film.The upcoming talent had the help of Bright natives Jimmy and John McIlmailwho star in roles as lsquoFather Hughesrsquo and lsquoJohnnyrsquo.Speaking about Jimmyrsquos role as the priest, Declan says despite his great uncle being completely new to the acting world, ldquothere was no better man for the job.ldquoI actually had Jimmy in mind when I wrote the character of Father Hughes, so it just made sense to me that he was the one to portray him, he said.ldquoThe priest appears in a bus with myself [Nick] during the film, and I actually was wearing my late granddads cap in that scene while my mother Dolores made the priest collar Jimmy was wearing, so it was very family orientated.ldquoDue to Covid- we faced a dficult year in filming, so we had to try find ways around things for shooting. For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents. It is right that we look at the issue of beach access, with a view to providing provisions for wheelchair-bound residents and visitors who wish to also enjoy our wonderful coastline.ldquo I donrsquot want this issue to go around in circles with reports, meetings and investigations. It is my hope that from this motion we see action, movement toward making the necessary access points needed to facilitate this initiative. Disabled beach access is a reality in other towns within these islands why not Newcastle.Cllr Lewis said work was needed to ensure the entire district is disabled access friendly, from changing to toilet facilities.He added: ldquoIncreased footfall to Newcastle during the good weather has brought many of these issues to the fore. As councillors, we must challenge ourselves to ensure that our district is accessible and open to all by facilitating the extra provisions needed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13056685.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We voted it down three times in the House of Commons in the midst of intense pressure to come round and vote for it.We consistently opposed Boris Johnson’s Protocol. Indeed, days before he succeeded in getting the Lib Dems and SNP to vote for a general election, we had stopped the protocol being progressed by winning a vote against his timetable motion. We supported the creation of a veto for the Northern Ireland Assembly by requiring a cross community vote for the creation of any regulatory borders. That is not support for a regulatory border. That is a veto on a regulatory border. That would have put the matter in our own hands, not the hands of London, or Dublin, or Brussels.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWhile not a great deal is known about the history of the village, there are signs of early occupation in the form of a Bronze Age flint tool and cooking mounds that have been discovered. The name of Bonvilston or Tresimwn dates back to the th century when the Norman lord Simon de Bonville was granted the manor by Robert Fitzhamon, Lord of Glamorgan and he constructed a ringwork castle as added protection for the castles at Dinas Powys and Sully.There are also references to monks being at Bonvilston and in a papal bull which is a public decree or charter issued by the Pope, a grange was mentioned in .When the parish became part of the Cottrell Estate, the last resident of Cottrell House was Mackintosh of Mackintosh from Moy in Scotland who was married to Lady Maud Cavendish. In  she donated the reading room for the male population of the village to learn to read, but it wasnrsquot until  that women were allowed in.At the end of the th century the Bassett family owned the estate and the family lived at Bonvilston House for more than  years. The house passed on through more famous names like Tudor Crawshay, the grandson of the well-known Ironmaster William Crawshay and then into the Brains brewery family. Although the house was demolished in  the lodge still remains.Gathering at Maes-y-Ffynon, which was built between  and  the group followed the bridleway at the far end of the road and walking between green hedges arrived at the busy lane which leads to Pendoylan. Crossing the lane and a stile a superb view opened out in front of them across a newly cropped field. Continuing downhill through a sheep-filled field and over the next stile they spotted two donkeys in the field, one of which looked very near to giving birth!At the bottom of the field a holly hedge was very carefully negotiated in order to enter a beautul garden belonging to Trehedyn House in the tiny hamlet of Tyrsquon y Pwll, said to be the birthplace of the Welsh hymn writer Thomas Williams, who later moved to Llantwit Major and in  built the Bethesda Chapel there.     Making their way through beautul meadows, they arrived at Lanlay Meadows in Peterston-super-Ely, which are owned by the National Trust. This quiet rural area has been farmed for centuries and the land is untouched by fertilisers, the hedges are left untrimmed, with its twisted oaks the area is rich in animal and plant le and forms part of the Ely Valley Site of Special Scientic Interest.A fairly rare plant Monkshood or Wolfsbane, which also has a number of other names, grows along the riverside and the whole plant, especially the root, is poisonous. The lovely orchard in the meadows provided the group with a great place to enjoy their morning refreshment in the increasingly warm sunshine, before backtracking slightly to follow a grassy path to the river which twists and turns its way along the northern edge of the meadows.Joining part of the Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail and following the river with its bends, nooks and crannies, an unmarked path led them through some rough, muddy ground. Then passing through fields whilst being preceded by a large herd of cattle, they exited just below the village of Pendoylan.Following a surprisingly busy road to re-enter fields on their journey to Caer Wigau Isaf, this th century Tudor manor house is Grade II listed and after a pause to admire the stunning stone and brick-work of the many buildings, they carried on through a small wooded area for the climb up to Lillypot Farm, where the fertile land was acquired by the Bonvillersquos in the th century.Climbing up through meadows they stopped for lunch at the base of their last climb whilst drinking in the stunning views across the Ely Valley. Then continuing their climb, at Lillypot Farm they were greeted by a lovely chestnut pony who was very friendly and eager to have his photo taken with them, before descending through fields near to the defensive ringwork of Y Gaer, an oval enclosure defended by a bank and ditch.Following a path bounded by gardens they arrived back at the extremely busy A to pass through the grounds of St Mary the Virgin Church, which dates from Norman times, but was rebuilt by the Victorians in  and only the tower and chancel arch remain of the original church, before ing to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The same area has been home to a large lava lake at ious times throughout the volcanorsquos eruptive past.The eruption is not in an area with homes and is entirely contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.ldquoAll signs indicate that it will stay within the crater, said Ken Hon, the USGS scientist in charge of Hawaii Volcano Observatory.ldquoWersquore not seeing any indications that lava is moving into the lower part of the east rt zone where people live.

Before that eruption, the volcano had been slowly erupting for decades, but mostly not in densely populated residential areas.Before the major  eruption, Kilauea had been erupting since  and streams of lava occasionally covered rural farms and homes. During that time, the lava sometimes reached the ocean, causing dramatic interactions with the water.Over four months in , Kilauea spewed enough lava to fill , Olympic-sized swimming pools, burying an area more than half the size of Manhattan in up to  feet of now-hardened lava. The molten rock reduced landmarks, streets and neighbourhoods to a vast field of blackened boulders and volcanic shard.     After the  eruption the summit lava lake stopped erupting and for the first time in recorded history began to fill with water, raising concerns about the possibility of an explosive interaction between lava and groundwater. vw,vw,px, px\"A view of an eruption that has begun in the Halemaumau crater at the summit of Hawaiirsquos Kilauea volcano The same area of the volcano that began erupting on Wednesday also erupted in December and lasted until May.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane told The Associated Press that she had not yet arrived at the park, but that colleagues reported seeing some lava spatter and glow within the summit crater.ldquoHe saw that from Volcano House, which is at least two miles away from the eruption site, so I suspect hellip wersquoll be able to see a pretty glow, and who knows what , she said.The Volcano House is a hotel and restaurant within the national park adjacent to the visitor centre.

Last week it transpired that five expressions of interest were received from parties interested in operating and managing a market. However, after a public consultation and the advertisement of a tender in May June, no tenders were received as part of the procurement process.During that committee meeting, Councillor Lavelle McIlwrath askedCouncil had consulted with the former market’s traders.The Council’s head of regeneration, Nicola Wilson said Council has had a ‘busy summer’ talking to traders and businesses through its consultation hub but had not been involved in direct consultation with the previous market’s traders.“In relation to the consultation with the existing market traders, we have not done that as we did not think it was an appropriate thing to do,” said Ms Wilson.“They are looking for a covered market space and that is not something we are going to be able to provide for them.“We have spoken to a lot of the town’s traders and a lot of the traders along Woodhouse Street as well to clary what we really want.“We will soon be in a position to go out with a tender that is more precise and detailed, I think that was probably one of the stumbling blocks in our first attempt to get a market provider in.“We are looking for an appropriate organisation to come in and provide the market service and that agent will be the one that will be liaising with the markets traders to try to develop what they need within the offering they have.”The Farmers’ Market traders are upset at being left out of the consultation. A spokesperson said: “Considering that some of the traders have been faithfully serving the public in Portadown for over  years, which is longer than a lot of other town traders, how was it not appropriate to consult with the people that it effected the most.”The traders, after last week’s council committee meeting, made an urgent request to the council to agree a date to meet. They also started an online petition which has over  signatures. The petition states: “The council has now sought to move the market to a new open air location in the town.“It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect traders and customers, many of whom are elderly, to spend large amounts of time shopping outside in all the inclement weather conditions in this region. “Customers would simply refuse to shop in wet and windy conditions and traders are unable to trade in bad weather and would lose income.”At the time of going to press, the Council had not responded to a request for a response.CouncilArmagh  \"       \"  Most PopularFour arrested after £k of cannabis found in Co Armagh and Lisburn propertiesSexual abuse by priests: Archbishop Eamon Martin apologises to victims in Dromore Diocese and sets up ‘Redress Scheme’Man arrested after ‘incident’ in CraigavonTwo charged after £k worth of drugs found in Tandragee, Armagh and LisburnPortadown market traders ‘insulted’ at lack of consultation by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon CouncilMost PopularFr Finegan victim ‘scared to death’Traffic ersion: Co Down road closed after crash and power line downPortadown LOL No hosting parade marking NI CentenaryTributes to Portadown businessman who died suddenlyOHara trio disqualied as company directors after jewellery firm goes bust                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632763167459.jpg--covid_19___mon_27th_september_figures.jpg?163276316700","title":"covid  mon th september figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The Minister said: “This is a big day in the roll-out of the High Street Scheme. I am delighted to announce that the portal for applications for the Spend Local card has now opened.” The Minister once again reminded applicants that the portal will remain open until October  and that there will be enough time for everyone to apply, receive and use their Spend Local card. Applicants can register for their card at http:nidirect.gov.uk spend-local He said: “Around . million people are entitled to apply for their Spend Local card, so we expect the portal to be extremely busy in the first few days. That is why it is important to remember that the portal will be open for four weeks and that everyone will have enough time to apply for their card. So please be patient.” The Minister reminded applicants to have their key information to hand when they come to apply. For verication purposes, all applicants will be asked to provide their name address age gender disability status National Insurance number email address and telephone number. He said: “Please ensure that you have all your required information ready when you apply, including your National Insurance number and driving licenceyou have one. There will be enough time for everyone to apply, receive and use their Spend Local card. The applications portal is robust and ready and it will be able to handle over . million applications over the course of the four-week period. But we expect early demand to be extremely high. Therefore, by being patient and ready with your information, you will be helping yourself and everybody .” Minister Lyons also warned people to be wary of scams and emphasised that the Department will never ask anyone for their personal banking details. He said: “Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous iniduals who will look for every opportunity to steal from others. It is important to state that the Department will never ask for anyone’s personal bank details. Anyone who receives any contact which they think may be a scam should contact Action Fraud.” The High Street Scheme is part of the Department’s Economic Recovery Action Plan.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
