When he first moved to the square in 1985, the property would cost £65,000 on average. A huge 1,042 per cent increase since then means despite he is now sitting on £743,000.Yet the average small business owner only takes home around £29,000 a year, meaning he would be some way short of the £148,609 minimum income required to secure a mortgage were he to buy the same house today.  Ken Barlow (left) first appeared on the soap in 1960. Right: his home on Coronation StreetCharlie Fairfield has been a prominent figure in Casualty since 1986, and the average semi-detached property in Bristol has increased from £43,845 to £474,225 - a staggering increase of 982 per cent. Yet Charlie\u0027s modern-day NHS wage of £26,252 means he would be priced out of the market by more than £68,000, meaning his annual income would have to be £94,845 in order to be accepted for a mortgage. Emmerdale\u0027s Eric Pollard would also struggle to get his foot on the housing ladder today, as a detached house in Arncliff has increased by more than 2,000 per cent in value since he arrived on the show in 1986.          Each soap stars average salary for their job, required income for a mortgage now and the affordability gap between what they earn and need for a mortgage Based on the average income of B\u0026ampB owners, Eric would be nearly £63,000 short of the £91,937 income required to secure a mortgage.  The longest-serving soap star included on the fitures, Christine Barford of the Archers, would have been on around £54,000 as a stable owner before she retired.Having bought in 1953 for little over £2,000, the price of a detached home in Cutnall Green would have increased by 21,355 per cent today.Yet were she to buy today, she would be just over £44,000 of the £98,992 needed to secure a mortgage.          Eric Pollard, as played by Chris Chittell, would struggle to afford his property if he were buying it today  The Grange Bed and Breakfast in Emmerdale The same goes for Tony Hutchinson, Ken Barlow, Jac Naylor and Hywel Llywelyn, who would all be priced out of their respective local markets if they tried to buy today.  Only Jimmi Clay could afford his property today with his GP salary of nearly £70,000 when securing a mortgage in Birmingham. Alastair McKee, Managing Director of One77 Mortgages, commented: \u0027Unfortunately for our best-loved soap stars, the cost of getting on the ladder today would see many of them resigned to the rental sector.           Graphic shows the average price when the characters moved into their home compared to what it is in the current housing climate          Only Jimmi Clay could afford to buy the property he now lives in, according to new figures\u0027Luckily for them, they took that first step when prices weren\u0027t as high and as a result have benefited from some very healthy price growth across the board. \u0027Of course, this research is just a bit of fun and in many cases mortgage affordability would be bolstered by a partner or spouses\u0027 income, but it does raise a more serious issue. \u0027Regardless of property type, profession and location, there is a huge disparity between the price of UK property and the wages on offer and it highlights the struggle facing many aspirational buyers today when trying to secure a mortgage.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Fracking firm claim strict red tape prevents tapping rich reservoir shale gas","story":"    Fracking firm Cuadrilla\u0027s Preston Road fracking site is seen near Blackpool, where they say a \u0027rich reservoir\u0027 of gas is presentThe company has written to its regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), to call for a review of the rules.

The company says it has not been able to complete part of the fracking process – injecting sand after water has been pumped in – without breaching the threshold.Chief executive Francis Egan called for the limit to be raised but did not say where he wants the tremor level to be set.‘All we ask now is that we are treated fairly, with comparable seismic and ground vibration levels to similar industries in Lancashire and elsewhere in the UK,’ he said.

When he first moved to the square in 1985, the property would cost £65,000 on average. A huge 1,042 per cent increase since then means despite he is now sitting on £743,000.Yet the average small business owner only takes home around £29,000 a year, meaning he would be some way short of the £148,609 minimum income required to secure a mortgage were he to buy the same house today.  Ken Barlow (left) first appeared on the soap in 1960. Right: his home on Coronation StreetCharlie Fairfield has been a prominent figure in Casualty since 1986, and the average semi-detached property in Bristol has increased from £43,845 to £474,225 - a staggering increase of 982 per cent. Yet Charlie\u0027s modern-day NHS wage of £26,252 means he would be priced out of the market by more than £68,000, meaning his annual income would have to be £94,845 in order to be accepted for a mortgage. Emmerdale\u0027s Eric Pollard would also struggle to get his foot on the housing ladder today, as a detached house in Arncliff has increased by more than 2,000 per cent in value since he arrived on the show in 1986.          Each soap stars average salary for their job, required income for a mortgage now and the affordability gap between what they earn and need for a mortgage Based on the average income of B\u0026ampB owners, Eric would be nearly £63,000 short of the £91,937 income required to secure a mortgage.  The longest-serving soap star included on the fitures, Christine Barford of the Archers, would have been on around £54,000 as a stable owner before she retired.Having bought in 1953 for little over £2,000, the price of a detached home in Cutnall Green would have increased by 21,355 per cent today.Yet were she to buy today, she would be just over £44,000 of the £98,992 needed to secure a mortgage.          Eric Pollard, as played by Chris Chittell, would struggle to afford his property if he were buying it today  The Grange Bed and Breakfast in Emmerdale The same goes for Tony Hutchinson, Ken Barlow, Jac Naylor and Hywel Llywelyn, who would all be priced out of their respective local markets if they tried to buy today.  Only Jimmi Clay could afford his property today with his GP salary of nearly £70,000 when securing a mortgage in Birmingham. Alastair McKee, Managing Director of One77 Mortgages, commented: \u0027Unfortunately for our best-loved soap stars, the cost of getting on the ladder today would see many of them resigned to the rental sector.           Graphic shows the average price when the characters moved into their home compared to what it is in the current housing climate          Only Jimmi Clay could afford to buy the property he now lives in, according to new figures\u0027Luckily for them, they took that first step when prices weren\u0027t as high and as a result have benefited from some very healthy price growth across the board. \u0027Of course, this research is just a bit of fun and in many cases mortgage affordability would be bolstered by a partner or spouses\u0027 income, but it does raise a more serious issue. \u0027Regardless of property type, profession and location, there is a huge disparity between the price of UK property and the wages on offer and it highlights the struggle facing many aspirational buyers today when trying to secure a mortgage.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle calls Meghan bulls story imaginary pals praised princess","story":"    Brave: Meghan Markle (above last Friday) was praised in a glowing People profile that featured interviews with five anonymous friends who were tired of seeing the princess be bullied          Counterpoint: \u0027#PeopleMagazine this article is total bulls*** there are plenty of text messages and receipts to prove otherwise.

A. Milne\u0027s poem Now We Are Six ends: \u0027But now I am six, I\u0027m as clever as clever. So I think I\u0027ll be six now for ever and ever.\u0027 That\u0027s how I felt that day. Over subsequent decades my \u0027spirit age\u0027 was mostly far older than my real vintage.The first LP I bought, aged 12, from the Cirencester branch of FW Woolworth, was Bach\u0027s Brandenburg Concertos. As a teenager I ached to wear baggy corduroys and smoke a pipe. I have owned only one pair of jeans and they were not a success.          Quentin Letts says his spirit age is around one year older than his actual age At university in Ireland I hated the pressure to be \u0027with it\u0027 and dated a beautiful Belfast artist who was ten years my senior. As a 30-year-old reporter, I envied older journalists who had seen the world and mastered their craft.When I married Lois in 1996, I knew she was a cracker yet felt itchy when grannies cooed over us as \u0027love\u0027s young dream\u0027 and told us: \u0027It\u0027s all in front of you.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to be young. I wanted to be established, successful, my own man, with a lawnmower and a drinks cabinet and shoe-trees.Now I\u0027ve got them and it feels right.In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky writes that 56 is the age at which real life can begin: a \u0027fine complexion, sound though discoloured teeth, a stocky, solid figure, a preoccupied air in the morning, a gay face in the evening\u0027.There is also, though this he omitted, a disposition to pity anyone younger, and a sense of relief to have left behind youth\u0027s gulping gawkishness. Thank heavens for middle age.EVEN AT 56 I STILL GET SCHOOLGIRL CRUSHESSusannah ConstantineReal age: 56. Spirit age: 16.          Susannah Constantine \u0027still get schoolgirl crushes\u0027So, Christie Brinkley jokes that she\u0027s turning 50 for the 15th time, declaring her spirit age is far younger than her 65 years. Why has she chosen an age that is ten years older than she looks?When it comes to how I feel, I\u0027d put it at somewhere around 16. I still get schoolgirl crushes and it would be wonderful to have no responsibilities. Often, I see myself in my children and it makes me laugh when I tell them to behave or grow up, when inside I\u0027m wanting to do exactly the same as them, despite the statins, hot flushes and insomnia.I yearn to eat rubbish as often as I like without pumping up the cholesterol levels. I\u0027d love to be able to sleep until noon. It would be heaven to have a night on the tiles and not look like stale bread the next morning.Sadly, at the ripe old age of 56, it would be unwise to live my spiritual age because it could take me to an early grave.    Henry Deedes\u0027s spirit age is the age he got married My spirit age — 28 — is the age I got married. That\u0027s not a dig at my ex-wife, we had many wonderful times. Still do. But I feel younger now than I did then.Midlife complacency set in prematurely after marrying. The burden of responsibility meant I neglected myself.Week nights covering the canape-and-Krug party circuit had left my skin sallow, my belly blubberous. Home life was often a whir of bills and builders as I tottered under the weight of a mortgage bigger than the Brexit orce fee.These days, I eat better, drink less and am mildly more solvent. Frequent exercise means I can wear T-shirts again without feeling like a lager-tummied extra from Benidorm. That feeling of youthful spontaneity is wonderful. I have a sense of adventure again.Every now and again I get a quick reality check. Hangovers get harder. Hair gets greyer. And yesterday I ordered a hip support from Amazon to wear in the gym — but let\u0027s not dwell on that.CHILDREN CAN TELL I\u0027M NOT A GROWN-UPRowan PellingReal age: 51. Spirit age: 15.I have never lied about my age and told everyone when I turned 50 last year. But that might be because I am certain, deep down, that the largest part of me remains resolutely 15.          Rowan Pelling never lied about her age I have spent my life avoiding certain adult responsibilities (tax returns, form-filling, housework, the duller side of childrearing) and veering off into my own vivid, imaginary world.I still make the kind of intense friendships I made at school and like sloping away from chores like a naughty schoolgirl having a ciggie behind the bike sheds.My life would have fallen apart, I suspect, if I hadn\u0027t married a proper grown-up who provides the necessary domestic balance. I happily wear clothes many peers would judge to be age-inappropriate, such as skinny jeans, short skirts and bikinis, and only yesterday I received a Sex Pistols T-shirt in the post.Children (little girls in particular) often recognise I\u0027m not a real grown-up and are happy to talk to me about unicorns, imaginary friends and dragons. If there\u0027s a trampoline or a game of \u0027It\u0027, I\u0027m first in the queue.My chief guilty pleasure is nestling in an armchair with a clutch of favourite children\u0027s books.I don\u0027t think I chase youth: I\u0027ve never had Botox or filler and I\u0027m happy with my wrinkles. But I suspect feeling young is what makes a person buzz, not looking it. If I were ever to have a tattoo, then it would say simply: \u0027There are no rules.\u0027IN MY DREAMS I\u0027M 17 AND A RUGBY HEROStanley JohnsonReal age: 78. Spirit age: 17.          Stanley Johnson dreams of being a rugby hero Even now, I dream about my schooldays when I played prop in rugby for Sherborne, aged 17.The other side (Marlborough? Clifton?) kicks off. I catch the ball full-toss and charge straight for the line, looking neither right nor left, to score under the posts.Of course, I\u0027m not arguing that the grit and determination you acquire on the rugger field as a schoolboy is the end of the story. Yes, I wanted to gain a rugger blue at Oxford after I left school, but I also wanted to get a First and be President of the Union.As it happened, I flunked all three goals, but there was one great consolation prize which I have cherished all my life: I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a 98-line poem called May Morning. I had to recite it at the university\u0027s summer prize-giving ceremony, Encaenia.Charlie Chaplin was one of those honoured that year. He signed my programme and, 56 years later, I still have it.In a nutshell, my spirit age still hovers around 17. I have the sense that even though I hung up my boots years ago, it\u0027s worth charging full-tilt towards the goal.BEING A YOUNG DAD WAS THE BEST TIMERay ConnollyReal age: 78. Spirit age: 29.Emotionally frozen at the age of 29, that\u0027s what I was. That\u0027s how I still think of myself.It was the age when I became confident that I knew how to do what I was good at.We bought a big, run-down house on my 29th birthday in 1970 and it felt like a new beginning, setting off on a new adventure with a future rich in hope and possibilities.          Ray Connolly is \u0027frozen at the age of 29\u0027That was also the time when I was a young father. I liked the role of being a dad — I still do. Not the sort of dad who helped much around the house, more the type who saw children as people to amuse and who enjoyed being amused by them.I expect lots of men identify with being in their late teens — which suggests to me they must have had more success with girls at that age than I did. Marrying Plum when I was 25 was the best thing I ever did. We\u0027ve grown old together, but still reckon the years when the children were small were the best.It was hard, of course. Not much money, two children and soon another on the way, redecorating all four floors of our home in the evenings — Wedgwood blue and white panels nearly everywhere.Not everything has turned out as I hoped. There have been some mistakes — like selling that perfect house — and setbacks. But I\u0027m still happily working seven days a week, still getting new ideas and beginning new projects. Still feeling all of 29.WE GRANNIES ARE FULL OF ENERGYLynne FranksReal age: 70. Spirit age: 30.I have been in my early 30s for almost 40 years. Although clearly my body is older, my enthusiasm for new projects and my energy are the same, and my creativity is as full-on.          Lynne Franks has \u0027been in my early 30s for almost 40 years\u0027At 70, I am opening three new businesses, have moved to a new home in Somerset where I\u0027ve never lived before, and am still optimistic about love and romance.I know good health is vital to keeping up my energy and I eat well, take the best natural supplements and stay as physically active as I have time for, with regular boxing sessions, daily dog walks, tennis lessons and dancing.But I think it\u0027s my love of life and excitement for what each day will bring that keep me feeling less than half my biological age.I meet so many women in my work as a coach and mentor who are my age and planning their next career. It\u0027s as if being grandmothers and well past the menopause has given us a new lease of life.Laughter, love, creative ideas, hugs and a belief that we can work together to create a new and better kind of world is what keeps me and my friends spiritually 30.IS IT TIME I FOUND A PROPER JOB?Libby PurvesReal age: 69. Spirit age: 27.If you\u0027re a freelance, your spirit age stays shamefully young. Actors and musicians know the feeling, too, and I suspect a lot of us still unconsciously feel about 27.It\u0027s understandable: you have never been a serious employee, corporate executive or brisk office manager never been eligible for a company pension, sick pay, maternity leave or an unfair-dismissal tribunal. So you roam the landscape as bright-eyed and wary as a weasel.          Libby Purves says freelancing keeps you \u0027shamefully young\u0027You always wonder about the next contract or the next gig, and never mind being busy you remember how the young Roy Hudd, complaining of overwork, was told by a grand, old, end-of-the-pier agent: \u0027Roy, a full date-book is a happy pro!\u0027You rather relish the sense of adventure involved in professional insecurity, wondering who might try to hire you next and if you would match up to their style, or be able to tolerate the management\u0027s notorious attitude problem.Like a twentysomething between boyfriends, you have a giddy sense that something intriguing and wonderful might be just around the corner.

Cuadrilla had to pause work several times late last year after tremors exceeded the 0.5 limit. The company says it has not been able to complete part of the fracking process – injecting sand after water has been pumped in – without breaching the threshold.Chief executive Francis Egan called for the limit to be raised but did not say where he wants the tremor level to be set.‘All we ask now is that we are treated fairly, with comparable seismic and ground vibration levels to similar industries in Lancashire and elsewhere in the UK,’ he said.

Cyberbullying, online predators, harassment and disturbing content have all been identified as dangers for children online, with experts warning of the impact on mental health – especially when combined with poor sleep and a lack of exercise.Dame Sally said: \u0027Time spent online can be of great benefit to children and young people, providing opportunities for learning and skills development, as well as allowing young people to find support and information.\u0027But we need to take a precautionary approach and our advice will support children to reap these benefits and protect them from harm.\u0027Experts last night welcomed the guidance as simple, straightforward and achievable.       The family of schoolgirl Molly Russell have found it \u0027impossible\u0027 to discover potentially vital information about what she viewed online in the hours before she killed herself.Her parents – who have accused social media companies of contributing to her death – have been unable to gain access to both her Apple iPhone and iPod Touch, which are both encrypted.They have also been hamstrung by efforts to access the 14-year-old\u0027s social media accounts, which do not become accessible to parents even if a child dies.Molly\u0027s father Ian Russell told the BBC: \u0027There is data on her electronic devices that we can\u0027t access because it is locked in there.

The stakes could hardly be higher. An amicable orce that is not destructive, or a messy break-up which would leave a lot of wreckage behind. There are only 50 days left . . .Which brings me to Martin Selmayr and his zip.Though not much known in this country or even in his native Germany, Selmayr is a big cheese in Brussels, where he serves as Juncker\u0027s deputy. He has a fearsome reputation.Juncker has affectionately called him the \u0027monster\u0027, while less indulgent souls at the European Commission have nicknamed him \u0027Rasputin\u0027 or \u0027Darth Vader\u0027. Visiting British officials have simply called him a \u0027psychopath\u0027.As you\u0027d expect, Selmayr is normally in the second group I\u0027ve mentioned — sticklers who rigidly uphold every jot and tittle of EU rules and regulations, and won\u0027t contemplate any sort of pragmatic compromise with Britain over the backstop.Perhaps he\u0027s still in this camp, along with that inveterate critic of Brexit, Donald Tusk. Yet in a meeting with British MPs in Brussels on Monday, he showed a surprising degree of flexibility.          Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar (left) and the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker are in the hardline EU camp     German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is in the \u0027reasonable camp\u0027 that wants Britain to have an acceptable Brexit dealI\u0027m going to stick out my neck. I predict Brussels will propose some sort of legal guarantee that Britain can\u0027t be made to stay in the Customs Union against its will if no solution to the backstop is forthcoming.The reason I believe this is that the self-interest of democratically elected governments — many of which are appalled by the prospect of No Deal — is likely to triumph over the ideologues at the European Commission.Admittedly, these purists — Juncker, Tusk and Michel Barnier — have made the running during the negotiations as they did their utmost to deliver a punishment beating to Britain that would deter any other country from leaving their fledgling superstate.Donald Tusk admits hopes of holding second referendum to...QUENTIN LETTS: Hell surely has a special shelf for the...Welcome to Hell, Theresa: May heads for Brussels for...ANDREW PIERCE: Donald Tusk\u0027s jibe about a \u0027special place in...Share this articleBut things have changed. In particular, economic conditions in Europe have deteriorated to an extent that wasn\u0027t foreseeable even three months ago. Italy is in recession, while France and Germany are teetering on the edge of one.One could say that Britain is fortunate to be negotiating with Brussels when the EU is suddenly and unexpectedly weak. Theresa May, despite her recent tribulations, may be inely blessed.Although no one can be sure what the effect of No Deal would be, there have been many studies suggesting it could precipitate already floundering economies, including Germany\u0027s, into a severe recession.Who would want that? Not elected leaders, obviously. Not Angela Merkel, who has been listening to petrified German car-makers — already weakened by the collapse in diesel car sales, and the looming threat of stiff U.S. tariffs.Britain is their biggest single market. About one in seven cars manufactured in Germany is sold in this country. The tariffs which would follow No Deal are the last thing they need.          President of the European Council, Donald Tusk (right) and Prime Minister of Ireland Leo Varadkar during a press statement after a meeting on Brexit in Brussels yesterday And France? Despite all the posturing of that preening narcissist Emmanuel Macron, I can\u0027t believe he really wants irate French farmers marching down the Champs-Elysees complaining that British markets are closed to them.Mrs Merkel\u0027s attempts at conciliation over recent days suggest that at long last Europe\u0027s politicians are publicly flexing their muscles, and are unlikely to allow Brussels dogmatic bureaucrats to call the tune.Indeed, Martin Selmayr\u0027s deftness with zips is probably evidence of this. He has close links with the ruling Christian Democrats in Berlin. Isn\u0027t it likely that this normally obdurate EU functionary is being leaned on by the German government?So I repeat my prediction that a significant concession on the backstop will be offered by the EU over the next few weeks. Ireland\u0027s hysterical concerns over its border with Northern Ireland won\u0027t be allowed to plunge Europe into recession.But will such a final deal be accepted by the hard-line Brexiteers? And the Democratic Unionists? There, I am far less sure. We have our own hardcore of purists and ideologues who may be more doctrinaire than their counterparts in Brussels.Martin Selmayr is unzipping. Even the sepulchral Donald Tusk, with his repeated abominations of Brexit, will probably be side-lined by real-life politicians.But our own ultras? How bitterly ironic it will be if, in the home of moderation and good sense, compromise and pragmatism do not prevail."},{"url":null,"title":"Speeding Navy cadets clocked 99 points just four months them","story":"    Two Qatari naval officer cadets clocked up 99 speeding points but failed to turn up in Newton Abbot Magistrates’ CourtHe was found guilty and fined a total of £7,810, ordered to pay a £77 victim surcharge and £85 costs.He racked up a total of 61 points on his licence and was banned from driving for four years.Al-Mahmoud was charged with 10 counts between April and June 2018, one of which was driving at 97mph in a 70mph zone on Haldon Hill near Exeter, Devon.He was found guilty and fined a total of £4,840, ordered to pay a £77 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

Daniel then becomes obsessed with her, instilling himself as her boyfriend and the central character in her new life.

As well as being extremely funny, they work as a highly entertaining history lesson - even down to the way people spoke in the mid-to-late nineteenth century2manyb00ks is enjoying The Lightning Men by Thomas Mullen, the second in the Darktown series:Crime fiction set in 1950 in Atlanta when African Americans have just joined the police force. The crime part is great but what is really interesting is how society is shifting and changing. The three main characters are well drawn and all making compromises between the law, their ethics and their families.Frontier by Can Xue has impressed Will1900:A vast, strangely ambiguous tale of people who find themselves in a dreamlike frontier town in China. Of all of her books, this one felt most like a collection of folk tales, run through with mysticism, and strange natural phenomena- for all its modernity it felt like discovering an ancient text.Yosserian has just finished Patrimony: A True Story, by Philip Roth:A memoir about his father, Herman Roth, and his death from a brain tumour. Roth has a straightforward way of telling the story of father and son, eschewing prose fireworks, as so far has all of his books I’ve read. It is poignant, and at times wryly funny. A commenter on Goodreads said that Roth showed how to be a good son. That despite Roth junior, or perhaps because of, being so keen to leave home and Roth senior, and establish his independence, he is able to loop back, and be there for his father later in life.Finally, a (beautifully written) confession by nosuchzone:I quite like being the last possible reader of a paperback - I bought the orange-banded Penguins that Margery Allingham wrote during wartime (it was a sudden interest) and, like the blitz-zones of London, Coventry, etc, they cracked at the spines, shedding pages, or clumps of them, as the reading progressed. The desiccated glue, that powders your fingers as you brush it’s scales aside, has a faintly seaweedy smell, I noticed. They’re still on a shelf, albeit lain flat (they wouldn’t hold together stood upright - ah, it comes to us all).Me, I buy second-hand cloth-bound hardcovers if I can and almost always throw the dust jackets away at once. What I like to read most is an old hardback that’s long lost it’s jacket, and has, at some point in its long life, been left skew-whiff on a pile near a window for a summer or two - so that the sun-bleaching of the cloth on the front cover is a rhomboid ghost-margin to its darker interior. Preferably in Trafalgar Blue, as it was called. It adds a spiritual dimension. Well, I find it does.You throw the dust jackets away?! Makes me wonder what else people do to their poor books.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He’s also a Breton. So when he decided to leave his top ision team to join a small team based in Brittany for the 2018 season, most of his countrymen offered understanding Gallic nods. After all, cycling is in the blood of residents of this north-west region in France. Neighbouring Normandy isn’t far behind in its love of all things two-wheeled. And it’s little wonder – there are few areas better suited to exploration from the saddle.With hundreds of kilometres of voies vertes – greenways accessible only to those on two wheels, two feet, or a horse – there are plenty of options for families as well as Lycra-clad fanatics.Each of these routes is easily accessible from Cherbourg, Le Havre or Caen. So grab your bike, hop on the ferry, and get ready for some truly memorable cycling adventures.Cherbourg to Querqueville and back (nine miles14.5km)Best for: families looking for a safe and easy route to peddle.Highlights: stunning views out to sea.Start near La Cité de la Mer – Cherbourg’s maritime museum and well worth a visit – and take the cycle path alongside Boulevard de La Saline towards Querqueville. Enjoy the beach, and then head back the way you came.Ouistreham to Caen (10 miles16km)Best for: those who want to get on their bikes as soon as they get off the ferry.Highlights: the Musée Mémorial Pegasus commemorating the British soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division. Their capture of a bridge over the canal was a crucial strategic victory during the Normandy landings.This path is entirely along a signposted greenway, from Caen’s ferry port into the city itself, and will only take an hour or two to cover. It forms the opening portion of La Vélo Francette cycle route, which runs to La Rochelle.Caen to Bayeux via Juno beach and Arromanches (28.5 miles46km)Best for: the more confident cyclist, as much of the route is along shared roads.Highlights: arromanches 360° circular cinema, which tells the story of the Battle of Normandy.From Caen, take the cycle path north to Langrune-sur-Mer. Then head west along the coast towards Courseulles-sur-Mer, home to Juno beach on which Canadian forces landed during D-Day – a museum there commemorates their heroism. Then it’s the D112B south towards Crépon, then north towards Arromanches. From there, take the D87 to Bayeux – home to the famed 70 metre-long Bayeux Tapestry, and only seven miles away.Cherbourg to Carentan (34 miles55km)Best for: cyclists who are growing in confidence.Highlights: the wildlife-filled marshlands of the Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin.This is an established and well-signposted route, with no shortage of history along the way. It takes in the medieval cobbled town of La Haye-du-Puits and the châteaux ruins of Brix and Bricquebec.Ouistreham to Domfront (62 miles100km)Best for: confident cyclists, thanks to some steep sections.Highlights: the gorges of the Orne Valle, which offer multiple photo opportunities.This is the first full section of La Vélo Francette and offers its share of undulating terrain. From Caen it’s on to Thury-Harcourt, then the riverside village of Pont-d’Ouilly, Flers – home to a very pretty château – and finally on to historic Domfront, with its 11th-century castle.La Véloroute du Littoral de la Côte d’Albâtre: Le Havre to Le Tréport (about 100miles160km)Highlights: the stunning coastal views.This route follows the Alabaster Coast, with glorious views rewarding those confident enough to take on its undulations. It passes through Étretat – which provided inspiration for impressionist painters including Claude Monet – as well as Fécamp, home to a Benedictine abbey and a useful option for an overnight stay.Tour de Manche: Cherbourg to Roscoff (440miles708km)Best for: experienced riders who want a multi-stage adventure.Highlights: Mont St-Michel, Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin and the waterfalls in Mortain are all glorious.You may not quite be ready for the Tour de France, but how about the Tour de Manche, a cycling adventure that links France and England? This 754mile1200km circular route includes parts of Dorset and Devon, or try the French section running from Cherbourg to Roscoff. It is split into stages – Cherbourg to Carentan is the first portion, and uses quiet roads and greenways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac75f457503a87ad7074e8eaa2c2e0d74cb972c/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9005c36c281f0bd3f1514afc1e902cd","title":"the best food and where to find it in normandy and brittany","story":"Famed for their cider, cheese, seafood and charcuterie, Normandy and Brittany are two of France’s premier food regions. Foodies read on …MarketsAcross France, Normandy is esteemed for its abundance of quality produce and rich gastronomic history. Dozens of traditional markets showcase the best of these, with further specialist markets dedicated to fish, organic produce and local crafts. Whatever the day of the week, wherever you happen to be, you’ll never be far from one.Perhaps the most picturesque of these is to be found in the medieval “halles” in Dives-sur-Mer on a Monday. You can wander around the 14th-century half-timbered building, which is packed to bursting with stalls, and chat to dozens of local producers. Sundays in Trouville-sur-Mer are equally popular with locals and visitors looking for top-notch fresh bread, cheeses, meat and charcuterie – local farmers lay out their vegetables and homemade preserves, vinegar and pickles, too.In the surrounds of glamorous Deauville, regular gourmet food markets take place at Place du Marché (Tuesday, Friday, Saturday) and the abundant high-end restaurants and Parisian-style cafes are ripe for celeb-spotting during Deauville’s American film festival in September. If poisson is your passion, Trouville, the adjacent 17th-century port town, boasts a daily market on the quay with numerous terrace cafes and grills for feasting on seafood.Rouen and the Seine valley are renowned for the quality of their markets. For cheeses, fish and seafood, and local specialities such as pressed duck, check out Clos Saint-Marc (Saturday), Vieux-Marché (Sun-Fri and brocante or flea market on Saturday) and les Emmurées (Tuesday, Saturday) and the 250-stall Sotteville-les-Rouen (Thursday, Sunday).Regional specialities and where to sample themDairy herds were introduced to Normandy by the Vikings and the region has long produced world-class cheeses for the Paris market. You can buy camembert, Livarot, Pont-l’Evêque and Neufchâtel in shops and supermarkets, but to try small-batch artisan cheeses, head for the markets and specialist fromageries – notably in the Pays d’Auge and smaller Le Pays de Bray regions. At Isigny sur Mer, west of Caen, you can also enjoy a tour and tasting at Sainte Mére cheese factory.As you’d expect, the coastal towns and villages are awash with fabulous fish and seafood. Inland, look out for exceptional beef and veal, and the duck – canard de Rouen – appears on lots of menus.If you’ve a sweet tooth, don’t visit the region without trying a traditional tarte Normande, a rich shortcrust pastry tart filled with creamy egg custard and almonds, and topped with slices of caramelised apple. RestaurantsSmart, family-friendly eateries serving simple, seasonal produce are plentiful in Normandy. For fresh “surf and turf” with a sensational sea view, Hôtel des Isles in Barneville-Carteret, just south of Cherbourg, offers a land and sea starter buffet with seafood platters, grilled or plancha-seared fish and traditional stewed meats for main.If you’re after a traditional experience inland, try Brasserie Paul in Rouen where fresh regional specialities such as rabbit pâté, Normandy snails, local farm chicken and fine cheeses are on the menu.Rouen also offers stylish two-Michelin-starred dining at Gill – pigeon is a speciality – or the more affordable but still sleekly decorated sister restaurant, Gill Côté Bistro.DrinkingCalvados (apple brandies) and cider are the region’s two signature drinks. Three controlled appellations produce the former, one of which is Pays d’Auge, where copper alembic pot stills are used. On the 25-mile (40km) cider route east of Caen, you can visit more than 20 establishments producing one or both of these, as well as pommeau – made by mixing apple juice with brandy. Many of the distilleries and cidermakers occupy picture-postcard houses set amid apple orchards and lush pastures.MarketsFrom the bustling Sunday market at Carnac to Vannes’s fish market (four days a week, as well as a traditional market on Wednesdays) to the astonishing 20 neighbourhood markets that are spread around Rennes, Brittany is a region brimming with food and produce, crafts and culture. Whether you’re looking for crisp apples and freshly picked strawberries or more gastro items such as rare poultry and artisanal butters, you’ll find them on a stall – Breton chefs do their shopping here … and they know a thing or two.At charming Pontivy, by the river Blavet and the Nantes-to-Brest canal, you can drop in at the Monday market before exploring the medieval castle and the maze of winding streets. The town also has a thriving antiques trade and there are regular flea markets.Quaint Bécherel, between Saint-Malo and Rennes, has a buzzing Saturday food and household goods market and is also one of France’s best-loved book towns. There are more than a dozen bookshops, a book market on the first Sunday of the month and a lively schedule of literary events, including a fête du livre (book fair) every Easter.In the summer months, you can find night markets in Carnac and Quiberon, and enjoy classic Breton musical entertainment with bombarde (woodwind) players while you browse.Regional specialities and where to sample themIf you’re self-catering in Brittany you’re in luck. With 1,740 miles of coastline, you can pick up some of the best fish and shellfish in Europe. Brittany is the powerhouse of France’s oyster trade, providing one-third of the nation’s yield – Cancale is its capital. Look out, too, for delicious mussels, scallops, clams, lobster, and langoustines, as well as more exotic items such as organic abalones.Breton producers are very proud of their pork – saucissons of all kinds abound, while audouille – a sausage made from smoked chitterling – has its semi-official capital in Guéméné-sur-Scorff. Across the region, look out for local onions and organic honey.If you’re big on pastry, kouign amann – which translates as “butter cake” – is a Breton speciality. Created in 1860 in the town of Douarnenez, this gooey, layered confection is sold by weight in traditional patisseries the very definition of “naughty but nice”.RestaurantsIf ever you’re in need of a tasty snack between meals, a regional comfort food is the crepe, both the sweet kind and savoury galettes. They are served in restaurants and occasionally on the street. At the Creperie Ti Saozon, in Roscoff, chef Estelle Combot prepares sublime crepes with fish, as well as dessert crepes that get even the locals queuing around brunchtime.Seafood restaurants dot the coast. La Côte, close to Carnac’s famous menhirs, occupies a large, old house in a delightful setting, with a terrace overlooking a carp-filled pond. Try the squid with pig’s trotters or the lobster.L’Amphytrion in Lorient has two Michelin stars and a chic ambience. Acclaimed chef Jean-Paul Abadie creates fine art with spider crab, mackerel, sea urchins and local fish such as red mullet.DrinkingCider is the “wine” of Brittany. Cornouaille was the first French cider to be recognised with an appellation controlee label. Look out for the 10 AOC cider-makers and six non-AOC producers listed on the CIDREF website. Le Sistrot in Quimper stocks a wide range of craft and farm ciders.There’s also a long tradition of beer brewing in the region. Brasserie Lancelot was founded in 1990 and occupies the site of a gold mine in Roc-Saint-André, Morbihan. Seven unpasteurised beers are made here, each one named after a figure from Breton history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba07a288b0ea336fb144bb210ee79844c947324/733_0_3263_1958/master/3263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a130de45f33a9ac70e95b95b63d7a47b","title":"clear him out palestinian tenants struggle to rent in west jerusalem","story":"In this ided city, an Arabic name can severely limit the ability to find a home – and anti-discrimination laws don’t cover private housingThe new housemate seemed perfect. A young professional from Jerusalem, fluent in multiple languages, he gelled well with the other tenants. After a short sublet, he asked to be officially added to the lease so he could apply for a parking permit.The landlord became angry and refused. The would-be-housemate had a distinctly Arabic name and the landlord said he wouldn’t rent to a Palestinian. In a text message to one of the other housemates, a British-Israeli teacher, the landlord wrote that he didn’t want a “non-Jew” renting and ordered them to “clear him out as soon as possible”. When the housemates pushed back, the landlord threatened to come with his brothers, change the locks and throw them out.“I was shocked,” says the teacher, but their Palestinian would-be housemate wasn’t. He declined to speak on the record or file a complaint. “What do you expect?” the teacher recalled him saying. “This is Jerusalem.”Like many Palestinians, he had experienced suspicion and racism before in Jewish-majority west Jerusalem. Facing discrimination is common for Palestinians trying to rent apartments on the well-maintained west side of the city. Sometimes it’s an upfront “No Arabs” directive from the landlord, but more often it is harder to pinpoint not getting a call back once an Arabic name comes up, for example.A few years back, Lustingman was leaving an apartment in west Jerusalem before the lease ended and needed a replacement. Luckily a friend, a Palestinian doctor, was interested. He had a guarantor and all the paperwork ready.“The landlord would not accept him as a tenant,” Lustingman says. “He wouldn’t allow a Palestinian person to move there … He’d rather the house stay empty.”She offered to represent her friend in a legal battle, which he declined. “He just wanted to find a different place to live.”Of these four Palestinian statuses, two – Palestinian citizens of Israel and east Jerusalem residents – feel the impact of Jerusalem’s housing dynamics.Given this labyrinthine question of status, as well as the history and ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, the two populations are often fearful of mingling. Palestinian suicide bombers in the mid-2000s brought everyday life in west Jerusalem to a halt, and since 2015 there have been waves of Palestinian stabbings. Many Israelis describe Jerusalem as the kind of city where the three main communities – Jewish Israelis, Palestinians, and ultra-religious Jews – prefer to live separately. The Israeli public was elated when US president Donald Trump moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May last year, effectively endorsing Israel’s position that Jerusalem is its unided capital. Palestinians, however, also claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.Amid these political battles, unofficial housing discrimination remains an effective way to keep the population ided as Israel’s right-wing government attempts to extend its dominance over Jerusalem.A number of lawyers and human rights groups contacted say they are not aware of any legal cases contesting this kind of housing discrimination.“It is difficult to prove,” Lustingman adds. “That’s part of the problem. Usually people will see the name and they won’t say directly that this is the reason … There is no direct straightforward test to this.”While Israeli law directly forbids race, gender and other discrimination in areas such as employment and public space, there is no direct prohibition in relation to private housing. There is, however, a basic premise under Israeli law which stipulates that a contract must be negotiated in good faith – and Lustingman says a lawyer could argue housing discrimination violates this.Estate agent Eva Aviad says there are some areas of west Jerusalem, such as the mixed neighbourhood of Abu Tor, where Palestinians would not face problems renting, adding that she has never encountered a landlord refusing to let to an Arab client.“Most of the landlords that I work with are liberal, excuse me for being so frank,” she says. “The trouble is in this country – and especially in Jerusalem, where you really feel the conflict – is it is hard to be a liberal.”Muhammad, 28, a Hebrew-speaking Palestinian raised in the Old City in east Jerusalem, requested that the  only use his first name. He says he has lived in west Jerusalem for several years but for the past few months has been hunting for a new apartment – and is finding it difficult. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of the city are entirely off limits, he says, and he doesn’t want to live on a street where he’s the only Arab.But Muhammad needs to keep living in Jerusalem to maintain his residency. And as a young person looking for freedom, he doesn’t want to live in the Old City – “the bubble,” he calls it – where Israeli paramilitary police patrol, social norms are conservative, and where his family and neighbours can constantly monitor and restrict his lifestyle.So, before Muhammad goes to meet a potential housemate or landlord, he looks them up on Facebook to try to get a sense of their politics. He then holds his breath for the moment when “you feel something change with them” and he’s told there are others looking or the room is already taken.“Bottom line – I’m still looking for an apartment.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0404cbfcd08f5f8bc42c72be08862810d534bbc/0_120_3418_2051/master/3418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dac045b512fd355d24c0a16949943e91","title":"the guardian view on afghanistan talks hopes for peace but at what cost","story":"Taliban meetings with Afghan powerbrokers, following negotiations with the US, hold out the prospect of an end to this long conflict. But women are especially and rightly concerned about the possible priceAmerica’s longest-running war is edging closer toward a conceivable end. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Donald Trump acknowledged that talks with the Taliban might not succeed, but that “the hour has come to at least try for peace” in Afghanistan, noting his country’s casualties. He did not mention the Afghans who have died (24,000 civilians since 2009, and 45,000 members of the security forces in the last five years), let alone the nation’s broader suffering in the world’s deadliest conflict. Around half of Afghanistan’s population was not born when this war began, in 2001. Their elders have lived with conflict for most of the last four decades, since the Soviet invasion.A country so fissured is united in its longing for peace as last year’s brief ceasefire, in which civilians, militants and soldiers celebrated together, showed. A US-Taliban agreement would be one step along that road. Yet Afghans ask at what cost a deal may come, conscious that those likely to pay the most are not negotiating the bill. Only two women are present at the talks between Taliban representatives and Afghan politicians, warlords and other powerbrokers in Moscow. These follow last month’s talks between US and Taliban negotiators in Qatar, which reached a draft framework under which the US would withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that the country would not harbour terrorists.The considerable obstacles that remain include, most obviously, the Taliban’s refusal to speak to the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and his government. Hope for peace coexists with the fear that the US will leave as carelessly as it boosted intervention in 2017, when civilian deaths surged due to increased air strikes. The Trump administration’s lack of interest in human rights, and the president’s record of contempt for women’s rights, increases those anxieties.Women – and many men too – are frightened about the possible terms of an agreement and very aware that they would essentially be unenforceable once US troops were out of the country. They are rightly frightened that it could dismantle the gains they have made, which fall far short of what is needed – patriarchal values and misogyny are hardly unique to the Taliban – but are nonetheless real, substantive and precious. Research has suggested that peace agreements are more likely to be reached and implemented when women have a strong role in forging them, including – but not only – at the negotiating table. “Any peace that threatens women’s rights, freedoms and gains will not be sustainable,” a group of Afghan women warn in a statement this week. It is in the interests of the Afghan people as a whole that they should be included and heard, and their fundamental rights recognised.

The reason it should be so expensive is that the ring has many functions a gesture of such great love it should cost more than a boiler a symbol of inidual wealth becoming irrelevant as two destinies are conjoined and a signal to the rest of the world of the scale of the catch you have just landed. But if it seemed ridiculous in the 90s, it seems even more outlandish now. Savings are so last century.Poundland recently came to the rescue with a £1 “placeholder” ring: the idea is that you choose your real ring together, but this is a myth, like “first-time buyer”. No one can afford a “real” ring, or a separate wedding ring, least of all when they have to get married. The 20,000 “bling rings” Poundland sold, in a week, will be the rings everyone says “I do” to.I got married, for the second time, less than a year ago. Without going into too much detail about how expensive getting orced is, we were skint. My Mr wanted to get a £20 wedding ring from Argos I wanted a secondhand ring for 20 times that. I won’t say it was the first time we argued, or even the first time we argued that day, but it was definitely the first time he gave me that “who even are you?” look. It is true that I do not seem like the sort of person who would make a rash decision for display purposes – unless it were, I don’t know, buying a Darth Vader suit for a dog.But I knew two things: the first is that nobody ever knows what to say to you when you’ve just got married, so they tell you you look pretty, then they ask to see your ring. I don’t think this happens to men, but it sure as hell happens to women. If you have to do that 50 times, then you will basically spend the whole of your special day talking about Argos. You’ll probably get on to the subject of its tiny pens and its awesome distribution network more than once. That’s not to say a ring doesn’t bring potential negative externalities, since it’s hard to make conversation about adornments per se. I had a friend who said, “I can never believe how cheap antique jewellery is”, then sent me an elaborate apology. At that point, I genuinely was offended that anyone would think I could be offended by someone calling my ring cheap.Second, that ring, unavoidably, becomes sentimental. When Snoop Dogg’s Beautiful is playing because you didn’t bring your own CD, when the registrar is asking you to check the certificate for errors, and you’re saying, “Yes, that’s fine, except you’ve misspelled ‘Southwark’, which is weird, as you have it embroidered on your tie”, that’s the ring you’re in. You will never replace that ring. You might buy another ring, but that will be your original ring. And if it oxidises and turns your finger a bit green, it is still your ring.This doesn’t mean a Poundland ring is a bad idea it’s brilliant. You just need to put FAQs on the invitation, with “Poundland” under “Where did you get your beautiful ring?”, so you don’t spend the day talking about the incredible value of its Halloween decorations. Also, buy seven. Because they might be cheap, but they probably won’t be built to last, even as long as the average marriage.

In contrast, only 18,850 applications came from Wales, meaning that if those trends are sustained there will soon be more undergraduates from China studying at British universities than from Wales.Last year there were also more than 100,000 postgraduate students from China and Hong Kong at British universities, out of nearly 350,000 full-time postgraduates.Overall the numbers will come as a relief to the higher education sector, after widespread concern that the Brexit crisis would erode applications from within the EU and outside Europe.British universities have redoubled their recruitment efforts overseas, while for European applicants it may be their last chance to access lower tuition fees and student loans before Britain exits the EU. International students from outside the EU generally pay much higher fees and are not eligible for loans from the UK government.Clare Marchant, Ucas’s chief executive, said: “‘In this time of uncertainty, it’s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.”Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of British universities, said despite the latest figures the UK risked falling behind rivals such as New Zealand.“We are calling for a new graduate visa that will make the UK more attractive to international students, allowing a wider range of employers in all parts of the UK to benefit from access to talented graduates from around the world,” Jarvis said.“The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study,” Marchant said.The results came against a background of uncertainty over funding, with a review commissioned by Theresa May expected to recommend tuition fees be cut to £6,500-£7,000 from their current level of £9,250.“To drive social mobility and strengthen the economy, the current post-18 education review should recommend policies to support access for anyone who has the potential to benefit from a university education,” said Jarvis.Universities UK this week launched a national campaign asking the government to keep funding study abroad opportunities for British students if the UK cannot remain a member of the pan-European Erasmus student programme after Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03718a88ba7d71186b6d19c7b34ee7a7e402b3e8/137_0_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f904c7e31ac2a67c119acd2371a81055","title":"cavity two thirds the size of manhattan discovered under antarctic glacier","story":"Disintegration of rapidly melting Thwaites ice mass could threaten coastal communities worldwideScientists have discovered a giant cavity at the bottom of a disintegrating glacier in Antarctica, sparking concerns that the ice sheet is melting more rapidly than expected.Researchers working as part of a Nasa-led study found the cavern, which they said was 300 metres tall and two-thirds the size of Manhattan, at the bottom of the massive Thwaites glacier.The space is big enough to have contained 14bn tonnes of ice and most of that ice has melted during the past three years.In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists said the rapid change in the ice was “unexpected” at some points on the glacier.The researchers found the cavity using Italian and German satellites and ice-penetrating radar from Nasa’s Operation IceBridge, which uses research aircraft to monitor changes in polar ice.But Milillo told the  the size of the underwater cavity was not the main concern because the 14bn tonnes it released were already underwater and so would not contribute to sea level rise. The important aspect of the paper, he said, was what it revealed about the interaction between sea and ice.Jeremie Mouginot, a co-author of the paper and a research scientist at the Université Grenoble Alpes, said ocean water was filling a widening gap between the floating ice shelf and the bedrock.Thwaites, he said, was a 120km-wide “monster glacier” that is continuing its retreat with huge future implications, because it could potentially add 0.6 metres to rising seas.Thwaites also supports neighbouring glaciers that, if they melted, would increase sea levels by an additional 2.44 metres, threatening coastal communities worldwide.Mouginot said further studies would be needed on where and how Thwaites will decline. “The current question is not if the glaciers will retreat but at which pace.”There are already new investigations of Thwaites under way, including one by a UK team, as well as studies of other Antarctic regions.The hole is on the glacier’s western side and has been melting at a rate of about 0.6 to 0.8km a year since 1992, a rate that while stable was “extremely high”, Nasa said.Eric Rignot, a co-author of the study, said understanding how warming oceans were melting the glacier away was “essential to project its impact on sea level rise in the coming decades”.“We have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc94478816bde4925c414ae578b98c0506f60340/0_0_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd3b67f759bc24e1c33682ab76b4dd2","title":"uk worst offender in europe for electronic waste exports report","story":"Electronic waste hazardous due to toxic parts was tracked to developing countriesThe UK is the worst offender in Europe for illegally exporting toxic electronic waste to developing countries, according to a two-year investigation that tracked shipments from 10 European countries.The investigation by the environmental watchdog the Basel Action Network (BAN) put GPS trackers on 314 units of computers, LCD monitors and printers placed in recycling facilities in 10 countries. Researchers mapped what they said was the export of 11 items to Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, Thailand and Ukraine. The UK was the top of the list of suspected illegal shipments. Five computers and LCD monitors were shipped to developing countries after they were tracked and placed in council recycling centres across England and Scotland.Ireland, Denmark, Italy, Spain and Germany also exported electronic waste to developing countries in what are suspected to be illegal shipments, the report said.By extrapolating the illegal exports with figures on electronic waste generation throughout Europe, the report estimated that 352,474 metric tonnes of electronic waste was being illegally shipped from the EU to developing countries each year.Jim Puckett, director of BAN, said the illegal shipments perpetuated an EU waste management regime “on the backs of the poor and vulnerable”.“We have discovered a very significant stream of illegal shipments of hazardous consumer electronic scrap to vulnerable populations,” he said.“This flies in the face of EU claims to make continuous efforts to implement a circular economy which can only responsibly exist by eliminating … leakage from the system.”The UK’s shipments went from council recycling facilities to Nigeria, Tanzania and Pakistan.Chris Smith, national intelligence manager for the UK Environment Agency, said: “The Environment Agency takes these matters very seriously with a proactive criminal intelligence led team in place that is dedicated to detecting and preventing illegal waste shipments from England.“However, our challenge is vast. Detecting illegal waste shipments is the ultimate hunt for the needle in a haystack, and this is where partnerships allow us to extend our reach and effectiveness. By providing the Environment Agency with an early insight into their tracker deployment, the Basel Action Network enabled us to quickly and efficiently close down four illegal waste operators who exported the electrical waste containing their trackers.”The report said that due to the lack of proper waste management in the recipient developing countries, including open burning of e-waste, there was likely to be local contamination of crops and threats to humans from the illegal exports.Far more should be done, the study said, to prosecute the robust illegal trade, including working with target countries to stem the toxic tide.Puckett condemned lobbying by the electronics manufacturing industry, which is attempting to create a loophole in the Basel convention to allow broken, low value electronic scrap to flow from Europe on the grounds that it will be “repaired” in developing countries. He urged the EU not to agree to the loophole.“The answer to criminal activity is not legalising that activity but improving the enforcement to ensure the future health of Europe is not dependant on poisoning the rest of the world.”In the last two years the rest of the world has increasingly begun to act against imports of rubbish and waste from Europe. China banned the import of millions of tonnes of plastic waste last year.Thailand – one of the countries to which illegal shipments were found to have been made – acted in June 2018 to stem the flow of e-waste being imported after concerns it was becoming the dumping ground for the world.Other countries have also begun to restrict waste imports from European countries. recently revealed concerns over illegality and fraud in the plastic recycling export industry in the UK as the impact of the import bans created a crisis in UK recycling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c4979d7ea2e0f6202b20b26278514613c1bcc5/178_0_2676_1606/master/2676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6703da6a85aabb2f929ab4eff12274","title":"high flying bird review netflix steven soderbergh","story":"A sharp and layered drama about basketball, filmed on a smartphone, is another slam dunk for both the film-maker and the platform In June 2009 – days before shooting started – director Steven Soderbergh was fired from his film. He had meddled too much with the script. The studio wanted him gone.Moneyball, a back-office drama about the Oakland A’s manager Billy Beane’s quest to revolutionise baseball analytics, was eventually shepherded – by a substitute director, Bennett Miller – to six Oscar nominations. It was a Hollywood success story. But for Soderbergh it was more evidence that Hollywood was failing: another film made in competition with its studio.The director announced his retirement from film-making a few weeks later. “Movies don’t matter any more,” he said. Directors were being treated like dirt.Almost 10 years later. Another revolution. Soderbergh hasn’t changed, but Hollywood has. High Flying Bird, his third film since his return to feature directing in 2017, lands in a new world. A micro-budget Netflix production shot on a smartphone, it’s a very different sports drama, but another story about an innovator upturning the order for the love of the game.André Holland stars as Ray, a basketball agent whose acquisition of the year’s number one draft pick would be a slam-dunk, if only his player was allowed to play. There’s a lockout between the NBA and the athletes, a dispute over pay that has left new recruits like Ray’s client, Erick (Melvin Gregg), sidelined.Ray, a black man looking after the interests of young black men, has to navigate carefully. But, with the help of a sparky former assistant (Zazie Beetz), he takes on the corporations (personified by an ultra-slimy Kyle MacLachlan) and uses their staleness against them. The digital age offers opportunities the old guard have been too slow to tackle. The lockout covers TV broadcast, so streaming platforms are fair game.It’s here that Netflix sub themselves in and it’s this celebration of the company’s own disruptor status where the film fouls up. A particularly clunky scene has Ray, shoring up his client’s confidence in his scheme by proudly announcing that he’s got meetings lined up at Netflix. It plays like a meta love-in between Ray, Soderbergh and the studio, but Netflix – which spent more than $13bn on original productions last year – is too big to claim outlaw status.Still, High Flying Bird makes risky plays. The bold take on race and sport isn’t – and couldn’t be – Soderbergh’s alone. Instead, the film is passed between the director and the screenwriter, Moonlight playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney. His script zips between sports jargon and scripture, analysis and allegory. One sequence has a character draw parallels between professional sport and slavery, then another character quickly ridicule the same. We’re left with Ray’s mentor as our guide and castigator: “Anyone who refers to the institution of slavery in front of me, particularly in reference to basketball and its players, must say these words: ‘I love God and all of his black people.’” Again, this isn’t your typical studio ballgame.The film – with cinematography by Peter Andrews and editing by Mary Ann Bernard (both Steven Soderbergh aliases) – doesn’t always look beautiful. It has a cold blankness, befitting both the soullessness of its subject matter and – perhaps – its $2m budget. It warms up through short interviews the director has filmed with real-life basketball stars Reggie Johnson, Donovan Mitchell and Karl-Anthony Towns, who talk about making the transition from rookie status to the NBA. Filmed as they look up, above the camera, they talk about mistakes, insecurities, family and home. Suddenly, we see them as Ray sees them: as kids. Super-talented, multimillionaire kids, but kids all the same.In picking at a system until it’s threaded, High Flying Bird is a classic Soderbergh construct. Throughout his career – from Sex, Lies and Videotape to Erin Brockovich to Che to Magic Mike – he’s revelled in telling stories of the inidual chipping away at the status quo. Like them, like Ray and like Moneyball’s Billy Beane, Soderbergh sought an alternative to a system that was doing their passion a disservice. The rules have changed, it’s his game now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

A Japanese snack company is offering chips that require only a single hand to consume – and you don’t have to touch the chips at all. The Tokyo company Koike-ya is behind One Hand Chips, which come pre-smashed so that you can essentially drink them, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now you can swipe with clean hands, and while the calories pile up, you don’t have to waste valuable energy chewing. As one enthusiast tells the paper: “I can just take it and chug it.”Koike-ya is aware of the significance of its accomplishment, calling One Hand Chips “a new snack style humankind has been waiting for”, the Journal reports. But it’s far from the first company to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestyles.Nearly a decade ago, TechCrunch reported on the Potato Chip Hand. It’s a plastic stick with pincers on one end, forming a grabber that pleasingly mimics the white gloves favored by Mickey Mouse and Goofy. It emerged just a few years after release of the first iPhone.McDonald’s, meanwhile, has gradually refined its own tools to address the phone-grease conundrum. In 2017, it unveiled the Frork, which is a device to hold and dip French fries. Wooden chip forks are commonplace in the UK, of course – with the life-changing implication that fries can be a meal – but this was different. The beauty of the Frork was how the fries became a part of it, serving as makeshift tines that you could sweep through ketchup. The trouble was loading the holder with fries, which was essentially impossible without touching them, as the writer Tim Carman observed in a series of Washington Post pieces on fry-centric tech.Perhaps that’s why the brilliant minds at McDonald’s rethought the strategy last year. Instead of targeting the fries, they focused on the phone with the Frylus. Your hands might be covered in grease, but the tool allowed you to use your phone without touching it. Had Apple considered this innovation, perhaps the iPhone would have come with one from the start.According to General Mills, makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you shouldn’t have to “choose between eating and posting” selfies, either. The cereal team invented the selfie spoon a few years back, as reported in Time and promoted in this horrifying music video.It’s a selfie stick with a spoon at one end. They are (or were) free – “Our awesome fans love to share their obsession with our cereal on social media so we wanted to show a little love back,” a marketing planner said on the company’s blog – but you do have to cover shipping. SelfieSpoon trumpets the fact that this is “really a thing”. They are sold out, presumably forever, but one is available for $50 on eBay.One-handed eating is not new. Chopsticks predated the Frork by roughly 4,000 years. There are also a number of longstanding snacks well suited to one-handed eating – I personally recommend granola bars. A word of caution, however: you’re probably better off keeping eating and Instagramming separate. Unsurprisingly, researchers have found that using a phone during a meal leads to less enjoyment. Presumably subjects were not using selfie spoons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e7f2b980d5572184198a6e41cff99cf4820593e/0_339_3102_1861/master/3102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3747cbab6a557703e3cda1bb0cfd575b","title":"barcelona real madrid copa del rey match report","story":"• Copa del Rey semi-final first leg: Barcelona 1-1 Real Madrid• Malcom and Lucas Vásquez score in hard-fought drawThere was no Lionel Messi for an hour, no Gareth Bale either, and there was no winner but there were two Brazilians making their clásico debuts and making their mark, taking leading roles on the biggest stage.Vinícius Júnior, 18, made Real Madrid’s opening goal and Malcom, 21, scored Barcelona’s equaliser. If one might have been expected – excitement has been building over Vinícius at the Bernabéu, the sense of the emergence of a new star – the other was not: Malcom’s goal, scored early in the second half, was celebrated with relief as well as joy.His first months in Barcelona have not been easy. His first half here was not, either. But nobody was more involved than he or Vinícius – one on the left wing, the other on the right – and he scored the goal that means the tie hangs in the balance. In the end, with Messi playing only half an hour, there was no way of separating these sides. “There was so much quality out there,” Santiago Solari said after a special night for two Brazilians.Vinícius has led Madrid’s recent revival – enthusiasm running through everything he does and proving contagious, some light amid the darkness – and he led them here as well. Defeated 5-0 last time they came here, this time Madrid were a goal up after five minutes. And it wasn’t even their first attack. Vinícius ran at Nélson Semedo for the second time, shifting the ball on to his right and sending a cross over Jordi Alba to where Karim Benzema was waiting. Benzema pulled back for Lucas Vázquez to score.At every stage of the move, Barcelona arrived a moment too late and in the opening stages that pattern was repeated all over the pitch. There was a tentativeness about them that Madrid took advantage of: Solari’s plan to rob and run, reinforced by the early lead, reaped rewards. Ivan Rakitic was the first man caught out, followed by Philippe Coutinho and Sergio Busquets. Each time, they found Vinícius going at them fearlessly.First, Gerard Piqué had to e to block Vinícius. Next Vinícus scuffed a shot, supplied by Benzema. And then, dashing away, his pull-back just evaded Benzema. That chance come as a warning, a reminder of Madrid’s threat at a time when Barcelona had started to wrest back some control. Another pass from Vinícius set up Toni Kroos, who shot over.At the other end of the same flank, Malcom was becoming a focal point too. He should have put Barcelona level, played through by Luis Suárez on 20 minutes, only to shoot straight at Keylor Navas. You could almost feel his insecurity – but he did not hide. In fact, he was the player Barcelona sought most, finding space in a familiar place: behind Marcelo. The ball went out to him repeatedly, but didn’t always come back in. Willing to run, he was not always able to find the telling pass, and at times was exasperating, but what the Catalans did create largely came from him. On the other side, Coutinho did little, timid again.Piqué headed Malcom’s clipped free-kick just over Navas blocked Semedo after Malcom had slipped him in and then another delivery was headed against the bar by Rakitic. He then wriggled free and found Suárez, whose shot was saved brilliantly by Navas. He remained erratic: when it opened up for him soon after, he gave the ball away to groans from the fans.And yet he would delight them soon enough, when Clément Lenglet’s long pass early in the second half sent Alba sprinting into the area. Navas got out but the ball ran free to Suárez, whose superb shot hit the near post, running across to Malcom. He controlled and, with time to think and to doubt, struck past four men into the net.Barcelona were level, and then Messi was on, entering the fray with Arturo Vidal, Casemiro, and Bale. He was immediately involved, and the ball was Barcelona’s. Messi won a free-kick that he bent into the wall, then almost ran free. But opportunities were few, Malcom and Vinícius having been substituted off. Messi appeared to be choosing his moments, handbrake on, and the best chance fell to Bale when Benzema found him after Marc André ter Stegen failed to clear fully. Inside the area, the goalkeeper gone, Bale was slow to shoot and was closed down. Piqué ed to block another shot, this time from Kroos. At the other end, Sergio Ramos ed too, stopping Messi as the final minute slipped away. There will be at least 90 more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f219ca21cedf38de9426020d5028baad9e8cf2f3/0_143_3175_1905/master/3175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b979817799d7b015b98bb3f340e8203","title":"chelsea women manchester city women continental cup semi final match report","story":"• Chelsea 0-2 Manchester City• Parris scores twice in second halfThe Manchester City manager was full of praise for Nikita Parris after she scored twice against Chelsea to secure a place in the Continental Cup final. “She has a ridiculous intensity to her play and at the minute she’s on form and her mentality is high, it’s a real asset to have someone like that on your team,” said Nick Cushing.Parris’s 18th and 19th goals of the season punished a wasteful Chelsea, who have never reached the final of this competition, and Emma Hayes was left ruing chances missed in the first half. “I‘ve said it all along, you’ve got to take your chances,” the Chelsea manager said, wearily. “We had three glorious chances in the first half and we didn’t take them. We made an error, conceded a penalty and I think it affected us mentally. Goals win football matches. A year ago we were converting those chances.”This was always going to be a close encounter. With the two best defensive records in the league, Chelsea and Manchester City have been tough to break down, conceding 11 and 12 in all competitions respectively but the scoreless first half flattered City. The first real chance fell to Chelsea. Fran Kirby, racing through, tried to chip Karen Bardsley but the keeper saved. Erin Cuthbert was there with the follow-up but could only knock it over from close range under pressure from Jen Beattie.From then on it was the Chelsea show. With City playing 4-4-2, the home team were left with acres of space on the right, Jess Carter punishing Caroline Weir for drifting inside. With five minutes of the half remaining, Chelsea’s best chance fell to Beth England, a free header wide of the far post looking harder to miss than score. With renewed vigour City powered forward after the break and as Parris raced into the box from the right, Deanna Cooper slid in, sending the forward flying.The referee, David Rock, pointed to the spot and Parris, the record WSL goalscorer, stepped up. Hedvig Lindahl went the right way but the shot was too high and powerful for the Swede. With the tables turned, City held their shape much better. “Chelsea caused us a problem tactically, they didn’t do what we expected,” said Cushing. “They went to three at the back and were overloading our full-backs. It was causing us a problem. We had to change things at half-time and the players were incredible at adapting.”It was Chelsea’s turn to try and play on the break but with them pushing for an equaliser, Georgia Stanway and Parris were finding more and more space between the Chelsea lines and it was Parris who doubled the lead, firing past Lindahl to secure their place in the final. “The smile on my face says it all,” said Parris. “I do everything I can to be in the best shape for this team. We’re an offensive team, a pressing team and we didn’t do our jobs in the first half.” City’s opponents in the final could not be more enticing – either Arsenal, who beat them in last season’s final, or Manchester United, with the Gunners hosting the game on Thursday night at Meadow Park."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39803c97afc5db63dc23576ef78c23c07e22d900/82_94_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=308a882d557b7b477a453104801027e4","title":"west bromwich albion brighton fa cup fourth round replay match report","story":"Glenn Murray scored twice in extra time to ensure this tie reached a conclusion and book a fifth-round meeting with Derby but more will surely be heard about uglier events that happened on and off the pitch.The Brighton striker Florin Andone could be called by the Football Association to explain an off-the-ball incident in the first half in which he appeared to drive an elbow into the face of West Brom’s Sam Field. Both managers said they did not see what happened.“What we heard tonight is not nice,” said Hughton. “What we have in Gaëtan is a very upright, respectable inidual. For those who make those chants that’s their inidual choice and it’s down to the authorities and governors of the game to deal with. The game in recent years has acted on such things really well. All Gaëtan wants to do is very much get on with his football. He has conducted himself impeccably.”The chants were all the more audible because the crowd was so sparse, less than 9,000 choosing to turn up to watch a replay between two weakened sides. At least those who concentrated on the game were treated to some entertainment, as it was an open affair with numerous chances. The first two fell to Rodriguez, who forced saves from Jonathan Bond.Leon Balogun then nearly opened the scoring for the visitors, only for his header to come back off the crossbar. Just before half-time Brighton’s bar was left rattling by an exquisite long-range volley by Hal Robson-Kanu.The Championship side took the lead in the 78th minute in farcical fashion. Wes Hoolahan curled a free-kick in from the left and Dan Burn looped a defensive header towards the far post, where Balogun inexplicably stood by as Kyle Bartley hooked it into the net from one yard.The lead did not last long. Four minutes later Andone pounced on a loose pass by Bartley before finishing neatly to send the tie into extra time.West Brom suffered a blow early in the additional period when Robson-Kanu limped off to leave them with 10 men, Darren Moore having made all his substitutions.Hughton introduced Murray from the bench and the 35-year-old scored within two minutes, on hand to nudge the ball over the line from close range after a low cross by Jürgen Locadia.Murray completed the scoring with a crisp finish after being set up by Davy Pröpper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513bb2068483a102387a45465a28272167007ea9/0_99_2991_1794/master/2991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e69d83e9d73cda092f546319b18929a","title":"bbc radio 4 sheds 750000 listeners in year rajar figures commercial rivals","story":"Flagship news and current affairs station’s Rajar figures hit hard by commercial rivalsBBC Radio 4 has lost three-quarters of a million listeners in the last year, according to official figures that show the challenge facing the corporation’s speech radio stations from commercial rivals.At the same time, the commercial talk radio station LBC achieved its highest audience in its 46-year history, reaching 2.2 million listeners a week as they tuned in to more opinionated programming from the likes of Nick Ferrari, James O’Brien and Nigel Farage.The official Rajar figures show the challenges the BBC is up against at a time when commercial rivals are paying big money to lure away its stars. The UK’s three major commercial radio networks are investing heavily in new, digital-only outlets in the belief that the proliferation of digital radios and smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echowill encourage people to try new stations.The BBC’s director of radio, James Purnell, has previously said he was not concerned with such metrics and was instead focusing on developing the audience for the much-criticised BBC Sounds app and ensuring its output was relevant to the next generation through increased investment in podcasting and online audio.The period covered by the Rajar figures was shortly before a substantial changeover in the world of radio that saw several high-profile presenters switch stations including Chris Evans to Virgin Radio, Zoe Ball and Sara Cox starting new shows on BBC Radio 2 and Simon Mayo leaving to start a new classical music station.BBC Radio 1 also lost half a million listeners, though the new Greg James breakfast show added 300,000 people to its audience when listeners aged 10 and over were included.Radio 4’s Today programme is now listened to by 6.8 million listeners a week, only a slight dip on the same period last year. On Wednesday John Humphrys confirmed he would be leaving the station after 32 years with the programme.Elsewhere in the commercial radio sector Bauer Media’s Magic network has hit a record high of 4.2 million listeners, while Global’s Heart network is reaching 9.7 million listeners a week.Rupert Murdoch’s Wireless Group, the third-biggest UK commercial radio group, has made a substantial investment in the likes of Virgin Radio and TalkRadio, but listener figures suggest it is still struggling to build an audience.Despite outbidding the BBC for sports rights and hiring Jeremy Kyle, Matthew Wright and Eamonn Holmes, the audience for its national stations has only edged up slightly from a low base and it remains a comparative minnow in the industry.Virgin Radio only attracted 447,000 listeners a week at the end of 2018, a far cry from the 9 million who tuned in to the final months of Evans’s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show. His bosses will be hoping this figure jumps substantially in the coming months, aided by his high-profile arrival, heavy advertising and cross-promotion from the Sun newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

He added: “Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of no deal, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome.”He concluded: “My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.”May has so far vehemently resisted the prospect of reopening the political declaration, focusing instead on securing changes to the Irish backstop, which has been the flashpoint for Brexiter Conservative MPs.But at the same time, her government has been trying to win over Labour backbenchers with new legally binding promises on workers’ rights.She could propose a new draft bill as early as next week guaranteeing that UK workers’ rights will keep pace with Europe.Backbench Labour sources said the new bill was in the late stages of drafting and would include a “regression lock” that the UK parliament would ensure workers’ rights would never slip below European standards. That approach appears likely to come close to meeting one of Corbyn’s five tests.Multiple Labour MPs who have met May over the past few months have made it clear to her that they needed the guarantees to be made in primary legislation – because they do not trust that May will remain in No 10 for much longer.Those who are in negotiations with the government have insisted that the bill must be tabled and have had at least one day of second reading within the next few months.The Labour MP John Mann, one of the key figures behind the push for legislation, said: “There needs to be a bill produced soon. We aren’t basing anything on a promise, with all due respect to the prime minister. We are doing it based on statute.”The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who has also intimated she could back May’s deal, said the right offer from No 10 could win over up to 60 Labour MPs.But Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield and a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer … In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party – a people’s vote.”Trade unions are understood to have been pushing for the legislation to include an easing of restrictions on union activity. Union leaders had been seeking more concrete proposals for regulation of the labour market after Brexit and the enforcement of existing law.“Their desire to bring in seasonal agricultural workers from around the globe, as well as barista visas, really does ring alarm bells,” one union source said. “Our fear is that when workers depend on their bosses for their visas, exploitation is sure to follow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d1b88e0343f2294bd33ceb76bf2a8df9a5abe8f/0_0_4193_2516/master/4193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=495da21b53b876fbb34a9bc6fb4b79e2","title":"children parents screen time electronic devices bedrooms uk medical officers","story":"Senior medical officers’ screen time recommendations include ban on use during mealtimesParents should not allow children to take phones and other electronic devices into their bedrooms or use them during mealtimes, the UK’s leading doctors have said.The recommendations are two of nine pieces of advice released by the UK’s chief medical officers to guide parents on how to manage their offspring’s use of technology.“Time spent online can be of great benefit to children and young people, providing opportunities for learning and skills development, as well as allowing young people to find support and information,” said Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England.“But we need to take a precautionary approach, and our advice will support children to reap these benefits and protect them from harm.”While the team said there was not enough evidence to issue guidelines on how much time children should spend online or using screens, there was evidence for broader aspects of children’s use of technology, based on how it might upset known beneficial activities, including sleep.Among the pointers, parents and carers are told to tell children not to look at screens when crossing the road, and talk to them about what they are using their devices for.But parents are also rebuked. While being told to discuss the possible misuse of images, words and videos online with their children, the recommendations ask adults to curb their own oversharing.“Parents and carers should never assume that children are happy for their photos to be shared,” the recommendations said. “For everyone – when in doubt, don’t upload!”The guidelines come days after a report by the Commons science and technology select committee flagged a lack of high-quality research into the effects of screen time on young people, including studies that explored the impact of particular uses of screens.A commentary by the chief medical officers that accompanies the guidelines also stressed that more research was needed.However, the officers said immediate action to safeguard young people is necessary by the government, social media platforms and technology companies. Among their suggestions are that the latter sign up to a voluntary code of conduct to protect children online, before the possible introduction of new laws.Further recommendations echo those of the committee, including calls for tech companies to share anonymised data to aid research. The officers also said those who sell technology should make sure consumers are aware of child security features and shown how to use them.Andy Burrows, the associate head of child safety online at the NSPCC, agreed urgent action is necessary.“For over a decade, tech giants have failed to protect their young users, and we can’t waste any more time waiting for them to clean up their act,” he said.“We urge the government to legislate without delay, to make social networks accountable and punish them if they fail to keep children safe.”Dr Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said it is impossible at present to break screen time down into “good” and “bad”, since it is highly dependent on content and context.“Idly flicking through a social media site is not the same as doing research for a project or homework – clearly those are very different activities – but at the moment, they have all got lumped together into a general ‘how much time do you spend on the screen’,” he said.The advice for parents and carers includes:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4853d5e87c6fe742137ee0a503a3498cf1de8e53/0_190_3639_2183/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b0ee1bb32968bb737afafd08adb5c00","title":"england squad six nations france cokanasiga shields cole moon","story":"• Cole and Moon expected to be involved in England’s front row• Joe Cokanasiga and Brad Shields vying for Twickenham actionEngland have kept France guessing by naming Joe Cokanasiga, Brad Shields, Dan Cole and Ben Moon in a 25-man squad for Sunday’s Six Nations game at Twickenham. The quartet replace Mike Brown, Harry Williams, Ellis Genge and the injured Maro Itoje, with the fit-again centre Ben Te’o also surplus to requirements.The recalled Cole and Moon look set to be involved in England’s front-row plans, with Cokanasiga and Shields potentially vying with Chris Ashton and Nathan Hughes for spots in Eddie Jones’s matchday squad. Cokanasiga’s knee was heavily strapped in training at Bagshot, while Shields is only just back from a side strain that ruled him out of contention against Ireland.Te’o, who had been earmarked for a role in Dublin, will have to be patient, with Manu Tuilagi having made an instant impact on his starting return to England’s midfield. With competition for places intensifying, the more experienced Cole and the set-piece specialist Moon have been preferred to Williams and Genge for the encounter with France.England are determined not to be bullied by a huge French pack and believe they can make more of an impact with their set-pieces than they did against Ireland. “We’re not afraid of the confrontation that’s going to come at scrum-time,” said the hooker Jamie George. “We’re relishing that opportunity.”“We were pretty good in Dublin but we know we can take it to a different place in terms of the way we scrum. I’ve played France a few times and they’re always a big, well-drilled pack. Weight is an advantage but there are ways around it. We want to take France to a place where it’s going be tough.”George believes England are responding well to their new defence coach, John Mitchell, for whom this week has already been a memorable one. His son Daryl made his international cricket debut for New Zealand, taking the final wicket in their T20 victory over Indiaon Wednesday.But the former All Blacks coach’s paternal pride – “Just seeing the helmet on his head with the fern on it … it has been seven years of work for the young fella” – will not distract Mitchell from his day job. “France are different opposition with different threats and they may arrive with surprise threats as well,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure we’re ready for that. If we get seduced into their type of game they will thrive. We have to be very disciplined, patient and resilient. We mustn’t get bored.”Mitchell sounds more than open to the idea of remaining beyond the World Cup, describing it as “a nice thing to think about”, and the camp is as upbeat as it has been in a while.Slade also believes England’s display in Dublin owed something to some old-school team bonding during a night out in London. “We had a room, played some darts, enjoyed a couple of drinks and had a real good time,” the centre said.“We do a very similar thing at Exeter at the start of pre-season and it’s a great way to get to know each other. You feel closer to the bloke next to you, because you’ve shared experiences off the field. It’s not purely business and work, you’re playing with your mates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93fc98c87e52e27abd37aa290d650bb4a007a34/0_143_3439_2064/master/3439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f4dbab317c61a9369b490b6fdd5e30","title":"johanna konta katie boulter gb great britain fed cup slovenia","story":"• Boulter beats Slovenia youngster Kaja Juvan 6-4, 6-2 • Konta survives scare to defeat Dalila Jakupovic 7-6 (7), 6-2The path to promotion for Great Britain in the Fed Cup was never likely to be easy, even with a home crowd to call on. Johanna Konta and Katie Boulter got the ball rolling with hard-fought wins on Wednesday night as they beat Slovenia, but with Greece awaiting on Thursday, the hard work is only just beginning.Konta showed encouraging form and timely resilience to get the better of Dalila Jakupovic, the world No 86, 7-6 (7), 6-2, saving three set points in the opening set tie-break before easing away in the second. Boulter, on her Fed Cup singles debut, had already given Britain a 1-0 lead, overcoming a nervy start to beat Kaja Juvan, an 18-year-old ranked No 169, before Konta sealed the win. Britain’s doubles went onto complete a 3-0 win.It will take four wins in four days if Britain are to give themselves a chance to escape Group One, the third tier of the competition. In the past six years, Britain have made it to the World Group II play-off only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. Greece are likely to present a tough challenge, especially for Britain’s No 1 Konta, who will face Maria Sakkari.At No 38, Sakkari is the second-highest ranked player on show here this week, behind Croatia’s Donna Vekic, the world No 25, and Konta knows she will need to be on top form if she is to hold up her end. Although Greece’s 2-1 loss to Hungary on Wednesday may take some of the pressure off.With the 22-year-old Boulter, now ranked 83, looking assured on her debut in the No 2 singles spot, Konta has support in the ranks but with two more group matches to come on Thursday and Friday , and potentially a fourth on Saturday, conserving energy in the early days is crucial.“I didn’t really want to be sitting there in a deciding doubles on day one,” Britain’s captain, Anne Keothavong, said, “but this competition is far from completed and it’s important that they rest, recover and get ready for tomorrow.“Physically it’s tough. Mentally I don’t think you can underestimate all the emotions they go through in the build up to this, playing in front of a home crowd for the first time. It’s completely different to what they experience in the grass court season and the format of this competition is something that shouldn’t be underestimated.”Keothavong was impressed by Boulter, who showed why she is tipped to go much higher in the rankings with a confident showing, dominating with her forehand. At 22, she is in the early stages of her career and it’s rare for her to be the more experienced player on court. But with the 1,800 tickets sold out, the crowd backed her up and helped her get through. “I didn’t know exactly how it would be but being here was quite tremendous,” Boulter said. “Everyone showed so much support and I loved it out there.”Konta, who has dropped down the rankings from inside the top 10 at the start of 2018 to a mark of 39, led 4-2 but was pegged back by Jakupovic, who returned superbly. The 27-year-old continued to take the match to Konta but, having twice given herself the chance to serve out the first set, she could not close it out as Konta held firm.In the tie-break, Jakupovic led 6-3 but in adversity, Konta dug deep, saving all three set points with aggressive play and then, after missing her first set point, she crunched a forehand onto the baseline to take the tie-break 9-7. That eased the nerves and an early break put her in charge in the second. Leading 4-1, she let slip one break but broke again in the next game and served out to wrap up the win.Heather Watson, who missed the Slovenia match because of illness, is unlikely to recover in time to play a part against Greece, placing even more emphasis on the two singles players. Konta beat Sakkari in round two on her way to the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2017 but she knows the Greek is likely to present a bigger challenge this time round.“She has been playing great tennis, especially the last 12 months,” Konta said. “I have a lot of respect for her on and off the court. She is fundamentally a great person and a great player. I am looking forward to playing her.“The last time we played was in Wimbledon in 2017. A lot has happened since then. It is another opportunity for me to play a great player.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88102e90a0cabd772f0a35f770960396ed0522d8/0_276_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08b0297adf6691c1d10e567cda2b3c","title":"team sky doctor richard freeman medical tribunal delayed","story":"Geraint Thomas is confident cycling is now “one of the cleanest sports around” after admitting he would not have won the Tour de France during the sport’s dark ages.“I think what has gone in the past has helped clean up the sport” said Thomas before his first race of the season, the five-stage Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana in Spain. “I am confident it is one of the cleanest sports. That’s great, because there’s no way I would have won the Tour all those years ago. I am fortunate to be at the age I am riding my bike now. I think the sport is in a great period.”The 32-year-old conceded the legacy of cycling’s past meant some people would inevitably question his results. “When it comes to what people think about us and this and that, what can I do?” he said. “What I say, they are going to spin that however they want. I’ll just crack on and go about my business as I always do.“I am not going to stand up and make a song and dance but I do everything the right way. I train hard, work hard and have a lot of support. If people do stuff I can’t do anything about that but I am sure the mindset of the peloton has certainly shifted a lot since the dark ages.”Thomas also confirmed he will miss May’s Giro d’Italia to be in the best possible shape to defend his Tour title, having become the third Briton to win the race after Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome.“The Giro feels like unfinished business and I wanted to think about that,” said Thomas, who crashed while in second place in 2017.“Maybe I’ll race it next year but this year has always been about the Tour.“I did not want to jeopardise the chances of the Tour for anything. As the defending champion I feel as if I have to go back and want to be in the best shape possible.”Meanwhile Dr Richard Freeman’s medical tribunal, which was expected to begin on Wednesday, was adjourned until Friday after his legal team requested a delay. While the application was heard in private, such an adjournment is normally given for health reasons or in exceptional circumstances.Freeman, who faces a series of allegations, including that he ordered banned testosterone for an unnamed rider while working for Team Sky and British Cycling, was not present when his legal representative Mary O’Rourke, who acted for Dr Eva Carneiro in her claim for constructive dismissal against Chelsea, requested an adjournment.After agreeing to hear the request, the tribunal chairman, Stephen Mooney, warned it was likely another adjournment would be sought when the hearing resumed.“The reasons for the adjournment cannot be made public at this time,” he said, “but I can say this, there is likely to be a further application on Friday morning, which will involve legal argument, and it is very likely to be held in private as well.”Freeman faces an allegation he ordered 30 sachets of Testogel, which is on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list, in May 2011 to be sent to the Manchester velodrome to “administer to an athlete to improve their athletic performance”.The 57-year-old, who denies any wrongdoing, is also accused of lying to other members of British Cycling about ordering the drug, saying it was a mistake by the Oldham-based supplier Fit4Sport. He is also alleged to have “made untrue statements” when questioned by UK Anti-Doping in February 2017, saying he had ordered Testogel for a non-athlete member of staff but later returned it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e716abc367f653c36a1afe0528d3dce1420cf188/0_117_2350_1410/master/2350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a86670b2e36f1e16102e411cb9fcf2","title":"disability campaigners give to new emojis for 2019","story":"Guide dogs, prosthetics and accessibility emojis welcomed by rights groupsFrom falafels to mischievous sloths, dozens of new emojis will bring greater ersity to messaging applications this year, as the organisation behind the symbols responds to a number of campaigns.The introduction of image-based characters such as hearing aids, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs and guide dogs will help redress the underrepresentation of disabled people on the emoji keyboard, while there will also be a wider range of mixed-gender and ethnicity couples for users to choose from.Disability rights campaigners welcomed the new accessibility-themed icons. “Love them or hate them – emojis have become part of our everyday digital lives,” said Phil Talbot, the head of communications at disability equality charity Scope. “Social media is hugely influential and it’s great to see these new disability-inclusive emojis. Up to now disability has been greatly underrepresented.”Following a campaign by a girls’ rights charity to introduce a period-themed emoji, a new ‘drop of blood’ icon is also being introduced.“The inclusion of an emoji which can express what 800 million women around the world are experiencing every month is a huge step towards normalising periods and smashing the stigma which surrounds them,” said Lucy Russell, the head of girls’ rights and youth at Plan International UK. “An emoji isn’t going to solve this, but it can help change the conversation. Ending the shame around periods begins with talking about it.”Spanning a number of other items that were previously omitted, the 59 newly approved images are expected to be released in the second half of 2019.The perceived ambiguity of one of the new emojis sparked a debate on social media. It is believed that a pinching hand gesture reported to indicate a person’s penis size could be useful for rebuffing “unsolicited dick pics”.Yawning faces, raccoons, a pot containing the South American drink maté, and waffles were among other new emojis that are potentially less open to interpretation.Last year, the highly anticipated addition of emojis depicting cartoon people with ginger hair dominated the headlines, following the annual series of additions from the Unicode Consortium, the body which maintains and regulates the library of characters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b/0_0_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a7f448a8e7af7ce27175bfcbc4c949b","title":"back up bookmarks google","story":"Jenifer wants a backup while EC wants a replacement for Google+, which is shutting downI have a lot of bookmarked sites for medieval manuscripts on my laptop, which it took a long time to collect.

You should also load the file – drag and drop usually works – into one or more of your free online storage spaces such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox or whatever you prefer. Once the file is online, you can access it from other PCs, smartphones, tablets and other devices.You can even store your bookmarks in a Microsoft Word document, which will preserve any layout and provide Ctrl-clickable links. I do this by loading the HTML file into a browser, saving it as an MHTML or MHT file, loading that into Word and then saving it as Word file (eg as a doc, docx, rtf file, etc). Internet Explorer can save files in the standard MHTML format. Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Opera can also save MHTML files if you edit the settings (chrome:flags or vivaldi:flags or opera:flags etc). Alternatively, add a browser extension such as SingleFile, which works in both Firefox and Chrome. (MHTML usefully encapsulates whole web pages in a single file, without creating a subdirectory to hold loads of separate js, css and other files.)Browsers generally use folders and subfolders to manage bookmarks. Many of them including Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi and Edge also have synchronisation systems built in to sync bookmarks across different devices, which can be used to restore them onto replacement computers should the worst happen. However, folders can become unwieldy when you have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, which is where bookmark managers come in.Bookmark managers generally allow you to add tags, notes and comments. Tags are useful because you can give each link multiple tags, which is like putting them in multiple folders.Bookmark managers should also provide an extension or bookmarklet so that you can bookmark sites from your browser, without going to the bookmark manager’s website.Google has one of the simplest bookmark managers, which is deservedly obscure, but could suit some users. Apple’s iCloud Bookmarks is rather better, and works in several different browsers – Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE but not Edge – on many different devices.I have not used many bookmark managers or checked for online apps, so you’ll have to try a few to find something you like. The options include start.me, Bookmark Ninja, Dropmark, Raindrop.io, Bookmax, Atavi and, for Chrome only, Booky. Sadly, two of the most popular sites in this category – Delicious and Xmarks – have closed down.There’s also the excellent Pinboard, which now costs $11 a year. Pinboard is run by its founder, Maciej Cegłowski, who bought the remains of Delicious.  Technology used Pinboard for a few years for linkbucket blog posts.Pocket – which is incorporated into Firefox but available for Chrome – would work as a bookmark manager, but is generally used for saving pages to read later. Instapaper does much the same thing.Most researchers who need Zotero will already know about it, though it could well suit someone who likes medieval manuscripts.Otherwise, people who habitually use Microsoft OneNote or Evernote will know they can work really well as bookmark managers, as well as storing web clippings, photos, documents and many other things.Bookmarks graduated from being personal directories to shared resources on sites such as Delicious. This gave rise to social bookmarking and, from 2005-07, a boom in folksonomy or collaborative tagging. In other words, lots of different people adding tags to public links. Delicious was the archetypal example of the genre. Lots of us loved it.Folksonomy was replaced by #hashtagging. This is exactly the same thing, except that hashtags can be applied to anything, not just bookmarks. The main hashtagging sites include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But they are social networking sites, not bookmark managers.I would not have suggested Google+ as a bookmarking site, but perhaps its failure as a social network helped make it viable for that purpose. You could replace it with Bookmax (where free accounts are limited to 1,000 links) or Raindrop.io, but Pinterest might be the best alternative.The basic idea of Pinterest is to create public displays, but you can have any number of “secret boards”. These are private by default, though you can share them with selected people. You could create a separate board for each set of bookmarks to cover news, movies, music etc.Either way, you should download your data from Google+ before it closes on 2 April. The download page lets you select posts from your page and Google+ Communities in HTML format, plus contacts from your Circles. These are in vCard format by default, but you can select CSV, HTML or JSON instead. It doesn’t matter because you only get their name, nickname (if any) and their doomed G+ address. You don’t get their email addresses, phone numbers, job titles or anything else that might be useful.You can have your takeout data sent to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or Box, or download it from an emailed link.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Why did the powerhouse that was black TV drama lose its way? We speak to its trailblazers‘We’re guests here, always on our best behaviour, never at ease. No wonder so many of us go round the twist.” So says Don Warrington in Carbon Copy, a television play first broadcast in 1975. Warrington’s character, Albert, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and is reassessing his place in “the mother country” after a recent awakening of his black identity. Had he been able to see four decades into the future, Albert would doubtless feel even less at ease.Last year’s shaming Windrush scandal, in which British nationals of African-Caribbean heritage were targeted for deportation by the Home Office, demonstrates how some in the UK are still determined to treat black people as “guests”. But Albert might also be depressed at the state of British television 40 years on: how little it built on pioneering dramas like Carbon Copy, and how little is even remembered of them.The title of the British Film Institute’s current season, Forgotten Black TV Drama, is no exaggeration. Most of the titles it gathers together have not been seen by the public since they were first broadcast. Between them they tell a story that is in many ways all too familiar, but in others surprising, perceptive and eerily prescient. In another forgotten drama, 1973’s The Museum Attendant, a black character declares “hating immigrants is the only thing that draws English people together”.It is often assumed that US cinema and television blazed the trail when it came to representation of black people on screen, but British television was ahead of both, argues Stephen Bourne, co-curator of the BFI season. The BBC soap Compact, which began in 1962, had a black magazine photographer, played by Horace James, as a recurring character. ITV hospital drama Emergency – Ward 10 regularly featured a black doctor, played by Joan Hooley, who embarked on a relationship with a white man – including a then-controversial interracial kiss. This was in 1964, four years before Lt Uhura and Captain Kirk kissed in Star Trek. And it wasn’t even the first such kiss on British TV (that was in the Armchair Theatre play Hot Summer Night, in 1959).Interracial relationships figure in the forgotten dramas of the BFI season, but they are by no means the sole preoccupation. The works of Jamaican-born writer Barry Reckord, for instance, are about class isions as much as racial ones. In 1962’s You in Your Small Corner, an educated young black man (played by Reckord’s brother, Lloyd) begins a love affair with a working-class white woman. And in Reckord’s Club Havana, from 1975, Warrington comes from Jamaica to his mother’s Birmingham nightclub and begins an affair with the barmaid, played by a young Julie Walters. His mother dismisses Walters as a “cheap white woman” – not good enough for her son.In Carbon Copy, too, Albert mingles with the white middle classes. His mother is a wealthy first-generation immigrant. “In England, people don’t look down on a person for being black,” she tells him. “They look down on him for being uncultured.”After rediscovering his “blackness”, Albert falls for a British-born black woman, played by Cleo Sylvestre, who is not quite as rapturous about their mystical “African” bond as he is. Nor is she into isive race politics, favouring class solidarity. “We’ve got to separate to keep our identity,” Albert tells her. “No,” she replies, “we’ve got to get together with people who’ve been screwed just like we are.”“Why should we assume that all black people that came to Britain after the second world war were working class?” says Bourne, who has researched and written about black British history and culture for 20 years. “There have been middle-class, affluent black people coming to this country since the year dot. It’s just one of those myths that needs to be addressed.”Reckord came from a well-to-do Jamaican family. He earned a scholarship to Cambridge University in 1950 (brother Lloyd joined him in the UK a year later). Between them the Reckord brothers staged and performed some of the first black British works to be performed – several of which were adapted for television.There was also Guyana-born Jan Carew and his Jamaican wife Sylvia Wynter, who spent a few fruitful years in Britain in the 1950s. Their work seems to have found sympathetic ears – on radio, then on the small screen. In 1961, ITV filmed two of Carew’s plays: The Big Pride (co-written with Wynter) and The Day of the Fox. Both are set in the Caribbean but British immigrants would readily identify with their examinations of postcolonial politics and identity. Somewhat incongruously, The Day of the Fox is led by Sammy Davis Jr - who had just made Ocean’s 11 the year before. The fact that he had to come from Hollywood to British TV to make anything vaguely “political” tells its own story.It is difficult to resist the temptation to describe this as a golden age – even if it was only a few enlightened commissioners allowing the occasional black production through the gates. By the 1980s, though, the quality black drama had somehow dried up. Bourne cites Enoch Powell’s infamous Rivers of Blood speech, in 1968, as a turning point. “After that all the good work we’d done before was erased and forgotten.”Sylvestre agrees. Before her part in Carbon Copy, she became one of the first black soap characters: Melanie in Crossroads, who turns up at the motel and announces she is the adopted daughter of the manager, Meg Richardson.According to Sylvestre, the producer Reg Watson cast her in response to Powell’s speech and the rise in racial tensions around Birmingham, where the show was set. “He wanted to show a young, black character who wasn’t defined by her colour,” says Sylvestre. “It was a very bold move at that time. In fact, I used to get people coming up to me in the street who I’m sure would have agreed with Enoch Powell who’d say, ‘Oh, I love your character.’”For the most part, comedy became the preferred medium for broaching British ersity. Warrington went on to star in one of the better offerings: Rising Damp. His character Philip, who claimed to be an African prince but was actually from Croydon, was often the subject of landlord Rigsby’s animosity. Far less sophisticated was Love Thy Neighbour, which wrung crude, cringeworthy racial humour out of a black couple and a white couple living next door to each other. The white husband routinely referred to his black counterpart (Rudolph Walker) as “nig-nog” or “sambo”.That shift from drama to comedy is clearly visible in the work of writer Trix Worrell, best known as the creator of the hit 1990s sitcom Desmond’s. Originally a theatre director, Worrell made his TV debut in 1984, after he won a scriptwriting competition held by the recently launched Channel 4.His play, Just Like Mohicans – also part of the BFI’s season – was adapted into a 40-minute TV drama. It is virtually a two-hander: an encounter between an elderly Jamaican widow and a hip-hop-savvy black teenager (future EastEnders regular Gary Beadle) who breaks into her house to burgle her. The relationship steadily morphs from victim-criminal to mother-son, and the play becomes an angry clash of generational values.It was heavily autobiographical, acknowledges Worrell, who was born in St Lucia and moved to London as a child in the mid-60s. “Our parents bought into that whole empire, British thing and wanted to better us and better themselves. But we were on the street. We had to suffer the slings and arrows. We were the kids that suffered Sus” – “suspected person” laws, a 1980s precursor to stop and search. “We were walking home from school and being spat at and called all sorts of crap – and that’s just by the police. Shit happened all the time. So you start to go, what the hell are we here for?”The only positive representation Worrell remembers growing up was Carmen Munroe as a nurse on ITV soap General Hospital (he later cast her in Desmond’s). But they still watched Love Thy Neighbour, he says. “We watched it because there we were. We could see ourselves on screen, and that was a thrill in and of itself.” There was also the newsreader Trevor McDonald, Worrell adds. “So it went from the sublime to the ridiculous: Trevor reading the News at 10 and Rudy Walker being called a ‘nig-nog’ in the same evening.”Desmond’s was arguably the first mainstream series to simply accept black Britons as characters in their own right, and it was a huge hit. “I’ve always said you can sell more in comedy than you can in drama,” says Worrell. “You can be more hard-hitting. You can bash them over the head and make them laugh at the same time.”Times have moved on and representation has improved immensely on British television but looking back at the passionate, angry, questioning dramas of the 1960s and 70s, something has been lost. Subsequent generations seem to have had less of a platform to engage with these issues seriously – at least on the small screen.New black British talent is more likely to thrive in the US than at home, looking at the experience of actors such as Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Daniel Kaluuya, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and John Boyega. The continuity has been broken. The contributions of these black dramatists and performers is in danger of being erased, from history and from the archives. It is never too late to start remembering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4bd6892d991dd40246f29df5650bad1768f217/0_693_3959_2375/master/3959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12b15373e26f865baa40faeab9530c7e","title":"thursday briefing special place in deal for customs union says corbyn","story":"Labour leader sets out conditions for supporting May … equine flu shuts down British horse racing … and nice work if your parents can get it for youGood morning, Warren Murray here with matters for your attention.As Theresa May heads to Brussels today, Jeremy Corbyn has offered the backing of Labour for her Brexit deal if she supports a permanent customs union with the EU. In a letter to the PM, Corbyn set out legally binding commitments including close alignment with the single market keeping UK rights and protections in line with the EU future UK participation in EU agencies and funding programmes and agreements on future security arrangements, such as the European arrest warrant. “We do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response,” writes Corbyn, arguing that Labour believes its proposals would be acceptable to the EU.May will arrive in Brussels with Donald Tusk’s warning of a “special place in hell” for Brexit’s cheerleaders still echoing off the walls.The European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has stoked the flames by tweeting: “Well, I doubt Lucifer would welcome them, as after what they did to Britain, they would even manage to ide hell.”No screen at bedtime – Children should not be using phones and other devices in their bedrooms or at meals, the UK’s chief medical officers have said, as they launch official guidance for managing screen time. Other pointers are telling children not to look at screens when crossing the road. Parents are also counselled to curb their oversharing. “Parents and carers should never assume that children are happy for their photos to be shared,” the recommendations say. “For everyone – when in doubt, don’t upload!” The doctors added their voice to calls to safeguard young people online, with the government on the verge of imposing a legally binding duty of care on social media companies.All bets are off – The four scheduled horse races in Britain today have been cancelled after three racehorses tested positive for equine influenza, despite having been vaccinated against it. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) made the dramatic move last night. The BHA said the affected stable, in Cheshire, had runners at Ayr and Ludlow on Wednesday, where they were in close proximity to dozens of other horses from many racing stables. “I’ve never known anything like this in all my time in racing,” said champion jockey turned trainer Peter Scudamore. The BHA said shortly after 11pm that it acted with the support of its industry veterinary committee, following confirmation of the positive tests. An outbreak of the highly contagious virus caused turmoil in Australian racing in 2007.E-waste shame – The UK is Europe’s worst country for illegally exporting toxic electronic waste to developing countries, a two-year investigation has suggested. Environmental watchdog the Basel Action Network (Ban) put GPS trackers on computers, LCD monitors and printers sent to recycling facilities in 10 countries, and traced some of them to Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, Thailand and Ukraine. It is illegal under EU law to export to non-OECD countries hazardous electronic waste containing toxic substances such as mercury, lead and flame retardants. Campaigners estimate 352,474 metric tonnes of electronic waste are being illegally shipped from the EU each year, and in some countries it is dumped or burned, potentially contaminating crops and threatening human health.‘They’re super-delicate’ – An airlift for thousands of baby flamingos has taken place in South Africa after drought led to their abandonment by their parents at a disappearing waterhole. The 2,000 chicks were taken from Kamfers Dam in Northern Cape province to several locations including Cape Town where they are being hand-reared.Bird conservationist Nicky Stander said the aim was to raise and eventually release them. “They’re super delicate-feeling. Every time I go to bed I still feel them in my hands,” she said. “I think we all feel very motherly towards them all.”The cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi could extend the lives of thousands of children – but it comes with a price tag of £105,000 per patient per year.The NHS says it cannot afford it.

Plus: Natalie Nougayrède on the conspiracy theories threatening European unityWithin Britain’s elite occupations, the advantages of class are still mistaken for talent – as one of the beneficiaries candidly puts it: “It is mad to pretend there’s not been an incredibly strong following wind throughout my career.” The rocketing incomes enjoyed by top earners since the 1980s, we often hear, are perfectly acceptable, as long as those from all class backgrounds have fair access to the jobs that generate such disproportionate rewards.Pep Guardiola said Manchester City’s return to the top of the Premier League was reward for their refusal to concede the title to Liverpool but warned his team face “a final” against Chelsea on Sunday. In the women’s game, City’s Nikita Parris scored twice against Chelsea to secure a place in the Continental Cup final. A body has been recovered from the wreckage of the plane that crashed in the Channel with footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson on board, three days after the aircraft was found.Johanna Konta and Katie Boulter got the ball rolling on Great Britain’s path to Fed Cup promotion with hard-fought wins as they beat Slovenia, but with Greece awaiting on Thursday, the hard work is only just beginning.

Photograph: PAThe Border town of Newry is being considered as a location to dispose of the United Kingdom’s nuclear waste, with research identifying the area as potentially suitable for an underground disposal facility.It is one of five sites in Northern Ireland under consideration as possible stores for the waste and among 45 being examined across the UK as whole.An area of granite bedrock near Newry may be suitable for a geological disposal facility (GDF), according to a recent preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management (RWM), a UK State-owned company.The area of rock stretches from Slieve Gullion to the Mourne mountains. Geological disposal sites hold radioactive waste hundreds of metres underground, and there are no current facilities in Northern Ireland.Future policy decisions on nuclear disposal in Northern Ireland rest with the Stormont executive, where power-sharing has been collapsed for more than two years. The British government’s current preference is that one facility would service the entire UK, a spokesman for RWM has said. Any future facility would need the support of the local community before it could be approved.Nuclear waste is stored at about 30 sites across Britain, but predominantly at ground level at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.Granite“There are granites and similar strong rocks around Newry, in which we may be able to site a GDF,” the recent RWM report said. “We would need to do more work to find out whether these rocks have suitable properties and thicknesses in the depth range of interest for a GDF.” Preliminary reports into other regions of Northern Ireland found a section of strong rock between Omagh and Cookstown, Co Tyrone, which might support a similar facility.A number of areas in the north of the country could also possibly be suitable, researchers found. These included one location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Derry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.On Monday, an emergency motion was passed at the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, unanimously opposing locating any nuclear waste facility in the local area.Some 45 preliminary regional reports had been completed across the UK, assessing what locations might have suitable rock types to build a facility. The reports began a process that could take 10 to 15 years to identify a suitable area, gain the consent of a local community and build the facility, the RWM spokesman said. There was a “false narrative” that nuclear waste disposal facilities would be forced on communities, he said. The waste facility will contain multiple barriers to secure the radioactive material underground for hundreds of thousands of years. The British government has also promised communities hosting future facilities significant investment.Responding to the Newry report, Sinn Féin MP for South Down Chris Hazzard said Britain could not be allowed to use the North “as a dumping ground” for its hazardous and toxic waste. “Not only would this have dire consequences for our environment but it would also pose a serious health risk to the population,” he said.Fine Gael councillor for Dundalk, Co Louth, John McGahon said the initial report was likely nothing more than a “fishing expedition”.He said the probability of any plan being approved was “extremely remote”. It was important politicians on both sides of the Border were not “asleep on the issue,” but equally that local representatives did not engage in “scaremongering,” he said.

Photograph: Jonathan BradyPA WireGlobal temperatures in 2018 were the fourth warmest on record, US government scientists have confirmed, adding to a stretch of five years that are now collectively the hottest period since modern measurements began.The world in 2018 was 0.83 degrees warmer than the average set between 1951 and 1980, said Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). This means 2018’s average global temperatures were the fourth warmest since 1880, placing it behind 2016, 2017 and 2015.This follows a broader pattern of human-induced climate change, which is boosting increasingly punishing heatwaves, sea level rises and extreme weather. Last year saw a pair of devastating hurricanes hit the eastern US, while record wildfires ravaged California.There was disastrous flooding in India, a huge typhoon in the Philippines and deadly wildfires in Greece and Sweden. The Arctic, which had its second warmest year on record, experienced temperature highs that astonished scientists.“2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.“The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt - in coastal flooding, heatwaves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change.”Nasa and Noaa’s annual climate reports, which were delayed because of the federal government shutdown, echo findings by Berkley Earth and Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which both recently stated 2018 was the fourth warmest on record.Upward trendOn Wednesday, the World Meteorological Organisation announced it, too, measured 2018 as the fourth warmest on record. It said 2016 remains the warmest on record due to a particularly strong El Nino, which is a periodic event that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean and influences weather patterns around the world.“The long-term temperature trend is far more important than the ranking of inidual years, and that trend is an upward one,” said Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the WMO. “The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. The degree of warming during the past four years has been exceptional, both on land and in the ocean.”Mr Taalas said the extreme weather events of the past year have had “devastating repercussions” for people, economies and ecosystems.“Many of the extreme weather events are consistent with what we expect from a changing climate,” he said. “This is a reality we need to face up to. Greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate adaptation measures should be a top global priority.”The relentless warming has highlighted the steep challenges faced by governments if they want to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The world needs to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by the 2030s to avoid breaching limits set out in the Paris climate agreement, the UN warned last year, at a time when global emissions show no sign of decline. -  News and Media"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"About 50,000 people to be affected as most appointments cancelled by stoppageConcerns raised at Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting at overspend on the new hospitalOPW has agreed terms on 16-acre site at port to prepare for no-deal border inspectionsIrish company Realta will supply specialist electronics which will control the temperature of PLATO\u0026rsquos telescopesIndustrial unrest in the health sector escalates as ambulance staff announce actionCouncil chief executive had warned harbour costs could hit Shane Ross\u0026rsquos key projectNew legislation would enable 235-year-old college to secure university statusPublic spending watchdog accused by other Oireachtas groups of waging a \u0026lsquoturf war\u0026rsquoNewry is being considered as a possible location to store the UK\u0026rsquos nuclear refuseDublin docklands development has provided just 26 social homesWorld Meteorological Organisation confirms 2018 was fourth hottest year on recordNo 42 \u0026lsquosurvived war and rebellion\u0026rsquo but delays in redevelopment spark fears for its futureSimon Harris rejects claims review of smear tests will not be finished by year endFormer president says climate justice \u0026lsquoa medical emergency\u0026rsquo at RCSI award ceremonyMinutes of national children\u0026rsquos hospital project steering group show concerns raised about escalating costs from August 2017Michael Shine (86) tells court allegation he masturbated 13-year-old boy \u0026lsquounbelievable\u0026rsquoCourt hears wife of garda attacked twice in the line of duty asked him to leave his jobApplication had been refused on grounds he was not habitually resident in IrelandVictim found dead in underground car park in Dublin\u0026rsquos north inner city in 2017"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3784582.1549487750!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new beginnings secures 50m in funding for social housing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Beginnings is led by barrister and debt advisor Ross Maguire. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw RoundShield Partners, a €1 billion property investment house, has signed a €50 million social housing deal with debt advisory firm New Beginnings.Under the terms of the deal, which are revealed in a letter seen by The , the Irish firm will purchase, refurbish and manage residential properties for RoundShield, which has “agreed to provide up to €50 million in financing for residential acquisition”. The properties purchased by RoundShield will be let to local authorities for use as social housing under leases of 25 years. New Beginnings is led by barrister and debt advisor Ross Maguire. It is understood that the first commitment of funds could be just the beginning for the RoundShield project in Ireland, with one source saying that there were “substantially” more resources potentially available for the project.“The fund has discretionary capital significantly in excess of the requirements related to the possible acquisitions,” according to the letter. Sources with knowledge of the matter said the RoundShield fund had already begun purchasing units and was on the hunt for more deals, including potential off-market transactions. In a statement, RoundShield chief financial officer Herbert Beckman confirmed that the firm, through its Irish social housing fund, was “acquiring residential properties to support Irish local authorities in the provision of social housing”.Substantial renovationHe said the fund was “concentrating on properties that need substantial renovation, or those being sold with social tenants remaining in situ”. The fund is being administered by Davy Stockbrokers, through a Central Bank structure known as an Irish collective asset-management vehicle.New Beginnings was founded in 2010 by Mr Maguire, a senior counsel, and David Hall, the debtors’ rights campaigner. However, the pair had a falling out and have now found themselves on opposite sides of the debate about mortgage debt and the role of private-equity funds in the Irish market. Since then, the firm has expanded to include in its work a range of commercial funding products, including bridging and mezzanine loans for values above €1 million. RoundShield Partners has raised more than €1.4 billion for a variety of investment platforms, but its focus is European asset-backed “special opportunities”. The fund was established in 2013 by three former executives from capital market company ESO Capital.Sources said the deal showed that social housing was becoming an increasingly attractive asset class for overseas investors. While investing in housing for low-income people may not offer the rapid climbs in asset value provided by grade-A offices or high-end residential developments, it allows investors to tap into regular, reliable and government-backed income streams.

About 40,000 nurses will join the picket line in a dispute over staff shortages and pay. About 50,000 people are likely to be affected by the stoppage which will see all outpatient, inpatient and day surgery appointments scheduled for today cancelled. Minor injury units will be closed and routine community nursing services and health centre nurse clinics will also be cancelled. Thursday is the third in a series of eight 24-hour strikes planned by nurses over their pay claim. They are seeking pay parity with other medical professionals which would equate to an approximately € 7,000 pay rise per nurse, or a rise of around 12 per cent. The Government has said it will not offer additional payments to nurses, although it said on Monday it was willing to discuss staffing and other non-pay issues. Nursing unions have rejected the proposal. Separately, an overtime ban by psychiatric nurses has resulted in what the HSE describe as “significant challenges” in ensuring a safe service in mental health facilities Wednesday. This ban will continue throughout Thursday night. The HSE said it was “continuing to engage and negotiate with the PNA”. On Wednesday night, ambulance service staff said they would also go on strike next week. Up to 500 ambulance workers plan to strike for three more days in the weeks ahead as part of a dispute over trade union representation rights and the deduction of union subscriptions at source from their pay.The staff, who are members of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (Nasra), will stage stoppages on Friday, February 15th Thursday, February 28th and Friday, March 1st.The action will run from 7am to 5 pm each day. Members of Nasra already staged a 10-hour work stoppage at the end of January.

Photograph: Francisco SecoAPIt’s been a long time since Ronnie Delany won an Olympic gold in athletics, but that medal famine may soon be over.When it comes to a particular type of running, Ireland is a pedigree performer – consistently unbeatable. The Minister for Sport must move at once to ensure this category gets onto the list of Olympic events.Long distance, middle distance, relay, marathon and so on. It’s a crowded field. But when it comes to the special discipline of overrunning, Ireland has no peer. We are the gold medal, overrunning champions of the globe.How diddo we manage it?That’s the big mystery. But nobody does cost overruns on capital projects like we do. The Best Small Country in the World for Spending Money Like Water.The Government is still baffled about the latest overrun, although this feeling is quite normal. Not for the first time, they’ve brought in an elite invoicing body to find out why it happened. PwC is an international auditing company which provides “professional services” to organisations who want to find out if they have been behaving in an unprofessional manner. The company also specialises in the lucrative niche area of extreme-rapid builds, erecting Chinese walls in the blink of an eye.This is why the Government can award a huge building contract to a company called BAM, then call in PwC to examine how the cost of the original contract ballooned monumentally even when PwC has been supplying professional services to BAM for nearly a decade at a cost to date of €34 million.Wham, BAM and thanks for the contract, Ma’am. And if there is anything untoward in its execution or governance then PwC, behind those separating Chinese walls, will be able to pinpoint it.Government lineEoghan Murphy, who was standing in for the Taoiseach, who was busy standing beside Donald Tusk in Brussels, who was controversially standing up and goading Brexiteers, stuck by the Government line on the overrunning costs.PwC, he said, will be working “in tandem” with the Government in “getting to the root” of the hospital moneypit which nobody saw coming before they fell into it.Although, while he stressed it was a tandem effort, he meant a contraption with many saddles, pointing out that the Minister for Health was busy at Committee answering questions about the overrun that very moment, while the Minister for Finance has also answered questions on the matter, “as has the Taoiseach in the Dáil”.He forgot to mention the Minister for Social Protection, who took a spin earlier in the morning on this unique velocipede. Regina Doherty told RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke that Fine Gael is “painstakingly and excruciatingly prudent and boring when it comes to the economy”, which is why there can be no doubt that the Government’s handling of the cost overruns is beyond reproach, and aren’t they all out there answering questions?Eoghan’s “tandem” was getting very crowded. Furthermore, he told the Opposition, officials were also along for the ride. They went before committees last week where they also took questions.“A process is in place where questions about what happened are being answered but we also have to do a deeper e and PwC will do that.”It doesn’t appeared to have occurred to Eoghan and his colleagues that the controversy is not to do with them answering questions but about why they never thought about asking any when red flags about the costs were being raised as far back as early in 2017.‘Absolute disaster’People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett was concerned with the state of the health service in general, which is in “existential crisis”, but the “absolute disaster” of the children’s hospital is just “the cherry on top”.He pondered over consultants PwC’s auditing BAM’s accounts for nine years and getting paid at least €34 million for their trouble. He said the building contractor has a history of “massive overruns” and “now the people who audited them are the people who apparently are going to get to the bottom of the scandal of the national children’s hospital. It beggars belief.”Mr Murphy was anxious to stress that the Ministers didn’t know about any overruns in 2017. He was also keen to assure everybody that the Government will address these “serious issues” which people are very angry about.Paschal Donohoe repeated later on that the Cabinet is “well aware of the anger and concern” among the public over the children’s hospital, and is also aware of the “great concern” about the cost escalation. However, they have decided to move on with the project and ensure it is completed.But is he really satisfied that PwC will deliver an independent assessment?Fianna Fáil’s Billy Kelleher joined those TDs not too happy about the company’s involvement. Of all the auditing joints in all the world, it was the one the Government chose to walk into BAM.Professional jobPaschal said he is personally confident that PwC will do an independent and professional job “in relation to how this matter developed and in relation to how we can ensure that the remainder of this project is done well”.“It would want to be, for €500,000,” drawled Barry Cowen.Meanwhile, Michael Healy-Rae said what a lot of people are saying in Leinster House about the Government and the hospital overrun and how “every cloud has a silver lining” when it comes to Brexit saving the Government from a worse drubbing.“In case you think that this matter is going to go away,” Healy-Rae declared, “only for Brexit, this would bring ye down, and that’s a fact and each and every one of you know that. This is so serious.”Every TD in the country is now wondering if the knock-on effect of the inflated hospital bill will impact on local HSE budgets, he said. Which is very true – the ranks of the worried include Government backbenchers.But Paschal thinks there is enough money in the kitty to cover the massive shortfall caused by the rising bill for the new hospital. (Money which could have paid for many more much-needed projects.)“You are building it at an enormous overrun, in the wrong place ,and you’re being exposed now for making a mess of it,” was Healy-Rae’s view.This has been a very difficult week for the Taoiseach and his cabinet.On the other hand, we saw a smiling Enda Kenny in the canteen at lunchtime, full of the joys of spring and being assailed by Dáil daytrippers eager for selfies with him.Not missing government at all."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3784736.1549491322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pac denies poaching headline grabbing issues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin TD Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin (L) has alleged PAC had strayed outside its remit in a recent hearing on sick leave and other issues in the prison service. Photograph: Nick BradshawA powerful Dáil committee which acts as a watchdog on public spending has robustly denied it is “poaching” major headline-grabbing issues from other Oireachtas committees. The chair of the Public Accounts Committee (Pac) Seán Fleming has said it does not stray outside its remit, which is to ensure that public money is not being wasted. He rejected the suggestion it was encroaching on the work of other committees. It comes as the chair of the Justice Committee submitted a formal complaint to the Ceann Comhairle about the public spending committee. Sinn Féin TD Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin has alleged Pac had strayed outside its remit in a recent hearing on sick leave and other issues in the prison service. It is understood that Independent TD Clare Daly also made a similar complaint about the Pac hearing into the prison services at the Dáil business committee, where whips decide the business of the Dáil. IncursionsThe Health Committee has also accused the Pac of incursions into its territory, when it held hearings on the cervical check scandal and, more recently, on cost overruns at the national children’s hospital. Separately, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin criticised the all-party committee for inquiring into the finances of Áras an Uachtaráin on the eve of the Presidential election campaign in October. Mr Fleming strongly dismissed any suggestion the Pac was involved in a “turf war”. He told The  the committee has always rigidly adhered to its brief.“We are very clear in the Pac that we have a duty relative to taxpayers’ money. Many departmental activities have financial dimensions and it is our duty to carry out diligence on those.”He gave the CervicalCheck scandal as an example. “We started to a look at it because of the costs of medical negligence. There was a bill of €2 billion facing the State and we needed to interrogate that,” he said.He said the Pac took great care last week to ensure that its work did not duplicate the work of the Health Committee on the hospital project. “As far as our examination of the prison service, there are 1,600 cases being taken against the State on ‘slopping out’. We have rigidly concentrated on finances in our inquiries.”Martin Fraser, the secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach, will appear before the Pac on Thursday to discuss spending in Áras an Uachtaráin. Mr Fleming said it was routine and was born of the aim to include the President’s office in its regular work schedule.

Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAWe are in clutching-at-straws mode here, with barely 50 days to go to a “hard” British departure.And so on Monday, when there was a hint that the European Commission was coming up with a new idea – however thin – to break the backstop deadlock, it was pored over by the British press in forensic detail. In truth a storm in a teacup.Had commission secretary general Martin Selmayr, president Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man, really suggested that it might be willing to add to the withdrawal agreement the assurances given to the UK by Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk, to give them legally binding force?Well, not exactly. In fact, not at all, according to Selmayr, after MPs from the Commons cross-party Brexit select committee suggested as much following a long meeting with him.At issue was whether the idea, which was certainly discussed, emanated from Selmayr or from the MPs. If the former, was he really suggesting that the commission, contrary to its repeated insistence, would be prepared to “reopen” the 585-page withdrawal agreement to include what has been described variously as an additional “codicil” or protocol?‘Unzipping’“I would term it unzipping,” he explained somewhat indelicately.Responding to press reports of the meeting, Selmayr tweeted a non-denial denial saying: “On the EU side, nobody is considering this.”He added: “Asked whether any assurance would help to get the withdrawal agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were ... inconclusive...”What Selmayr did make clear to the group, having emphasised that he, no more than they, was not a negotiator, was that the EU was unlikely to concede anything new without cast-iron guarantees from the UK that would swing the Commons behind them.Any premature offer, Brussels knows, could simply be pocketed by Brexiteers with an endless series of demands for yet more. We are not going there.Kinnock reported that “Selmayr’s question to the Brexiteers was: If we did that, would you vote it through? And they weren’t able to answer that question.”Tory Brexiteer MP Stephen Crabb acknowledged the secretary general was concerned that adding the legally-binding assurance would be worthless if offered to MPs.‘Legal protocol’Crabb told the Express: “We talked around the idea of the Tusk letter being written into some sort of legal protocol but everytime someone asked him if it is something he could do, he said first of all it’s not me negotiating and secondly let me turn around the question – if we were to do that would you be guaranteed to vote for the deal?”A commission spokeswoman on Tuesday described the account as the most accurate report of the meeting – probably the first time the Eurosceptic paper had ever been praised by the commission.In truth few believe that these assurances, even in legally-binding form, could provide Theresa May with anything like the swing votes for her deal that she needs. If this is indeed what she will be seeking in her visit here on Thursday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Juncker and Tusk letter of assurance was sent to the British prime minister last month to help clarify the EU understanding of the backstop, and specifically to respond to demands for a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from it. But it made clear that the EU is not in a position to resile from or in any way undermine the obligations set out in the withdrawal agreement, specifically its Northern Ireland protocol.‘Facilitate the next steps’“As you know,” the letter says, “we are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement, but against this background, and in order to facilitate the next steps of the process, we are happy to confirm, on behalf of the two EU institutions we represent, our understanding . . . ”That understanding involves a joint view of the backstop as a malign necessity which can only be temporary “unless and until” it is replaced by an agreement on a future relationship which provides the sort of guarantees necessary to safeguard a frictionless border.The commission commits to entering negotiations and proceeding with them as expeditiously as possible with a view to ensuring that when the extendable transition period of two years comes to an end it will not be necessary to trigger the backstop.Why anyone should believe that a reiteration of that kind of assurance, whether or not in legally binding form, would help build a May majority is not clear. As Martin Selmayr appears to have pointed out.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

He was speaking after talks with  Leo Varadkar in Brussels. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFigures from the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill said they would definitely speak out fi the Belfast Agreement was threatened.Britain’s hope of striking a trade deal with the United States after Brexit could be in jeopardy if the Belfast Agreement is compromised by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, senior US figures have warned.Speaking at an event in the United States Capitol building to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, Republican congressman Peter King told an audience: “If the British want to consider any type of trade agreement with the United States it is important that the soft border is maintained.”He continued: “What influence we have, we will use it, in the Friends of Ireland” he said, referring to the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill. “We will definitely speak out.”His warning was echoed by Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who was recently appointed chairman of the Ways and Means committee. The committee has sweeping powers over US trade policy, and would have ultimate oversight of any trade agreement signed between the United States and Britain after Brexit.Trade dealSpeaking at the event, which was hosted to honour Tánaiste Simon Coveney who is on a three-day visit to the United States, Mr Neal said that concerns about the Belfast Agreement would “weigh on his mind” as his committee considers a new trade deal between the United States and Britain.He said he has already outlined his concerns to the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, although he ultimately wanted a trade deal between the US and United Kingdom.“I think that America is heavily invested in the success of the Good Friday Agreement and anything that might disturb the success that America offered certainly would not be welcomed, that’s for sure. I think there are few parts of American foreign policy that have worked as well as being an honest broker in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, so we take great satisfaction in what happened and undoing it for a problem that appears as though the British government got themselves into, I think would be a step backwards.”In addition to Mr Neal, two other Irish-Americans – Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania and New York congressman Brian Higgins – are members of the committee.Later, in a speech, Mr Neal commended the Irish Government for the stance it has taken in the Brexit negotiations. “The way that the Irish government has remained so firm on that border is so gratifying to us here,” he said, noting that all parties in Ireland and Northern Ireland except one were unified on the issue.“It is extraordinary that that border has been as successful as it has been and there might even be a debate about going back to checkpoints,” he said.Former congressman Bruce Morrison also warned Britain about the difficulties ahead in negotiating a trade agreement with the United States – a key priority for Brexiteers who have pointed to their ability to negotiate a future trade deal with the United States, and other non-EU countries, as a key economic benefit of leaving the EU customs union. The US is Britain’s main trading partner outside the EU bloc, and exports to the US are worth an estimated 100 billion pounds to the British economy each year.“I think the British have made a lot of assumptions about trade agreements with the US and with other countries and frankly, from a hard-headed economic standpoint, dealing with the EU is a lot more important than dealing with Britain, so I think they have an uphill slog on that,” Mr Morrison said. “They’ve been talking to themselves and not talking to others in thinking how great it’s going to be to be out of the European Union.”Face-to-face meetingThe intervention from Capitol Hill came hours after Mr Coveney held his first face-to-face meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event in the US State Department, at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the need to protect the peace process in the context of Brexit.But Mr Coveney stressed that Ireland was not asking the United States to “take sides” amid increasing concern among the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill about the implications of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement.“I made it very clear to him that we’re not asking the US to take sides – Ireland over the UK or UK over Ireland,” Mr Coveney said. “But we are asking people here to think about a peace process that they have been very much involved in creating and sustaining, and using influence to ensure that decisions that are taken in relation to Brexit don’t undermine that progress.”Nonetheless, he said that Mr Pompeo, as well as representatives of other nations attending the global coalition against Isis on Wednesday, had discussed Brexit. “Obviously there have been a lot of questions today from US voices, but also many of the other ministers who were here today for the conference, all asking the same questions – where is this going, how can we avoid a no deal Brexit.”Mr Coveney’s visit continues on Thursday with bilateral meetings with member of Congress about Brexit and its implications for the border with Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Yellow weather warnings for wind have been issued to the entire south of England and Wales from Wednesday afternoon through to Saturday evening. Overnight winds reached 79mph on the Isle of Wight, and 67mph on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall.The Met Office has warned residents to prepare for power cuts, travel disruption and an impact to services as two separate weather fronts cross Britain.The first, on Thursday, means that everywhere south of Manchester will be subject to the yellow warning. A second warning comes into place at midday on Friday and lasts until Saturday at 6pm and covers all of Britain south of Dundee. Northern Scotland has been issued its own yellow warning for rain. Meteorologist Mark Wilson advised motorists to take care.He said: Be mindful that there could be some tricky conditions on the roads, for example there will be strong winds that could affect transport, like high-sided vehicles crossing bridges, so there could be delays.While winds will ease off into breezy weather mid-morning, leaving sunshine and showers, gusts are due to pick up again by midday on Friday, with a warning from then covering most of the UK and remaining in place until Saturday evening.This will be accompanied by a warning for persistent heavy rain in Scotland, where as much as 60mm is forecast to fall over high ground.Temperatures will stay mild on Thursday, with highs of 7C (45F) in Scotland and 10C (50F) in the south of England, Mr Wilson added.The yellow warning for wind says: Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likelyDelays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likelySome short term loss of power and other services is possibleIt’s possible that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities could be affected by spray andor large wavesThe latest bad weather has not yet been upgraded to a storm, which requires the weather warnings to be at least amber or red.Although cold, January 2019 was a very dry month for much of the UK with many places seeing less than half the expected rainfall.The end of the month saw a cold spell that brought widespread ice and snow.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May set for crunch talks with EU leaders in Brussels after Donald Tusk\u0026#39s \u0026#39place in hell\u0026#39 jibeLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested in connection with missing Hull studentBody recovered from wreckage of Emiliano Sala\u0026#39s planeThe World Exists to \u2028Be Put on a Postcard, British Museum review: these mini-artworks are witty, fun razor-sharpLabour anti-semitic rows help push hate incidents against Jewish community to highComment: Let’s celebrate the wonderful ordinariness of small-town lifeThink no evil: kind thoughts can boost immune system, study findsMiddle class parents should lose their free nursery hours because childcare policy \u0026#39entrenches inequality\u0026#39, MPs sayComment: In order to survive after Brexit, the Tories need to be more than the party of freedomOcado Andover warehouse fire prompts evacuation of nearby homesUniversity applications up for first time in three years, fuelled by rise in international studentsBan children\u0026#39s smartphones from mealtimes and before bed, parents toldFive-yearly cervical cancer screening will save lives, NHS trial suggestsBehind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of a Child, review: a sobering film about children living with domestic violence Comment: The Government will move against social media firms if they continue to fail our childrenComment: Life as a royal wife is a marathon, not a sprint.

But Mr Maduro, who has the support of the army, will not allow it to cross the border.On Wednesday, Venezuelan soldiers were using a fuel tanker and cargo containers to cut off access to the Tienditas bridge, which links the Colombian border town of Cucuta to Ureña in Venezuela.Members of Venezuela\u0027s Bolivarian national guard could also been seen at the border crossing.The Colombian Foreign Ministry says a second crossing in the northern department of La Guajira has also been blocked.A blockade at the Tienditas bridge, on the Colombian-Venezuelan borderMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, reacted angrily to the blockade, tweeting: “The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The US \u0026amp other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela’s military under Maduro\u0027s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE. #EstamosUnidosVE”John Bolton, the US national security advisor, echoed his comments, and lashed out at Mr Maduro for seeking only to look after himself.“Maduro and his cronies live lavishly in Europe and enrich their Cuban patrons while plundering Venezuela’s wealth,” he said. “Meanwhile, they are physically blocking the Venezuelan people, including the military rank and file, from receiving humanitarian assistance.”He said the US would protect any senior military official who accepts Mr Guaido’s legitimacy.“The US will consider sanctions off-ramps for any Venezuelan senior military officer that stands for democracy and recognizes the constitutional government of President Juan Guaido,” he said. “If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely. Make the right choice!”Mr Maduro, increasingly isolated, has sought to sell off the country’s gold reserves to keep his regime afloat. The Bank of England, which holds $1.2 billion in Venezuelan gold, has blocked him from doing so, but Mr Maduro\u0027s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led national assembly, an opposition politician said Wednesday.Nicolas Maduro, pictured inspecting troops on MondayCarlos Paparoni also said that Mr Maduro\u0027s administration had transferred 127 million euros to bank accounts in Russia, without specifying when. Since Monday, the Venezuelan government has not been able to move money between its accounts in banks in the European Union, he added.We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold, Mr Paparoni said.The FBI raided a bank in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, on suspicion of the bank breaking sanctions placed on senior members of Mr Maduro’s government.And the aid delivery represents the latest attempt by Mr Maduro\u0027s political rival, 35-year-old national assembly president Mr Guaido, to weaken the Venezuelan regime by forcing members of the military to disobey Mr Maduro\u0027s orders.Mr Guaido on Tuesday met with former cabinet members of the late Hugo Chavez to discuss the way out of the impasse. He also met with mayors of Venezuelan cities to discuss distributing the aid.Venezuelan opposition leaders, who have gathered in Cucuta, appealed to the Venezuelan military to allow safe passage for the aid trucks.You know there\u0027s a red line, you know well there\u0027s a limit, you know that medicines, food and medical supplies are that limit, said Miguel Pizarro, a pro-Guaido politician.Tents and other logistical supplies have begun to arrive in Cucuta, but the bulk of the 60 tons of aid remains in the Colombian capital, Bogota. Local officials suggested the arrival may be delayed until the border crossing is cleared, or until both sides have negotiated an agreement to let the aid pass.The United Nations and the Red Cross expressed alarm on Wednesday about the politicisation of aid.Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives, said Stephane Dujarric, UN spokesman, speaking in New York.When we see the present stand-off it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary to find a solution leading to lasting peace for the people of Venezuela.Mr Guaido wrote to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month asking for help in tackling the country\u0027s crisis. But Venezuela\u0027s seat at the 193-member world body is held by Mr Maduro\u0027s government and Mr Guterres is unable to ramp up a humanitarian response in Venezuela without Maduro\u0027s approval or UN Security Council authorisation – something which would be blocked by Russia and China.In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was doubling its resources to cope with the crisis, where food and medicine shortages have pushed 2.3 million people to flee since 2015.Our focus is really to, on the one side increase our response to Venezuelans, and on the other hand to keep away from the political controversy and political isions which are characteristic to the crisis in Venezuela, said Peter Maurer, ICRC chief.Juan Guaido, the man recognised by Britain, the US and dozens of other nations as the rightful interim president of VenezuelaWalter Marquez, a former member of Venezuela´s national assembly, told The  that the refusal to allow the entry of food and medicines contravenes international law.“The UN must assume its responsibility to protect the people of Venezuela,” he said. “The International Criminal Court has the power to take preventative measures and that´s what we´d like to see.”Mr Maduro has said repeatedly that the arrival of humanitarian aid would be the start of a US-led invasion, insisting that no one will enter, not one invading soldier.”Mr Marquez denied that the Venezuelan opposition hoped to provoke military intervention, but he said he was pessimistic about the chances of a peaceful solution.“I don\u0027t see how negotiations will work,” he said. “They will have to use force to get the aid in.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May set for crunch talks with EU leaders in Brussels after Donald Tusk\u0026#39s \u0026#39place in hell\u0026#39 jibeLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested in connection with missing Hull studentBody recovered from wreckage of Emiliano Sala\u0026#39s planeThe World Exists to \u2028Be Put on a Postcard, British Museum review: these mini-artworks are witty, fun razor-sharpLabour anti-semitic rows help push hate incidents against Jewish community to highUK weather: Winds up to 70mph to batter Britain for four daysComment: Let’s celebrate the wonderful ordinariness of small-town lifeThink no evil: kind thoughts can boost immune system, study findsMiddle class parents should lose their free nursery hours because childcare policy \u0026#39entrenches inequality\u0026#39, MPs sayComment: In order to survive after Brexit, the Tories need to be more than the party of freedomOcado Andover warehouse fire prompts evacuation of nearby homesBan children\u0026#39s smartphones from mealtimes and before bed, parents toldUniversity applications up for first time in three years, fuelled by rise in international studentsFive-yearly cervical cancer screening will save lives, NHS trial suggestsBehind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of a Child, review: a sobering film about children living with domestic violence Comment: The Government will move against social media firms if they continue to fail our childrenComment: Life as a royal wife is a marathon, not a sprint.

He was boosted on Saturday by the defection of a top air force general.His fledgling alternative administration will hold talks in Washington February 14 on responding to the largest hemispheric humanitarian crisis in modern history.Maduro disclosed on Monday that he sent Pope Francis a letter seeking help in mediating the country\u0027s crisis. The pope told journalists Tuesday that this would require agreement from both the government and the opposition.The United Nations said 40 people were killed in clashes with security forces in a week of protests last month, coinciding with Guaido\u0027s self-proclamation as acting leader. Local NGO Foro Penal said almost 1,000 people were detained between January 21 and 31.Please review our commenting policyValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and the heart are associated with loveBrexit latest news: Theresa May set for crunch talks with EU leaders in Brussels after Donald Tusk\u0026#39s \u0026#39place in hell\u0026#39 jibeLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested in connection with missing Hull studentBody recovered from wreckage of Emiliano Sala\u0026#39s planeThe World Exists to \u2028Be Put on a Postcard, British Museum review: these mini-artworks are witty, fun razor-sharpLabour anti-semitic rows help push hate incidents against Jewish community to highUK weather: Winds up to 70mph to batter Britain for four daysComment: Let’s celebrate the wonderful ordinariness of small-town lifeThink no evil: kind thoughts can boost immune system, study findsMiddle class parents should lose their free nursery hours because childcare policy \u0026#39entrenches inequality\u0026#39, MPs sayComment: In order to survive after Brexit, the Tories need to be more than the party of freedomOcado Andover warehouse fire prompts evacuation of nearby homesUniversity applications up for first time in three years, fuelled by rise in international studentsBan children\u0026#39s smartphones from mealtimes and before bed, parents toldFive-yearly cervical cancer screening will save lives, NHS trial suggestsBehind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of a Child, review: a sobering film about children living with domestic violence Comment: The Government will move against social media firms if they continue to fail our childrenComment: Life as a royal wife is a marathon, not a sprint.

To lure her away, Apple gave Ahrendts company stock valued at $70 million in 2014. In her last full year at Apple, she received a compensation package valued at $26.5 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u0026nbspAhrendts’ arrival at the Cupertino, California, company coincided with the rollout of the Apple Watch, which the company designed to be a fashion statement in addition to a wearable piece of technology.\u0026nbspWhile at Apple, Ahrendts engineered renovations of high-profiles stores in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and other cities in an attempt to transform them into hip places to hang out while shoppers checked out the company’s latest innovations. Her lofty description of the stores as the equivalent of “town squares” became the subject of derision among some analysts and media commentators.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The difficulty ranges from simple phrases like woman kicking the football, to more complex concepts like celebrating a festival.Crucially, the AI has never seen these phrases before and must either guess them from images drawn by the human player, or convey them to the human through its own series of images.The difficulty in teaching artificial intelligence common sense has proved to be one of the key stumbling blocks in developing chatbots and voice assistants that are genuinely multi-purpose.This is a first step toward exploiting common sense, said Aniruddha Kembhavi, a computer scientist who worked on the project.Fellow computer scientist Ali Farhadi added: We wanted to build an AI system that can collaborate with human beings, and at the same time is learning about how humans think, how they act...

This was a 1.4 percentage point increase on the application rate in 2018.It comes despite a 1.8 per cent fall in the overall number of 18-year-olds in England.Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said: “I expect the confirmation of home fee status next year could have helped the numbers, although so could the weak pound as it makes life in the UK cheaper for both EU and non-EU students.”The number of applicants from China increased by a third this year - rising to 15,880, which brings Chinese applicant numbers to almost the same level as those from Wales and Northern Ireland.On the rise of applications from 18-year-olds, Ms Stevens added: “These figures show there remains a strong appetite for university study. Time spent at university opens-up lifelong opportunities for students and prepares them for an uncertain and competitive job market.”Universities accept fewer students as overall A-level pass rate dropsUniversities \u0027should do more to tackle student mental health crisis\u0027Unconditional offers may mean A-level students take \u0027foot off the gas\u0027Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) think tank, told The Independent: “There is so much uncertainty at the moment with Brexit but getting a degree is almost an insurance policy against future problems.”He added: “We know that the people that are most worried about Brexit are young people. They are the ones who think, rightly or wrongly, that the future has been made more difficult for them.“The more highly skilled you are, the better your life chances. It is a very rational thing that young people are doing.”James Seymour, director of admissions at the University of Buckingham, said: “Although there’s lots of uncertainty around Brexit there’s a feeling of certainty when it comes to doing a degree in the UK.“There’s a feeling of ‘it’s my choice’ regardless of what is going on with Brexit. There have been some question marks over apprenticeships but people feel they can trust a degree.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: In this time of uncertainty, it\u0027s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.Alongside this, demand from UK 18-year-old students remains strong, despite the falling numbers of this age group in the population.The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: It\u0027s excellent to see that 18-year-olds in England increasingly value a university education, with a record rate of applications.We are also pleased to see a record high in the percentage of young people from disadvantaged areas applying to university.However, we need to be more ambitious. To retain a competitive advantage on the global stage post-Brexit we must encourage and support more of the population through higher level study.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Cook travels to Brussels to meet the famous duo, who have\u0026nbspturned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artworkClick to followThe IndependentGilbert and George outside their house in Spitalfields: ‘We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us’In a dilapidated old arsenal on the industrial edge of Brussels, Gilbert and George are singing the music hall song that made them famous. Their audience seem a bit bemused, and who on earth can blame them? “Underneath the Arches” is as British as warm\u0026nbspbeer or test match cricket, and equally incomprehensible to European punters. First performed by a very different duo, Flanagan and Allen, way back in the 1930s, it was already a golden oldie when Gilbert and George started singing it in art galleries 50 years ago.Half a century later, it’s become the theme tune for their lifelong career as Living Sculptures. No wonder these continental liggers are nonplussed. To anyone who isn’t steeped in British culture, with its weird passion for nostalgia, Gilbert and George must seem very odd indeed. “We never wanted to be weird because all artists like the idea of being weird, and we never wanted to be normal because everybody’s normal,” says George, by way of explanation. “We like to be weird and normal at the same time.”Gilbert and George are here in Brussels to open Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs. Each year, a famous artist is invited to be Brafa’s guest of honour. Last year, it was Christo. This year, it’s Gilbert and George. Their big bold artworks are scattered around this huge hall, an incongruous contrast to the antique paintings that surround them.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis juxtaposition is surreal – and here in the Belgian capital, the city of Magritte, that’s really rather fitting. For Brexit-obsessed Britons, Brussels may be synonymous with the European Union, but for Europeans it’s always been synonymous with surrealism – and what could possibly be more surreal than Gilbert and George?Despite their matching suits, and shirts and ties, they’re easy to tell apart. George looks like Eric Morecambe. Gilbert looks like Ernie Wise. However, unlike Eric and Ernie, they’re more than just a double act. They live together, they work together, they always appear in public together. This has been their way of life since they met, in London, in 1967, at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins). Their artworks are striking, and often bizarrely beautiful, but they’re a sideshow compared to their greatest work of art: themselves.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George: portraits and works Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George in their local cafe in Spitalfields, 2017Gilbert and George outside of their favourite restaurant, Mangal II, a Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington 2017 Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Gilbert and George, 2015Gilbert and George in their younger yearsGilbert and George - SFG (2013)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - HANDBALL (2008)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - TEACHER STRAIGHT (2011)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD RAIDS (2016) Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD MAD (2016)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George, 2017Early morning.

Everyone assumes so, but no one seems to know for sure, and their public life is far more intriguing than whatever they might get up to in private. Young men feature prominently in their work, women are conspicuous by their absence, but you wouldn’t call these pictures homoerotic. Indeed, there’s something strangely sexless about them, like artworks from another planet.Their\u0026nbspDirty Words\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspNaked Shit\u0026nbsppictures caused a predictable furore (the titles are self-explanatory) but most of their work isn’t overtly controversial. The most radical thing about them isn’t their art, but the way they’ve merged their inidual identities into one.‘Fake’ Hitler paintings seized by German police in BerlinThey’re reluctant to discuss the details of their lives before they met, but their backgrounds are fascinating. When pressed, they stress the similarities – they were both war babies from provincial, lower-class, unartistic families – but the differences are far more notable, and the most notable difference is that one half of this very British duo wasn’t originally British at all.Gilbert Prousch was born in a small village in the Italian Dolomites in 1943. His father was a shoemaker, like his grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather before him, but after the war mass-produced shoes became much cheaper and so Gilbert’s father struggled to make a living. Inspired by Michaelangelo, Gilbert studied art in Salzburg and then in Munich, where he heard about St Martin’s. He travelled to London and wangled a place on its internationally renowned advanced sculpture course. He didn’t speak a word of English. He still speaks with a strong Italian accent today.George Passmore, conversely, speaks like a BBC newsreader from the 1950s. He was born in Devon in 1942. His father left home soon after George was born, possibly before. His mother was uninhibited, and George had a succession of “uncles”, which must have exposed him to gossip in postwar Totnes. At state school he showed a talent for art, which eventually won him a place at Dartington Hall, a private school renowned for its progressive attitudes. Inspired by Van Gogh’s letters, he went on to art school, and ended up at St Martin’s, on the advanced sculpture course, with Gilbert Prousch.“George took an interest in me,” says Gilbert. They became friends – and then lovers? Last time I met them, in their home in London, I asked them if it was love at first sight. “No,” said George. He described their relationship as something that happened gradually, “like an atmosphere or a cloud”. Do they ever wonder what might have happened if they’d never met? The idea clearly seems inconceivable to them. They believe they were destined to be together. “It was fate,” says Gilbert.The sculpture course at St Martin’s was (in)famously laissez-faire. Students could do whatever they wanted, which suited Gilbert and George just fine. “St Martin’s was the best art school in the world,” says Gilbert. “This was a school that said to an artist, ‘Anything goes. You are free to think in different ways.’ No other art school did that.” His art training in Munich had been traditional and academic. “St Martin’s was different – anything could be art.”Their fellow students included Barry Flanagan, Bruce McLean and, most notably, Richard Long, who turned walking into an artform. Gilbert and George went even further. They turned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artwork. As Gilbert says, “We were the centre of our art.”While Long set off into the wilderness, Gilbert and George wandered around London’s East End. It was here, in a Dickensian junk shop, that they found an old record of “Underneath the Arches”, and came up with the idea of singing along to it, for hours and hours on end. They called this artwork The Singing Sculpture. “We felt we were doing something different,” says Gilbert. Like all the best ideas, it was both in keeping with, yet contrary to, the spirit of the times. Conceptual art was all the rage, but most of it was terribly earnest. Their Singing Sculpture was full of fun.Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs\u0026nbsp(Fabrice Debatty)“For the artists who were showing in those galleries, colour was taboo, figuration was taboo, sex was taboo, feeling was taboo – and these were all of the things we were interested in,” says George. Other artists got drunk in the evening, then went back into the studio in the morning to make sombre, sober art. Gilbert and George turned their drunken revels into art.They couldn’t get any public subsidy, and they had no family money to support them. Looking back, they now believe this gave them an advantage. “We could feel more free – we didn’t have to fit in in any way,” says George. “Middle-class people are more constrained.”They got their big break at a group show in London called When Attitudes Become Form. When the curator declined to include their work they gatecrashed the private view, and stole the show with their Living Sculptures, standing in the middle of the gallery like showroom dummies. Konrad Fischer saw them at this show, and asked them to perform in Düsseldorf. In Düsseldorf they were seen by Illeana Sonnabend, who invited them to New York. Fischer and Sonnabend were two of the world’s most influential art dealers. Gilbert and George had arrived.Around the same time they moved into a Georgian townhouse in Fournier Street, in London’s Spitalfields. They’ve lived there ever since. It was a poor area when they moved in. It’s got a lot smarter since, but it’s still a tough old place. The tramps that used to live there have been replaced by drug addicts, but they don’t mind this shifting cityscape – they embrace it. “We are very optimistic people,” says George. “We are never against anything.”Like a lot of their boldest statements, this is only partly true. They were certainly against the artistic orthodoxy of the 1960s and 1970s. In their suits and ties and starched white shirts they stood out a mile. “To be an artist you had to be critical. You had to be against the bomb, or against America, or against the Conservatives or against Labour,” says George. “We thought, ‘How marvellous it would be if we didn’t have to be Anti!’” It’s a philosophy they maintain when people bring petitions to their front door. “If it’s for something, we sign it. If it’s against something, we don’t sign it. We must have signed for some horrible things, but at least we were for.”Living in Spitalfields has been absolutely central to their art. “We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us,” Gilbert tells me. “It’s an amazing mixture of different kinds of people.” Spitalfields has long been a refuge for arriving immigrants: Huguenots, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims… “The East End of London is a mixture of so many countries, a mixture of so many different people.” This is just the way they like it. “You face the modern world whenever you step out of the front door,” says George.They’ve exhibited all around the world, but though their pictures attract a lot of interest, wherever they go the main attraction is always Gilbert and George. It’s the same story here in Brussels. It’s like attending a press conference with Quentin Crisp and Oscar Wilde. Sure, it’s the same show every time, more or less, endless variations on a single theme, but it’s still more entertaining and enlightening than talking to any other artists I can think of.They set off for a walk around Brafa, followed by a swarm of hacks. “Our motto is ban religion,” says Gilbert, as they pause for photos in front of one of their monumental pictures. Religion loomed large in both their childhoods: Gilbert was raised a Catholic George’s brother became a vicar. Their artworks are oddly reminiscent of stained glass windows, but they’re both devout atheists. “We don’t believe in God,” says Gilbert. “All the gods are manmade. We are in charge of what we are doing in this world.”“We’ve always firmly believed that the national galleries of the world should remove all of the Christian art and hand it back to the Church,” says George. “They can look after the insurance and maintenance and conservation, and give over the national museums to humanist art, not Judeo-Christian voodoo.” George tells a story about an elderly vicar who knocked on their front door. “I thought it was marvellous that you said Ban Religion,” he told them. “My congregation come to church every week, and they’re all very religious. But I don’t want them to be religious. I want them to be good.”“We believe in the enlightenment, when people became human for their own sake,” adds Gilbert. “They didn’t need God anymore to make themselves human.” Their heroes are Charles Darwin and Alan Turing.We stop in front of a montage they made from tabloid posters, which they stole from outside newsagents. “It’s not a very easy thing to do because the shopkeepers don’t like you to do that, so one of us would go into the shop to distract the shopkeeper while the other stole the poster,” confesses George. “After three and a half years we ended up with more than 3,700 posters, and then we ided them into subjects – the ones which said Rape, the ones that said Murder, the ones that said Mugged, and ended up with a very big group of pictures.” They only got caught once. “We were very polite and gave it back to the shop, but we went the next night and stole it again.”‘Honest posters’ take down this year’s Oscar nomineesMan mistaken for employee strolls out of art gallery with $1m paintingThe rise of graphic novels, from To Kill a Mockingbird to SabrinaDespite these rebellious attitudes, they’re reassuringly old-fashioned. They don’t use the internet, or mobile phones. The only time they use the telephone is to book a table at the local restaurant where they’ve eaten for the past 20 years. After 50 years in the spotlight, they still maintain they’re outside the art establishment.Maybe they were, once upon a time (when they met, in 1967, homosexuality had only just been decriminalised) but that time has long since passed. Today they’re Royal Academicians who’ve exhibited in virtually every major gallery across the globe. If they were ever anti-establishment, the establishment has long since absorbed them. Yet for all their success there’s still something discreetly anarchic about them, a hint of danger behind their impeccable manners and immaculately tailored suits.They’re now lionised by the art world, but they don’t like hobnobbing with other artists. “We had friends in London, Paris, Germany, New York, a huge group of friends – drinking, celebrating, parties – and then one day we cut it off, we stopped,” says George. “We realised it was all to do with gossip and business – the nightmare of a world that has nothing to do with being an artist.” “We wanted to be free of gossiping,” says Gilbert. “We have friends, but we don’t want artist friends.” Though the art world has appropriated them, and sanctified them, they’re still outsiders at heart.So what advice would they give to an aspiring young artist starting out today? “Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, sit on the edge of your bed, keep your eyes closed, and don’t open them and stand up until you have decided, ‘What do I want to say to the world today?’” says George. Gilbert’s advice is a lot more succinct: “Fuck the teachers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is unlikely the pair will ever be heard from again.It has been more than a month since the robots were last heard from and they are now millions of miles beyond the red planet.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut Nasa considers the very fact it could talk to them at all a major success. The two craft pushed up against the limits of experimental technology, they say, and helped prove concepts that could allow such tiny robots to venture even more deep into space.MarCO was th first interplanetary mission to use a class of small spacecraft known as\u0026nbspCubeSats. Together, the pair worked as communications relays during the landing of InSight, a Nasa rover that dropped down around New Year and will be delving deep into Mars\u0027s surface.The two spacecraft were able to beam back data during the descent of the lander in near real-time, and sent back the stunning first images that were taken by InSight. The craft even did some science of their own: WALL-E took its own photos, and EVE did some simple radio science.Because the technology was experimental, Nasa weren\u0027t relying on either of the CubeSats working at all. If they had broken on their way – as engineers suspected they might – the data would still have been sent back but it would have taken much longer to receive it.After their work was done at Mars, they carried on off into space. WALL-E hasn\u0027t sent a message since 29 December, and is thought to be more than a million miles past Mars EVE is even further away, at about two million miles, and hasn\u0027t spoken to Nasa since 4 January.Nasa\u0027s Mars InSight lander sends back stunning first selfieResearchers don\u0027t know exactly why the pair have lost touch. WALL-E has a leaky thruster and might be wobbling so that it can\u0027t send commands. The sensors that allow them to charge their batteries from the sun might also have broken.They will continue flying away from Earth as February goes on, making sending any data\u0026nbspever more difficult and so meaning that Nasa don\u0027t expect to ever hear back.This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us, said Andy Klesh, the mission\u0027s chief engineer at JPL. We\u0027ve put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But what about the impact on firms that only sell in the UK? Ben Chu looks at the possible consequencesClick to followThe IndependentSupermarkets may sell only to British-based customers but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the EUThe Brexit media spotlight has, for understandable reasons, tended to shine on exporting firms and major manufacturers with just-in-time supply chains, such as Nissan.These businesses are clearly at severe risk from the impact of a no-deal Brexit because they would suddenly face EU tariffs or import delivery problems that could shatter their ability to function.But what about UK firms that don’t export or manufacture? What about those companies that simply serve the domestic\u0026nbspmarket? What about smaller companies? What might the impact on them be?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe answer is (as so often): it depends. If these firms rely on imports for their stock they too are severely exposed to any problems at the border. Think of supermarkets and grocers. They may sell only to British-based customers, but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the European Union.Retailers that source “fast-fashion” clothing items from developing countries\u0026nbspcould also be adversely affected. That applies as much to small independent shops as it does to department stores.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply. If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.The impact on domestic manufacturers that mainly sell in the UK will depend on the share of the raw materials they import.Another likely problem for these domestic-focused importers is the pound. Most analysts expect a no-deal Brexit to result in another major fall in the value of sterling versus other currencies.How UK businesses are preparing for BrexitThis would push up their import costs. Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

The bearer of the sign completed a 32-minute silence to show her support for the 32 people who, on average, take their own lives in Britain every day.A counter-attack on the dominant Armistice Day narrative of peace. It’s a risky and rare question to ask the high street in a city so adherent to the story of sacrifice. The heresy blends – or disappears – within a blur of urban reflections and the giddy faces of Christmas capitalism. Not quite the changing of colour that the charity sign has in mind, but I am thankful for this fleeting glimpse of a “green” landscape, bringing colour – momentarily – to an otherwise grey concrete and overcast city. Fairground rides are assembled at the end of the high street in preparation for the turning-on of the Christmas lights. In the process of construction, when all the parts aren’t put together and fully formed, the ride and the flag and the worker look pathetic and comical.

But it is still beautiful, not only geometrically with its lines and curves against the fluidity of the ocean, but also as an emblem of a British seaside culture slowly fading.On the euro, the UK would have lost the opt-out, and be required to fix the pound’s exchange rate irrevocably to the euro, and to transfer the running of UK monetary policy – interest rates – from the Bank of England to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayOn a two-day visit to Belfast, Ms May set herself at odds with Brexit hardliners by saying she was seeking “changes” to the controversial backstop, rather than its total removal from the withdrawal agreement.The backstop\u0026nbspwould see the UK tied to a customs union – and Northern Ireland\u0026nbspbound to some single market\u0026nbsprules – if a trade deal cannot be agreed.The DUP and Ulster Unionists are vociferously opposed to the mechanism but Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party argue it\u0026nbspis the only way to maintain a frictionless border\u0026nbsppost-Brexit.Ms Foster told reporters at Stormont there had been a “useful engagement” with the prime minister where the party reminded Ms May of their opposition to the Irish backstop, as the DUP believe it creates ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.She said: “We reiterated again the fact that the backstop was the problem in relation to the withdrawal agreement and the Brady amendment that was put down in the House of Commons last week gives her the mandate now to go to Brussels as she intends to\u0026nbspon Thursday and we look forward to hearing the outcome of that.“As I’ve said, the Brady amendment is clear in relation to the withdrawal agreement that the backstop needs to be replaced. That is her mandate and that’s what I expect her to take to Brussels.”Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald warned the prime minister that she risked breaking up the UK if she engaged in brinkmanship with the EU.She said: “We have told her that the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong.“We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland or Irish people, that those days are over and will not return.”She accused Ms May of acting in “absolute bad faith”, adding:\u0026nbsp“If British politicians cannot accept the specific needs of this country, of the Northern Irish, if British politics is incapable of acknowledging and upholding the Good Friday Agreement and the hardening of the border, then the only last option – the backstop of last resort – is a referendum on Irish unity.”Naomi Long, leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, said\u0026nbspthe prime minister\u0026nbspgave no detail about what the “alternative arrangements” could be to replace the backstop in their meeting.‘We’re totally in the dark’ – Belfast locals on BrexitShe went on: “I am tired of people chasing unicorns. It has to stop, we don’t have time.“We need practical solutions that are going to actually address the realities that we are facing.”UUP leader Robin Swann said if Ms May cannot negotiate an extension and no deal is reached, then she must introduce direct rule for Northern Ireland.And SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that his party had told Ms May that it is now time to “put up or shut up”, as the backstop was only viable solution to the border issue.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The country’s future is at stake, and it’s about time the national interest took priority.”But the political logjam over Brexit appears to be putting the government’s legislation on hold in the aftermath of Theresa May’s deal being crushed by a historic margin.And given the lack of an agreed deal at Westminster – or knowledge of what the deal will eventually entail – it is difficult for the prime minister to make progress with five Brexit-related laws, including the fisheries bill, the agricultural bill, and the financial services bill.\u0027Special place in hell\u0027 for pro-Brexit campaigners, Tusk saysThis is why in recent weeks cabinet ministers such as the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, have suggested the government may need to delay Brexit by a few weeks in order to pass critical legislation – if Ms May eventually cobbles together a majority for an exit deal.Asked about the adjournment of the Commons at 3.27pm, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: The business of the House is set out in advance, there have been days recently where they have been working beyond midnight dealing with statements and with debates on Brexit.I think this week they have been dealing with some important domestic statutory instruments and other significant issues which are going to be debated in the coming days.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

The first that person will know about it is when someone bangs on their door in the early hours of the morning to bundle them into an immigration enforcement van and take them to a detention centre.Algerian man dies in London immigration detention centreGovernment plans risk ‘riding roughshod’ over rights of immigrantsSuicides in immigration removal centres kept ‘state secret’, MPs told“Those we get to hear about are probably only the tip of the iceberg, but we do know that £21m was paid out by the Home Office in just five years to compensate for wrongful detention, and terrible mistakes are certainly what happened in the Windrush cases.”The committee said it had looked at the Home Office files of Windrush citizens who had been unable to prove their UK residence, and that there was “masses” of evidence, including records of national insurance contributions going back decades.“If there had been any independence in the decision making, these people would never have been detained, yet they were detained not once but twice. The papers in their files were ignored, and the pleas of their families were swept aside,” Ms Harman added.“After the right to life, the right not to be unlawfully detained is one of the most important human rights. It should not be the case that a person has fewer protections from wrongful detention as an immigrant than they would if they had actually committed a crime.”The MPs also said detainees should have better and more consistent access to legal aid to challenge their detention, and that a reinstatement of legal aid for immigration cases should be considered.UN backs calls for time limit on UK immigration detentionSam Grant, policy and campaigns manager for Liberty, supported the calls, describing indefinite detention as an “ineffective and inefficient waste of money and human life”.\u0026nbspBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, also backed the calls, saying\u0026nbspa 28-day time limit was “urgently” needed along with early judicial oversight and safeguards against “cat and mouse” re-detentions.“The JCHR has expertly laid bare the injustice and abuse inherent in our current system. Parliament will have the opportunity to take this historic step when it considers the immigration bill and we urge MPs of all parties to take it,” she added.Leila Zadeh, executive director of UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group, welcomed the report but called for the government to bring an end to the detention of LGBT+ people, saying it was “wholly inappropriate”“They run a significant risk of being locked up among other people who may display the same discriminatory attitudes and hostility from which they have fled. They also frequently struggle to be granted refugee status if they have to make their asylum applications from inside a detention centre,” she added.The Home Office has been approached for comment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereAsylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.As the People\u0027s Vote campaign and The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign gain traction, 700,000 people turn out in London to demand a final say on the UK\u0027s Brexit deal on October 20 2018As the Prime Minister settles on a Brexit deal, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab resigns along with Work and Pensions secretary Esther McVey and many other ministers3540 Final Say petitions delivered to Downing StreetPeople\u0027s Vote supporting MPs Chukka Umunna, Justine Greening and Caroline Lucas and The Independent editor Christian Broughton deliver over a million signatures in favour of a People\u0027s Vote to the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street on December 3 2018On December 10, the Prime Minister delayed the vote on her Brexit deal as it was near certain not to pass through the Commons due to Tory rebels and lack of DUP supportTory MPs triggered a confidence vote in the Prime Minister on December 12. She won by 200 votes to 1173840 Commons rejects the dealFollowing the delay, the Prime Minister\u0027s deal was rejected in the Commons by a historic 230 votes 3940 Corbyn tables a no confidence motionFollowing the rejection of the Prime Minister\u0027s deal, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence in the government, which the government won by a margin of 19The Prime Minister won the support of the commons to return to Brussels to renegotiate the backstop on January 29. In the same sitting, MPs also voted against a no-deal Brexit in a non-legally binding motionHe states: “This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tariff and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals.“We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.”The letter comes as Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said there was a “special place in hell” for politicians who had sold the idea of Brexit without thinking through the consequences.Downing Street hit back angrily as a range of politicians all spoke about against Mr Tusk’s comments.The president of the European Council did however repeat the EU position that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, echoed the message in a joint statement with Leo Varadkar, saying: “We cannot accept the idea, which is circulating around, that the withdrawal agreement could be reopened.”Ms May will be meeting with European leaders in the coming days to discuss the withdrawal agreement and in his\u0026nbspletter\u0026nbspMr Corbyn said he understood that any negotiation would require “flexibility and compromise”.Despite the EU’s position of not reopening the negotiations, Mr Corbyn’s letter called on Ms May to secure a number of changes.“Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK,” the letter says.Labour also want a close alignment with the single market “underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, with clear arrangements for dispute resolution” as well participation in EU agencies and funding programmes. However it notably drops Labour’s previous demand to secure the\u0026nbsp”exact same benefits” of the single market.There are also calls for “unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases”.Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In his first interview since announcing his run for prime minister, he cited the dismantling of settlements in Gaza in 2005 as an example that could be replicated in the West Bank.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“All sides had a lot at stake and the state managed to do it without tearing the country apart. It was done legally, carried out by the State of Israel and the IDF, and even though it was very painful for the settlers, it was handled well,” he said.“We must take the lessons of the disengagement and implement them in other arenas.”Many Israelis consider the Gaza disengagement under then prime minister Ariel Sharon a historic mistake that emboldened the Islamist group Hamas.Created with Sketch.Palestinians await Israeli demolition of their homes in the West Bank  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Children play as their parents prepare for their homes to be destroyed (Bel Trew)A toddler plays in the dirt of Khan al-Ahmar village (Bel Trew)Palestinian flags festoon the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar as they await eviction (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents brace themselves for the bulldozers (Bel Trew)Iman, 7, says she does not want to leave her home (Bel Trew)The demolition order includes the village’s school, which provides education for some 170 children from five different Bedouin communities.\u0026nbsp(Bel Trew)The playground of the school which will likely be demolished in the coming days (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents prepare for their homes to be destroyed (Bel Trew)A toddler plays in the dirt of Khan al-Ahmar village (Bel Trew)Palestinian flags festoon the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar as they await eviction (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents brace themselves for the bulldozers (Bel Trew)Iman, 7, says she does not want to leave her home (Bel Trew)The demolition order includes the village’s school, which provides education for some 170 children from five different Bedouin communities.\u0026nbsp(Bel Trew)The playground of the school which will likely be demolished in the coming days (Bel Trew)But the continued growth of settlements in the West Bank is seen as one of the greatest barriers to an eventual peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 400,000 Israelis live in the territory, and a further 200,000 in East Jerusalem, both of which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Most of the international community views settlements as illegal – in 2016 the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that described them as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Palestinians argue they harm the chances of a two-state solution by taking land that would eventually make up a Palestinian state.Settlement construction has surged under Donald Trump, who has taken a more relaxed approach to the issue than previous presidents. Data compiled by Peace Now, an advocacy group in Israel, found that construction had risen 20 per cent in the first nine months of 2018, compared with the year before.Speaking on Tuesday, the UN secretary general\u0026nbspAntonio Guterres\u0026nbspdescribed settlements as “a major obstacle to peace”, which should be “halted and reversed”.“Ongoing settlement construction and expansion in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under United Nations resolutions and international law,” he said. “A two-state solution is the only way to achieve the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and secure a sustainable solution to the conflict.”According to current polling, Mr Gantz is expected to win about 24 seats in the Knesset, trailing Mr Netanyahu’s Likud\u0026nbspby six seats.The former general,\u0026nbspfrequently described as “charismatic” in profiles,\u0026nbspwas the Israeli army’s chief of staff during the 2014 Gaza war, codenamed Operation Protective Edge. Mr Gantz has highlighted his role in the war in promotional material for his campaign.Israel launched the military operation in the Gaza Strip following the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members. The subsequent war left more than 2,200 Palestinians dead.“Sixty-three per cent, or 1,391, did not take part in the fighting, including 526 minors,” according to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. “It is estimated that 18,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged and that more than 100,000 Palestinians were rendered homeless.” \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

eu","story":"So, what would a No-Deal Brexit mean for the UK  Heres what we know so far.A no-deal British departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers are seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations are ongoing under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ahead of the UKs exit on March , .Some fear these talks could collapse without a deal agreed before the deadline.This could mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisationrules.On January , Boris Johnson claimed that a No-Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.A poll by YouGov on January  revealed that  per cent of the British public think a No-Deal Brexit it likely,  per cent thinks a failed deal will result in a second referendum,  per cent the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.Mrs May is fighting back against opponents of her blueprint for Brexit, saying Parliament will have to choose between her proposal and crashing out of the European Union without a deal.It would mean scrapping a -month transition period lasting until the end of , and the exit would be immediate.Brexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No-Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No-Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to the Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.Theresa May announced on January  that a vote on her EU Withdrawal deal will take place on Tuesday, January , which was rejected  to .May has guaranteed MPs a vote on whether the controversial Brexit backstop is triggeredthe UK fails to conclude a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.She unveiled her plan B Brexit plan on January  and vowed to have another go with solving the issue of the back stop.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No-Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Ministers announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No-Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Businesses receive a -page document, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government over the next few days.The news comes as:Theresa May’s Government plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.Aides of Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed he would call on colleagues on Tuesday to dramatically accelerate No-Deal planning given the deadlock over the PM’s Brexit deal.The Sun can revealed he ‘activated’ the NHS’ own plans – amid spiralling fears key medicines could be caught up in chaos at the border.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No-Deal.As bitter Brexit battles rage on:Businesses received a -page document about Brexit, with a total of , firms likely to hear

compromise","story":"It would mean extending the transition period from the end of  to December  but with the UK following EU rules and paying an extra £billion into Brussels coffers.It would also mean replacing the Irish backstop with technological solutions while leaving the option open of exiting the EU on World Trade Organisation rules –a free-trade deal has not been struck.The idea was named after housing minister Kit Malthouse, who brought the two sides together in secret. Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do they not want Britain to succeed Do they not see that their bizarre, condescending attitude is EXACTLY why they lost in  THE rocketing suicide rate amongst teenagers is nothing short of a national crisis.And the solution MUST involve the social media firms who are profiting from youngsters’ suffering.They have been given quite enough warning that they are not doing enough to protect vulnerable kids.They have said for years that they just need a bit more time, and that they’d fix the problem themselves.Well, they’ve failed.Government has no choice but to step in – and it needs a concerted effort from the Education, Health and Culture Departments.One more tragic death is one too many.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.’“He writes her a really long letter in , and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her.“She feels like, ‘That’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said ’“It’s almost like they’re ships passing.“He knows how to get in touch with her.“It’s super-painful because Meg was always so dutul.“I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done. At the same time, because she’s a daughter, she has a lot of sympathy for him.”The close friends spoke anonymously to US magazine People after Thomas made a string of public outbursts about his royal daughter and Meghan’s half-sister Samantha cashed in on their “non-existent” relationship.The Sun understands the pals spoke to People with Meghan’s approval, and that her press team at Kensington Palace were kept in the dark.One friend said: “Meg has sat silently back and endured the lies and untruths.“We want to stand up against the global bullying we are seeing and speak the truth about who our friend, a  mother-to-be, really is.“We worry about what this is doing to her and the baby. It’s wrong to put anyone under this level of emotional trauma, let alone when they’re pregnant.”The pals vehemently defend the Duchess and reveal she was devastated by her father’s response to her letter and did not talk to him after that.They also claim that:They said Thomas’s older children, Thomas Markle Junior and Samantha Grant, “were in their mid-to-late teens when  Meghan was born” and “were not a part of her le”.The friend added: “They’ve been made to appear as siblings who were very close and then they had this falling out, and that’s not the truth at all.“Fast-forward to Meghan dating Harry and now Samantha isname Markle. And then she began this career capitalising on Meg.“Everyone who knows Meg knows the two of them have no relationship.”The same friend also gave Meghan’s side of the story, after her dad Thomas pulled out of walking her down the aisle at the royal wedding due to a heart attack.They told the magazine Meghan had looked after her father financially, despite what  Samantha had claimed.They said: “Meghan’s been a rock for everyone in her family.“It’s a shame that it’s being painted in this other light that is just absolutely .“She took care of her father with such incredible generosity.“The fact that this could be flipped around, that she was acting out or not caring for him, is preposterous.“The Saturday before the wedding, she and Harry were told that a story was going to come out the next day saying that Tom was staging pictures with the paparazzi.“Their team told them thatthe story was fake, they could file a complaint.“So Meg calls Tom and asks him, and he’s swearing up and down that it’s not true. The next day the pictures come out.“Even with all that, Meg and Harry were still so focused on getting him to London.“At no point was there talk of, ‘Now that we know he lied, he’s in trouble’.“Tom wouldn’t take her calls, wouldn’t take Harry’s calls.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

In a bombshell letter  days before Brexit, the Labour leader has shted his red lines and offered Theresa May a clear way to leave the EU.It means Mrs May can get a Commons majority for her dealshe pivots to back a customs union with the EU. But firstly, thats a hugethat could split the Tories. Secondly, it throws a huge spanner in the works hours before the Prime Minister meets EU chiefs in Brussels today.And thirdly, its enraged some Labour MPs who want Jeremy Corbyn to stop helping the government push through Brexit - and back a second EU referendum instead.So what is new today, how has Labour changed its position, and why are Remainer MPs angry  Heres our guide - and the letter in full. What is Jeremy Corbyns offer   Labours leader has written a letter to Theresa May, saying he WILL back her on a Brexit dealit meets five demands: A permanent, UK-wide customs union with the EU Close alignment with the EU single market Dynamic alignment on rights and protections, so UK standards keep pace with new ones in the EU Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies Unambiguous agreements on future security Mr Corbyn has already held talks with the Prime Minister and more are expected to follow. He promises to discuss his proposal with her in a constructive way to secure a sensible agreement. He says compromise is now needed to please both the EU and the House of Commons, which voted down the -page Brexit deal by a record majority last month. How has his position changed  Firstly, the letter means Labour has officially ditched its six tests a Brexit deal would have to meet before being backed. The tests were unveiled in March  and included ambitions that were obviously impossible - such as securing the exact same benefits the UK currently has.They were derided as bollocks by Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner. Today the very same Mr Gardiner told the BBC: Its not about tests now. What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons.Secondly, it means Labour is putting calls for a second EU referendum firmly on the back burner - despite huge pressure within the party.Labour pledged to keep a second EU referendum as an option on the table thanks to a motion at the party conference last year. Remainers say Labour should campaigning for that public vote NOW, having failed to force a general election. But Jeremy Corbyn is against it.Thirdly, there is no mention in the letter of delaying Brexit. Labour has said extending the March  date may be inevitable. But this shows the party is still striving to help get a soft Brexit through as soon as it can.Why are Labour MPs furious  Labour Remain-backers have voiced their fury at Jeremy Corbyn for - in their words - enabling Brexit.They want him to back a second EU referendum instead. And the words of Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner, who quoted Theresa May herself, wont help. He said: Jeremy is trying to set out what we believe is needed to make a success of Brexit. Labour MP Chuka Umunna blasted: This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer. Labour MP Owen Smith said: “Backing Brexit - even on these terms —- would still shrink our economy, cost jobs and lost investment, indulge nativist nostalgia and isolationism. Fellow Remainer MP Chris Leslie said: “Seriously  Offering to help Tory Govt enable Brexit  It’s not just Labour’s conference policy in the bin. When the jobs go  revenues for services dry up as a result, Labour’s leadership will have ZERO right to complain: they share responsibility.” Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi wrote sarcastically: Nice to be briefed about this @UKLabour @WelshLabour. If at ANY point you would like to consult MPs and also take the Labour Party conference motion into consideration... Just let me know... Cheers... Why is it a game changer  For the first time, it means Theresa May doesnt need to change the backstop - or appease Tory Brexiteers - to get her deal through.The backstop is an insurance clause that would trap the UK under EU customs rules from , in exchange for keeping the Irish border open. The Prime Minister is meeting EU chiefs in Brussels today to try and tweak the clause. Shes done that because Tory Brexiteers said otherwise, theres no way they would pass the Brexit deal. Yet EU chiefs say they wont change the backstop, leaving talks deadlocked. Now Labour claims it has a way out by offering that permanent customs union - arranged, crucially, through the future framework and not the -page exit deal that contains the backstop. If she backs it, Labour claims, Theresa May wont need Tory Brexiteer help to get a Commons majority. Barry Gardiner said: What were saying is actually you can do this another way. What you can do is say lets look at the future political framework, andthe future political framework were agreed now between the EU and ourselves to be a customs union, then actually theres no problem at that point when you get to the end of the transition period, because youre already in a customs union and therefore you dont need the backstop. But why is it still a long shot   Theresa May has made clear she wants to be able to strike trade deals around the world. If the UK is in a full customs union with the EU, it cant do that effectively. And Labour proposed a customs union before - only to be defeated in the House of Commons. Evenshe did fold and accept a customs union, the row over it could split Theresa Mays party for good. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg once warned of a revolt the size of that over the Victorian-era Corn Laws. What happens next   Theresa May is meeting EU chiefs including Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels today. Theyre likely to brush her off, a day after saying Tory Brexiteers who had no plan have a special place in hell. Then shes travelling to Dublin on Friday night for dinner with Irish premier Leo Varadkar. Hes likely to brush her off too. But in between and afterwards, theres a window for talks with Jeremy Corbyn and his top team about the offer. David Lidington, her de facto deputy, said there would be a channel open to Labour. Shes unlikely to have a new deal ready by next week, meaning MPs will get a vote directing the way forward on February . That could bind her hands, delay Brexit, or just leave us in more deadlock as time ticks down to March . The letter in full  Dear Prime Minister, Thank you for taking the time to meet last week to discuss the Brexit negotiation and our alternative approaches to finding a deal that can command support in Parliament and be negotiated with the EU. There is, as was demonstrated last week, a clear majority in Parliament that no deal must now be taken off the table and that there can be noto a hard border in Northern Ireland in any circumstance. We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the Withdrawal Agreement, as we discussed when we met. However, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in Parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs. As you have said many times before, the EU has been clear that any withdrawal agreement would need to include a backstop to guarantee noto a hard border on the island of Ireland. Labour has long argued that the Government should change its negotiating red lines and seek signicant changes to the Political Declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU. That would also ensure that any backstop would be far less likely to be invoked. The changes we would need to see include: * A permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union. This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tarf and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals. We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. As you are aware, a customs union is supported by most businesses and trade unions. * Close alignment with the Single Market. This should be underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, with clear arrangements for dispute resolution. * Dynamic alignment on rights and protections so that UK standards keep pace with evolving standards across Europe as a minimum, allowing the UK to lead the way. * Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation. * Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases. We believe these negotiating objectives need to be enshrined in law before the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty for businesses and a clear framework for our future relationship. We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise. Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK. That approach should guide how alignment with EU regulations is to be maintained in future, as well discussions on dispute resolution, the role of the ECJ, and competition and migration rules. EU leaders have been clear that such changes to the Political Declaration and a closer relationship are possiblesuch a request is made by the UK government andthe current red lines change. We believe that a close economic relationship along these lines would make it far less likely that any backstop arrangements would ever be needed. The Government’s failure to secure a deal that can command the support of Parliament means time has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised. Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of ‘no deal’, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome. My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn MP Leader of the Opposition "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa bid mend uks ties","story":"NewsBrexit: Theresa May flies into Brussels to beg for help after Tusks hell jibeThe Prime Minister flew into Brussels to beg the bloc’s bosses to overhaul the controversial backstop issue so she can force a deal through ParliamentShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video brexiteers-special-place-hell-declares-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May was attempting to smooth over cracks in the UK’s fractured relationship with Brussels today after EU chief Donald Tusk declared there was a “special place in hell” for Brexiteer politicians. The Prime Minister flew into Brussels to beg the bloc’s bosses to overhaul the controversial backstop issue so she can force a deal through Parliament. But Downing Street was downbeat about her chances of success with one No  insider predicting: “We know they’ll say no.” With just  days to go until Brexit Day, negotiations remain deadlocked and frustration in Brussels is mounting. Mr Tusk, President of the European Council, unleashed a furious tirade at Brexiteers who he claimed had convinced the British public to quit without knowing what would follow.  “I have been wondering what that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan to carry it out safely,” he said. He also took a swipe at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - saying there was “no effective leadership” in the UK that would allow Brexit to be reversed. After making his comments Mr Tusk laughed and nodded as Ireland’s Leo Varadkar told him: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.” Furious Leave supporting MPs lashed out at the former Polish PM. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said he should apologise for his “spiteful” remarks while Sammy Wilson, the DUP Brexit spokesman, described him as a “devilish Euro maniac”. Mrs May’s official spokesman told reporters: “I think it is a question for Donald Tusk as to whether he considers the use of that kind of language to be helpful.”   No  sees the trip - the first since the PMs deal was resoundingly rejected by MPs - as “part of a process” but it was unclear whether she had any detailed new proposals to put forward. There are three options under consideration - replacing the backstop with “alternative” arrangements, imposing a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism. The Mirror understands that the PM’s senior Brexit advisor Oliver Robbins has told ministers that a deal can be struck on a time limit to the backstop. In a private document drawn up before Christmas, he wrote: “Our advice is that a unilateral termination mechanism is likely to be rejected in strong terms, and lead to a prolonged hiatus. “A termination clause without a unilateral mechanism may be negotiable, but will need to be relatively simpleit is to be concluded quickly... “If we are pursuing a termination by mutual consent, this will still not be easy, but a discussion with the Irish government and Commission in parallel might be the best way forward.” The proposal is dependent on the Irish PM agreeing to accept a sunset clause. Mrs May will travel to Dublin on Friday evening for dinner with Mr Varadkar.  Ahead of today’s talks, Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the withdrawal agreement was not open for renegotiation. “She knows that the Commission is not prepared to reopen the issue,” he said. At Westminster, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said that Brexit Day should be delayed to give negotiations more time. Cabinet ministers have held secret talks about delaying Brexit Day by two months - but were slapped down by the PM at this week’s Cabinet. Brussels insiders confirmed they may be prepared to offer a “period of grace”the PM’s deal passes to allow extra time to get key legislation through. Ministers came under fire last night after the House of Commons rose more than four hours early despite Brexit uncertainty. Labour’s Diana Johnson said the situation was “bang out of order”. She added: “Considering Brexit is just  days away this is totally irresponsible!” SNP chief whip Patrick Gray said: “Seemingly the Tory Government thinks there’s nothing worth debating or discussing.” The Government has cancelled the February recess for MPs with six key bills to get through before March . One No  insider suggested they would “pull out all the stops” including sitting through the night to get the two essential bits of legislation through in time. There were suggestions that ministers could publish a new employment bill before the next vote on the PM’s deal to win over more Labour MPs. The Mirror revealed last month that Downing Street was offering guarantees on workers’ rights - and it has also hinted at extra funding for Leave-voting Labour areas. Labour MP Lisa Nandy told BBC radio that up to  Labour MPs could be prepared to back a revised deal. Senior Labour insiders suggested the figure could be nearer a dozen. Earlier, Mrs May held crunch talks with Northern Ireland political leaders. Sinn Fein warned that Brexit should trigger an Irish unication referendum which could split the UK. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald said: “If British politicians cannot accept the specic needs of this country, of the north of Ireland,British politics is incapable of acknowledging and upholding the Good Friday Agreement and preventing the hardening of the border, then the only last option – the backstop of last resort – is a referendum on Irish unity.” The warning capped a frustrating morning for the PM with the Northern Irish parties claiming they still had no idea what strategy she would pursue. Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist SDLP, claimed there “is no magical solution” for technology to prevent a hard border. “We need to get over all this messing around,” he said. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said Mrs May failed to set out which of the three options she will pursue with EU chiefs. “I’m tired of people chasing unicorns. It has to stop, we don’t have time,” she added.

Thousands of pages of UK laws need updating to cope with Britains departure from the EU, and theyll need scrutinising by MPs by the end of March. But we guess thats a job for another day.  Labours Diana Johnson said the situation was bang out of order, writing on Twitter : Considering Brexit is just  days away this is totally irresponsible! SNP chief whip Patrick Gray said: Seemingly the Tory Government thinks theres nothing worth debating or discussing.Proceedings began with Cabinet Office questions followed by Prime Ministers Questions. Ten minutes were then used up by the introduction of a backbench bill, before a debate on two social security motions. The adjournment debate focused on prostate cancer and started at .pm rather than pm, as would normally be the case. Elsewhere in Parliament, MPs were involved in afternoon debates in Westminster Hall - their second debating chamber - while proceedings in the House of Lords chamber began at pm and were predicted to run until pm.   The Government last week announced it was cancelling the February recess for MPs, and legislation connected to Brexit still has to be approved. Valerie Vaz, Labours Shadow Commons Leader said: “Theresa Mays zombie Government continues lurching from one crisis to the next. While the Government has been locked in bitter infighting and chaos over their botched Brexit negotiations, the needs of the country have been completely neglected. “This Government has no vision, no new ideas and crucially no legislation to fill the Parliamentary timetable.Best for Britain supporter and Labour MP Virendra Sharma said: “This is not on. Parliament still has tons of legislation to get through before the end of March, including thousands of pages of statutory instruments.   “Brexit is the most important legislative and political process since the Second World War. It makes no sense to go home and avoid working on ensuring the country’s future when there’s so little time left.”Downing Street insisted there was a lot of work going on. The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: The business of the House is set out in advance, there have been days recently where they have been working beyond midnight dealing with statements and with debates on Brexit.   I think this week they have been dealing with some important domestic statutory instruments and other signicant issues which are going to be debated in the coming days.

Adrian Hoare, , is accused of doing nothing when -year-old Stephen Waterson allegedly squashed three-year-old Alfie Lamb during a trip in his Audi convertible last February. Testying at the Old Bailey, she said she was scared of Waterson - and felt little when he bragged about his important family. Waterson was previously accused in court of using the fact his father is ex-Tory minister Nigel Waterson to make himself untouchable. She said she called her son my little noodle and fatpants. Hoare said: Hewas good with him. They had a bond as well. She said that Waterson also had a nickname for Alfie, calling him Tarzan. Asked about another name used for Alfie and she replied: Little s***.  Katy Thorne, QC, defending Hoare, asked: What about the name little s***  She replied: It was just another name it was not to be nasty or horrible it was just another name. Hoare told the court that both her and Waterson had hit Alfie in the past but only little taps. Waterson told the Old Bailey he lied to police after the incident because he was worried that he would get in trouble because the driver of the car, Marcus Lamb, had been disqualied. He told emergency operators he had been driving by and stopped to help try and revive Alfie.  The couple then claimed Alfie had been injured in a taxi which had driven off. A message sent from Hoare to Waterson just hours after the incident at .pm on February  of last year was read to the jury. It said: They know that we are lying. Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting,said: Even before you had reached the hospital you did not know what lies she had told the police, you were trying to get her alone and away from the police. Waterson answered: No-one was allowed in the room with Alfie, Alfie was with doctors. I did not know what lies she had told the police.  Mr Atkinson said: You were trying to get her alone. Waterson asked him: Is it a crime to be alone with your partner  He added: I have already admitted lying in the beginning, I have pleaded guilty to it, lies were told, I did not want to get anyone in trouble. Waterson is accused of deliberately moving his seat back because he was annoyed at Alfies crying. Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Hoare said she felt scared when her partner was annoyed or angry, adding: You never knew how he was going to react to things. The hairdresser told jurors how police had been called after an incident in Gravesend, Kent, the year before Alfie died. She said she had been at a friends house when she heard Waterson had been seeing another woman. I asked him over the phone what was going on and we started arguing. He had come down to Gravesend in the car and asked me to go and speak to him. I had gone to speak to him and he had said that to me to get in the car. He started driving stupidly and he was shouting at mehe did not carehe killed us in the car. He was driving at speed and he did not carethere was other cars coming towards him or anything, she said.  Katy Thorne QC, defending, asked: When he said he did not carehe killed us, who was us  Hoare replied: I had just found out I was pregnant at the time. He was saying himself, me and the baby. She went on: I was scared and I eventually got him to stop the car. He then took me back down to near where my friends car was and went back to her house to speak to the police. My friends had been ringing Stephens phone trying to get him to take me back to the house and saying they would ring the policehe didnt.  Ms Thorne asked Hoareshe knew Watersons family had some important jobs. Hoare replied: He used to put it in conversation, yeah. Asked how it made her feel, she said: Little compared to him but I didnt really have anything. Hoare described Alfie as like any normal three-and-a-half-year-old boy. The defendant, who had a troubled upbringing in Gravesend, said: He could be naughty. He would try to climb about. He had a good imagination. Hoare said she used to call Alfie her little noodle and fat pants, while Waterson used the nickname Tarzan.  On February  last year, Alfie was captured on CCTV running around and holding his mothers hand. Hoare said Alfie had been happy on the shopping trip but began getting tired and stroppy. On Watersons relationship with her son, Hoare said: There had been times that Stephen had told him not to do something or he would tell him to be quiet and Alfie would not listen so he had got annoyed with him sometimes. Hoare denied she had hit her son, but said both she and Waterson would tap his hand. She told how she met Waterson in  after she moved to Blackpool for a fresh start. Her previous boyfriend was jailed for setting fire to her house in Gravesend, jurors were told.  Waterson had a big personality and was nice but did not like her speaking to other people, she said. Hoare suspected he had been unfaithful with ious women during their relationship. But she said: When I confronted him with it, he said I was being silly, I was being paranoid. Hoare and Waterson, of Croydon, south London, have denied manslaughter and the trial continues.

Adam Lamb said the teen smiled at him and was chewing her sleeve as she walked past him in the street in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on May , . He had closed a car door to make it easier for her to pass, reports Nottinghamshire Live. She smiled asto say thanks. She was chewing her sleeve and walked along Westfield Lane, he told the inquest. She was looking into the bushes asshe was going inside them and then she was gone. After a TV appeal, Mr Lamb dialled  the next night and passed on details, saying he believed she was aged between nine or .  Chief superintendent Rob Grfin, for Nottinghamshire Police, who is responsible for missing person teams, said police officers spoke to Mr Lamb, but he was among many callers who reported sightings although they did not know her. Unfortunately the officers didnt ask Mr Lamb to take them to the scene and conduct a more thorough search, he said. Mr Lamb was like many others who describes a person who generally fits the bill for Amber rather than I know Amber. The bushes were dense and Mr Grfin said officers would have been forgiventhey had not found her hanged. A pathologist said there was no evidence others were involved in her death.  The inquest was told Ambers mother suspected her of attention seeking on the night she left home. PC Nicola Roe filled in a missing person form while speaking to mother Kelly Peat. She was told Amber had been asked to empty a cool box, was not happy about it and left. Assistant Coroner Laurinda Bower, who is conducting the hearing at the Council House in the city, asked about her observations of Mrs Peat. She seemed matter of fact when she was describing the situation, the officer said. The coroner asked: Did that surprise you  The officer said: Not really, to be honest. She seemed not particularly emotional or upset, maybe frustrated.  She described her background, referred to Amber throwing temper tantrums, what she called attention seeking. Mrs Peat said Amber had gone missing before and ed home safely.The mother seemed well rehearsed in giving information the officer said. PC Roe told the coroner: They expected her back the next morning. The coroner askedshe knew the family went to Tesco and had their tea before alerting the police that Amber was missing. PC Roe answered: I dont remember being told that or discussing specics with them. The inquest heard Ambers case was initially classed as medium risk by Nottinghamshire Police. When she had disappeared before while living in Derbyshire, that force graded them as high given her personal circumstances the coroner said. The inquest continues.

Sun lovers Laurel Cormack and David Crook say the luxury five-star resort in Corfu looked like a swamp. They had been looking forward to spending two weeks at TUIs Mayor Verde Grand Resort in Agios Gordios, which has a well-publicised private beach. However when the couple got there they found the usually golden sands littered with towering ft-wide smelly seaweed mounds buzzing with flies. David claims they were only able to spend half a day on the hotel beach and had to abandon their sunbeds due to the seaweed-choked waters and head to the crowded hotel pool.   The recruitment consultant blasted TUIs cavalier attitude to their complaints and for failing to inform guests of the natural phenomenon in advance so they could make alternative plans. TUI said they were sorry to hear of their disappointment and would be in contact with them again. David, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said: Were very much beach people and always book hotels with their own piece of beach with them. If were relaxing we prefer to sit on the beach rather than by the pool as it always gets crowded. The black seaweed was in very long strips andyou put your foot in it it would stick to your legs. In the water it was ft deep.   The seaweed was smelly and had a lot of flies around it, the water wasnt clear either. The holiday wasnt as good as it could have been as the one facility we paid for [the beach], the whole reason we picked that hotel, we werent able to take advantage of. When we booked the holiday online I was expecting the golden sands I saw in the brochure, not mounds of stinking seaweed. The -year-old said both he and his customer service assistant we Laurel, , were taunted by glossy promotional videos displayed in the hotel showcasing the resorts unspoiled beaches.  David said: The really irritating thing was in the main reception they had a big -inch TV with a continuous looped video. It kept showing all the bits of the hotel that wed booked the holiday for and werent able to use because they were seaweeded out. They were even playing in the lts and showing the same thing - we couldnt get away from them. Grandad-of-one David said that diggers were out at am scooping up the seaweed from the sand and dumping it in mounds on the hotel area of the beach instead of taking it away. David said: When we complained about it the TUI rep shrugged her shoulders and said theres nothing we can do, the hotel and local authority is doing all they can.  The diggers were there a couple of hours from am on a few mornings trying to clear the beach but as fast as they moved it the seaweed ed. They werent removing it though just piling it up, it was an eyesore. Apparently a couple of weeks before we were there there was a dredger that took away about  tonnes of seaweed. We werent there for that but you dont order a dredger and get diggers on the beachits not a problem. We could have used the less affected public beach further along but that would have entailed paying for sunbeds, parasols and snacks which defeats the object of going all inclusive. Our argument has always been never about assigning blame or responsibility for the seaweed. Its a natural phenomena, its not the hotel or TUIs fault and I never said it was.  What I was really incensed about was the fact that all theyre doing is hiding behind it being a natural phenomena. It first started at the end of March and we went in June - theyd known about this for three months. Do they not monitor their resorts for this type of event  Do they not noty customers  If wed had an informed choice we wouldnt have cancelled our holiday, but we would have just gone to a dferent resort not affected by it. I dont want a load of money back, I just want them to hold their hands up and admit its something they should have made people aware of.  I wouldnt want other people to go through the experience, its just wrong. David complained to TUI in writing and said he was disappointed with their response - even receiving a missive thoughtlessly sent out. David said: I had an email from one TUI rep again explaining it was a natural phenomenon and that she was sorry about the incontinence this has caused. My first thought was that the email hadnt been put through spell check or checked for any autocorrects it was just speedily bashed out with little or no thought. Ive also tried speaking to them on the phone and on one glorious occasion was on hold for  minutes listening to a continuous loop of the same song - by the end of it I was losing the will to live. Dad-of-two David said the experience had put him off booking a TUI holiday in the future. David said: The cavalier attitude TUI took has meant that we will never use them again and nor would we recommend them. The amount we paid might not be a lot of money to a lot of people, but its a big chunk of money for us. Were not wealthy people were just normal working people - its our two weeks of rest and relaxation. TUIs whole attitude really disappointed me, its just left a really bad taste in the mouth. I never said it was their fault, all I was saying was do you not monitor your resorts for this kind of occurrences to let people know so they can make an informed choice about whether they want to proceed with it or not  A TUI spokesman said: Were sorry to hear of the Cormack partys disappointment and we will be in contact the customers directly once again to discuss in further detail.

And within just a few hours David Mearns managed to track down the missing Piper Malibu on Sunday, which was on its way to Cardf when it disappeared last month.Sala’s family appealed to the marine scientist after an official search for the aircraft was stood down and an online crowdfunding campaign to fund it raised more than pound,. But those who know David were not remotely surprised the man known as The Shipwreck Hunter was able to locate the plane so quickly. The expert, who was born in the US but is now a British citizen living in Sussex, has helped solve some of history’s greatest maritime mysteries.   He has lead searches for shipwrecks that have been at the bottom of the sea of decades, even centuries, making  major historical discoveries over the last  years. Using sonar technology and remote-controlled submarines, his expeditions have also set records for finding wrecks at extreme depths - and even helped solve crimes that would have remained forever undetected. But despite his successes he still dreams of finding one wreck which has eluded him - Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance, which crashed into ice and sank off Antartica in .  He told the Times in : “If I could cap it all off with Endurance, I would be a happy, happy man because it is the ultimate shipwreck search in terms of dficulty and challenge.“Harder than Titanic. Finding a deep-water shipwreck in the Weddell Sea when it is covered in ice, you are not going to get any harder than that.” Most of David’s finds, though, have been the result of exceptionally hard work - often years of research, months at sea and millions of pounds. And with three Guinness World Records for underwater discoveries, including one for the deepest shipwreck ever found - the German blockade runner Rio Grande, which was discovered at a depth of ,ft - he is now regarded as the man to turn to when it comes to retrieving from the ocean floor. One of the -year-old’s most famous discoveries was the HMS Hood, one of Britain’s greatest battleships, which was sunk by the German navy’s Bismark in May .  There were just three survivors among the , on board, their lives saved by an air bubble that pushed them back to the surface. Among them was Ted Briggs, who David had met and sought consent from before setting out for a Channel  documentary to find the ship in . He eventually found the wreck at a depth of , ft at the bottom of the Denmark Strait, where he got another Guinness World Record for the deepest live broadcast on the internet, with live footage of the HMS Hood being streamed around the world. But he later recalled how there was none of the usual shouts of excitement when the ship was finally discovered. He said: “There were no whoops or joy of back-slaps. It was such an emotional and sad moment for me. I didn’t feel like celebrating in any way.”  When a plaque was placed on the wreck, now a recognised war grave, he made sure that it was Ted Briggs’ hands in control of an underwater robot when it wasreleased onto the wreck. He remembered: “For Ted personally, it allowed him a chance to say goodbye to his shipmates, to remove from his shoulders the guilt that he had felt his whole le as one of only three who survived. “In a sense, he laid a ghost to rest. It was something that I’ll never ever forget - a very proud moment for everybody that we witnessed that.” Other sunken warships he has found with his company Blue Water Recoveries include the HMAS Sydney, an Australian navy battle cruiser sunk by the Germans off Australias west coast in November , killing . It was the the country’s greatest maritime mystery for  years until he found the ship in . David also found the hospital ship Centaur, which was torpedoed off Queensland by a Japanese submarine in , for which he was awarded an honorary Medal of the Order of Australia.  He was also part of a team in  led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which located the wreckage of the Japanese battleship Msashi in the Sibuyan Sea. And in  he found a wreck he believes to be the SS Athenia, the first ship sunk in the Second World War at a cost of  lives when German U-boat commander Fritz Julius Lemp torpedoed the transatlantic liner – believing it was a warship – just hours after Britain had declared war on the Nazis. Describing his care with such wrecks, where many lives were lost, he said: “The sanctity of those grave sites and whoever has been lost is very important. “They are major unmarked grave sites, with no head stones to show who has been lost there, and that why we take this effort andto put plaques on the wreck, to leave a marker that those people haven’t been forgotten.” David, who trained as a marine biologist, began his career as a search and recovery contractor for the US Navy.  But his le changed forever when he was tasked with finding MV Lucona, a cargo ship which was blown up in the Indian Ocean in  at the cost of six lives. After finding the ship at ,ft, he found it had been blown apart by a bomb for an insurance fraud by Austrian businessman Udo Proksch, who was subsequently convicted in  of murdering six of his crew. He went on to defy the odds by finding dozens of other lost vessels, many of which had been shrouded in mystery for decades, boasting a  per cent success rate. Describing the months he often spends at sea searching for wrecks, he says: “Being on the water is great, I love being out there.  You see some days when it’s call, and days when it’s really mountainous seas. You’re working every minute of every hour when you’re awake.” He says that the discovery he’s most proud of was the SMAS Sydney, which nobody thought would ever be found. He said: “It’s not exaggerating to say that all of Australia was following that search. We had the worst luck, everything went wrong. Equipment failures, bad weather, the ship broke down…” He said he felt “pure exhilaration” when it showed up on his sonar.   In March , David announced the discovery of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gaza’s Esmerelda, which sunk in . It is believed to be the earliest ship from Europe’s Age of Discovery ever to be found and excavated.

Michael Seed, , is alleged to be the raider caught on CCTV wearing a wig and face mask while helping to steal poundmillion worth of gold, jewels and cash. The court was shown footage of the man known as Basil, who police also referred to as Male A, taking something from a pocket seconds before opening the front door of - Hatton Garden. Asked how Basil got in, Det Sgt Jamie Day told the court: “I would suggest either by a key or had access some other way.” Another clip captured the raider on the second floor where the lt was disabled, allowing access to the shaft through which the burglars could climb down to the basement vault.  Jurors were also shown images of cut burglar alarm wires. Prosecutors allege that it was Seed who disabled the alarm. The gang’s loot was stolen from  safe deposit boxes over the  Easter Bank Holiday weekend after a hole was drilled through the vault wall. The court heard five of the six men who were present – Brian Reader, , John “Kenny” Collins, , Daniel Jones, , Carl Wood, , and Terry Perkins, who died last year aged  – have been convicted of conspshyiring to carry out the safe deposit heist in London’s jewellery quarter.  Two miles away police raided Seed’s one-bedroom council flat in Islington last year. He denies two charges of conspshyiracy to commit burglary and one charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property. The trial at Woolwich Crown Court continues.

Now Jacky Rom, from Romford in Essex, is desperate to trace the man caught up in the mix-up, because he was much nicer than the man she ended up meeting. Jackie had arranged to meet a man on dating app Plenty of Fish.When she arrived at the Fox and Raven in Chelmsford, she was excited to be greeted by a man with a twinkle in his eye, Essex Live reports.But sadly for her it turned out the mystery man was supposed to be on a date with someone  - and the mix-up only came to light when their real dates turned up. Now Jacky is desperate to find the man she thought she was meant to be dating.  Jacky, who has a -year-old daughter and has been single for nine months, spent Monday morning preparing for her first ever blind date, dressing to impress. She said: When I pulled up in the car park I saw a guy behind me and thought he looked nice, I did think it was a bit funny that he didnt say hello. I went inside and ordered a drink and sat down, when he walked in he came over to me straight away greeted me with a peck on the cheek and said I thought you were a red head. When he said that I didnt think much of it, because I have always had dferent coloured hair, I just thought I was pleased with my choice.   He had a twinkle in his eye and he was a gentleman, even though I wasnt what he expected when he saw me he said its ok, it doesnt matter. He then went over to the bar and got himself a drink, at which point my actual date walked in. It was only a matter of minutes that Jacky spent with the man she mistook for her date but she said: It didnt even occur to me he was the wrong person I didnt even think of that I thought oh a nice guy for a change. My actual date was no where near as nice as the other man, but we all at that point had realised what had happened and laughed about it. When the red head turned up shortly after the four went their separate ways and continued their dates.   Jacky, who is an author, said: It was so annoying, we were sat there chatting away and I was not giving him my full attention. I was thinking about pretending to go to the toilet and instead running outside and putting my business card on his car windscreen, because I knew what car he had as he followed me in. But after about  minutes they just left and I couldnt do anything, I didnt knowthey had had a good date or not. Jacky has been single for nine months and downloaded Plenty of Fish around a month ago to seeshe could find love, and this was her first ever blind date. She said: Its a shame I had the coffee with the wrong one. I would like the chance I missed. Now, having recovered from the embarrassment, she wants to track down the mystery man.

A teacher of Amber Peat, , Karen Green told an inquest at Nottingham Council House the schoolgirl had mentioned having a big secret. The -year-old was found hanged on June  , three days after leaving home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. Karen Green, vice-principal of the Queen Elizabeth Academy, Mansfield, had a phone call with social services regarding Amber, reports Nottinghamshire Live. She said: My gut instinct is theres something not right here. I cant put my finger on it. She had called seeking help over the -year-old who had recently become a pupil at the school after the move from Derbyshire.  One of Ms Greens comments referred to a big secret, Amber says she is not allowed to talk about it. This was thought to refer to her stepfather Daniel Peats criminal conviction for fraud, the inquest heard. Another phone call mentioned that Amber becomes stressednot allowed access to food in school, giving potential issues around her diet, the coroner Laurinda Bower said. The teacher also spoke about Amber twice running away. The coroner said: There was information that the family moved from the previous school when people started to work with them.  That suggests a potential lack of engagement. Ms Greens call was taken by Elizabeth Fisher, a member of the multi-agency support hub. She said a social worker had to make a decision on stepping up support for Amber and this was not done. I didnt feel there was enough for a full referral, said Miss Fisher, who told the inquest the decision was not hers to make, adding: Social workers are the trained staff. The coroner suggested one factor for a referral for extra care wasparents were involved in crime. She askedthat information passed to a social worker. Miss Fisher replied: I would have told them why dad was in prison.  Amber was found hanged after a family row shortly after they had all ed from a holiday in Cornwall. A pathologist said there was no evidence to suggest anyone  was involved in the hanging. The inquest has previous heard the teenager was woken at midnight for two hours to do cleaning jobs around the house. The hearing was told the teenager was also punished by having to use a carrier bag to take items to class rather than using a school satchel.  The coroner was referring to a phone call from Sharon Clay, a team leader at Queen Elizabeth School, Mansfield. Amber had recently become a pupil after the family moved from Tibshelf. The call was taken by Joanna Shepherd, a member of a multi-agency safeguarding team in Notts. The coroner asked whether this was regarded as emotional abuse. Miss Shepherd, who was giving evidence, said: It could possibly amount to emotional abuse. You would need more detail and content.  The coroner said other information had been compiled about Amber while the family were Derbyshire residents and efforts could have been made to get the bigger picture. The hearing continues.

The QEII Bridge at the Dartford Crossing has been closed for public safety due to overhead winds of over mph and strong crosswinds, Essex Live reports. Southbound traffic on the M will instead have to travel through the East tunnel, which has a height restriction of five metres.

In further travel disruption, the M Severn Bridge in South Gloucestershire was closed in both directions earlier this morning but is now reopened. Overnight winds reached mph on the Isle of Wight, and mph on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall. Meteorologist Mark Wilson told motorists they should take care. He said: Be mindful that there could be some tricky conditions on the roads, for example there will be strong winds that could affect transport, like high-sided vehicles crossing bridges, so there could be delays. While winds will ease off into breezy weather mid-morning, leaving sunshine and showers, gusts are due to pick up again by midday on Friday, with a warning from then covering most of the UK and remaining in place until Saturday evening.

But when they pulled over the truck, at the wheel was frail and doddery -year-old great grandfather Leo Sharp. And in the back they found  kilos of the drug. The decorated war veteran uttered three words: “Oh my God.” Sharp’s extraordinary transformation from a renowned plant grower to one of America’s most successful drug couriers has now been turned into a film, The Mule, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. In  alone, Sharp delivered more than a ton of cocaine – enough for . million people to each snort a line – making himself million.  But his criminal career came to an end when, on his th birthday, he was sentenced to three years in jail. Sharp’s lawyer, Darryl Goldberg, argued during the OAP’s trial that he was suffering from dementia and turned to crime over money worries. Mr Goldberg says: “I don’t think state troopers and highway patrolmen were suspicious of an elderly man driving cross-country. “He was an older man. He was entrepreneurial and adventurous and he was likely suffering from dementia and the hallmark of dementia is poor decision-making. “So when you put them all together it is a recipe for him making the very wrong decision in a moment of perceived financial weakness and perhaps that contributed into his desire to pursue something like this.” Sharp’s story started very shydferently, however. Chicago-based lawyer Mr Goldberg, recalls: “He was a Bronze Star recipient in World War Two, his time in the Army was a le story in itself.  “He fought in Italy at the famous battle at Monte Battaglia. If you read the description of the battle it is fascinating as bayonets and flame throwers were used in hand-to-hand combat. It is remarkable that people survived. His service sparked the travel bug in him and he was quite the world traveller.” After the war Sharp started a travel business and at one point even launched his own airline. But a passion for flowers brought him rock-star status among fans of daylilies – small trumpet-like flowers that come in an array of colours. On a farm in Michigan City, Indiana, he cultivated more than  dferent ieties and would attend conferences across the US dressed either all in black or white, where fans would queue to meet him. Neighbours recalled buses pulling up outside his -acre farm, packed with growers wanting to buy his plants. But the coming of the internet caused his customers to buy online where. With his business failing, it is believed one of his Mexican farmhands introduced Sharp to the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, headed by the ruthless Joaquin Guzman, known as El Chapo. The kingpin, currently on trial in New York, shipped an alleged  tons of cocaine. Yet elderly Sharp quickly emerged as the cartel’s most effective mule. In his beaten-up Lincoln truck he would transport  to  kilos of cocaine from the US-Mexico border and drive sedately up to Detroit.  Members of the cartel sneered at him behind his back for his advancing age and gave him the nickname El Tata – The Grandfather. He sometimes got confused when he tried to find the secret stash houses, so cartel members would be sent to meet him at motorway exits and guide him to warehouses. When he wanted to quit, they responded by putting a gun to his head and threatened his family. His lawyer Mr Goldberg enjoyed hearing the stories of his well-shytravelled client. He said: “He was a gentleman farmer, he did not live an extravagant le. “Despite the shycognitive decline he knew what he was getting into. “There came a point where he was less enthused about the process and that’s where they threatened him. He had a gun put to his head. He was the largest mule in Detroit and based on the numbers, he was monumentally substantial.” Drug Enforcement Agents in Detroit were astounded at the quantities of cocaine flooding the city, led by the legendary El Tata – a name constantly mentioned on the wiretapped phones of gang members. Special agent Jeff Moore, played by Bradley Cooper in the film, had spent a year trying to trace El Tata but to no avail. But thanks to the wiretaps, they knew the drug runner was making a delivery to Detroit in October . The truck was spotted near Kalamazoo and soon a host of unmarked police and DEA cars were trailing the mysterious mule. El Tata was driving erratically and at one point cut across traffic to leave the highway, sparking fears he knew he was being followed.  But he was just picking up French fries and a drink from a drive-through. At .pm a State Trooper, who was in on the operation, pulled him over for a routine traffic stop. Out of the truck stumbled a scruffy old man, cupping his ear so he could hear the officer’s commands. The trooper’s dashcam records the old man saying: “What’s going on, officer  At age , I want to know why I’m being stopped.” A drug-snfing dog was brought in and immediately drew attention to the back of the truck. When police said they were going to search, Sharp replied: “Why don’t you just kill me and let me just leave the planet.” In the back were five duffel bags containing  kilos of cocaine.

This is a national scandal staring at us in plain sight. The figures are damning: the number of people living in the streets has risen by % since the Conservatives came to power, more than  die sleeping rough each year, , households are homeless. But statistics never tell the full story. That is why the Mirror wanted to give voice to those who have fallen on hard times. Their stories are of people who have struggled with addiction, people with mental health problems and people with nowhere  to turn. They are scared, lonely and destitute. Many tell of how they have been assaulted, had their tents stolen and let down by the services supposed to support them. There are also stories of great kindness and compassion. The volunteers who get up at the crack of dawn to check on rough sleepers in their area, the charities which provide vital support and the health workers who have mended broken lives. Above all, we heard time and time again from people who never thought they would be in this position.  As one homeless person told us: “people are a tissue-thin slice away from disaster, they just don’t think about it.” In a country as rich as Britain this shouldn’t be the case. We are seeing the consequences of a government which stopped caring. The safety net which should be there has been torn to shreds. You could point to the Universal Credit or the shortage of accommodation or the lack of drug treatment services or the paucity of mental health provision. All are responsible for the rise in rough sleeping and all flow from the cuts imposed by this Tory government. What makes this so shameful is there is a better way. The Housing First strategy pursued in Scotland is transforming lives by giving people a secure home and support for addiction or mental health problems. If the Government is serious about tackling rough sleeping it should follow this approach. We have given those on the streets a voice. Now we need to give them hope.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off.

I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see.

I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united sign former st johnstone defender mark connolly","story":"Dundee United have signed defender Mark Connolly from Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee.Irish-born Connolly joins United on a contract until the end of season .As a youngster, he spent a season at St Johnstone and two seasons at Kilmarnock where he became club captain between two separate periods at Crawley Town.He has represented Ireland at Under , Under  and  level.The -year-old becomes Robbie Neilson#s ninth signing of the January window and third of a busy final day.

a hot chocolate and sleeping bag.“We contacted Dundee City Council’s homeless services and due to complications which we can’t ulge they were unable to offer immediate support.“We arranged for him to

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel. The three and a half storey building, which has lain empty for more than  years, consists of two commercial shop units on the ground floor and sandstone units above is located on Kyle Street. It had a guide price of pound,.

Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"piping hot performance ayr stars","story":"NewsPiping hot performance from Ayr starsAyr Pipe Band Society took to the stage to support the world-renowned bagpipe band Red Hot Chilli Pipers.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  FEB NewsAyr Pipe Band Society gear up to support Red Hot Chilli Pipers at Ayr Town Hall \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPiping stars joined together to wow crowds at a top show in Ayr’s Town Hall.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion.ldquoPeople have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

However, the advice from officers and consultants is that signicant questions remain about the deliverability of the current tram-train option, particularly in relation to capacity at Central Station.ldquoAs a result, the Executive Steering Group has agreed additional work should be done to establish an alternative Outline Business Case for a Personal Rapid Transitoption.ldquoThis work was not advanced by the previous City Deal Cabinet, but it is now crucial in order to allow us to make a fully-informed choice about which of the options in front of us should be progressed.:Glasgow Airport rail link saga has dragged on for far too longldquoI remain committed to a solution that delivers improved public transport connectivity to Glasgow Airport - but I am determined it should also provide value for money for the city, and deliver the widest possible inclusive economic benefits.ldquoIrsquom confident we have made signicant progress towards that outcome today.Glasgow Airport said congestion on the M means action is needed and ldquodoing nothing is not an option.Mark Johnston, managing director at Glasgow Airport, said: ldquoWe were informed that, due to issues around rail capacity, the project partners are developing an alternative option.: Half a million to go on addressing airport rail link fearsldquoThis will be evaluated and we will, of course, work with the partners to promote the delivery of an effective solution within the agreed timescale.It has been understood that transport officials were not keen on progressing the tram-train link from Glasgow Central to the airport.Michael Matheson, Transport Secretary, said: ldquoItrsquos crucial that improving access to Glasgow Airport is balanced with the needs of the regionrsquos existing transport network.ldquoThe Personal Rapid Transit system option potentially meets this aim, and I look forward to seeing the revised business case once itrsquos completed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-too-soon-to-make-informed-decision-on-independence","story":"The First Minister also said she had yet to make up her own mind about a fresh vote.In an interview on American TV, she said she would wait for a Brexit conclusion, and only then take a decision ldquobased on a calm consideration of whats in Scotlands best interests.:Nicola Sturgeon in US: Its clearer Scotlands national interests are not served by WestminsterHinting at a long process, she told PBS NewsHour that voters had a right to ldquoas much information as possible about an independent Scotlandrsquos relationship with the UK and EU.She did not want an ldquouninformed decision about a big change, as with Brexit.The cautious language will disappoint the gung-ho elements of the Yes movement, including some past and present SNP MPs, who have been agitating for a referendum this year.Ms Sturgeonhas been urged to capitaliseon the \"chaos\" at Westminster.Herpreference for\"calm consideration\"reflects the complications ofBrexit, which could change Scotlandrsquos options on the economy and the currency.Theresa May also continues to withhold referendum powers from Holyrood, making it unlikely that a referendum can be held before the next Holyrood election in .Ms Sturgeon is in the US and Canada this week to promote Scottish interests.In a speech to the Georgetown Institute on Monday, she repeated her commitment to give an update on the timing of another independence referendum in a ldquofew weeks.But in her PBS interview, the First Minister suggested this may not be the call to arms many of her supporters would like.She said the Brexit vote and the way Scotland had been ignored by London in the aftermath showed ldquocircumstances have changed materially since , the trigger set down in the SNP manesto of  for Holyrood having the right to call another referendum.She said: ldquoWhen the time is right for Scotland to look again at the question of independence, I think, would be the right thing to allow it to do.But asked when she thought the time would be right, she replied: ldquoWell, I think we have to allow the [Brexit] process that is currently underway to reach some conclusion.

Perhaps the film should be retitled lsquoAnyone but Celtic donrsquot win anything in Scotland.rsquoOh, and the idea Rangers are hard done by is laughable. Some of the nonsense which have come by way of the statements shames the club.Right, here goes. The referees in Scotland arenrsquot very good. They are not given enough help by their assistants, fourth official and the SFA. That they arenrsquot allowed to talk in public is a shambles and puts them under even more pressure.The only consistency in decisions made on the park and inside Hampden is that there is gross inconsistency.Every single club believes itrsquos them against everyone . Ask the supporters of Albion Rovers and they will have as many tales of awful officialdom from this season as any those mentioned above.But referees in Scotland are not cheats, which Boyd suggested. However, they need to improve, as do the three colleagues they have with them for Premiership games.If our game is crooked, we need to scrap it and start again.

However, Britains partition of Ireland, designed to keep the bulk of the Unionist population and heavy industry under the UK flag, sowed the seeds for future conflict in the north of Ireland.Our present vexatious issue with the Irish protocol has only arisen because the UKs decision to depart from the EU leaves Northern Ireland as, obviously, thanks to the partition of , the only part of the UK that shares a border with an EU country.The Irish Government and the EU are trying to work together with Theresa May and her Government to avoid future loss of le and conflict in Northern Ireland by ensuring that there is no hard border, now, and in the future.The only obstruction to Britain arriving at a solution at present appears to be from those who see the people on the island of Ireland as an irrelevance and a hindrance to a clean break with Brussels,despite  per cent of people in Northern Ireland voting to remain.Mr Gilmours exasperation displays an age-old condescending British attitude towards the Irish that I had hoped had evaporated into the mists of history.

pupils Tami Fadeyiand Ruairidh Cummingunveiled a ceremonial plaquePupils in the school’s choir sang two songs at the ceremony while a video documenting the construction project played alongside them.The £m project was completed last year and pupils have been at the school since August.During the building’s construction more than  pupils were taken by bus daily to nearby Midmill School for  months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them. In addition to the educational opportunities – working with artists, the community and the construction team – the pupils have also learned important lessons when it comes to being resilient and flexible.”Head Teacher Pamela Farquhar added: “As much as we loved our time at Kintore it is nice to be back home.“The new school was made possible thanks to Anne Gibson who sold her land to Aberdeenshire Council.“Her husband was a former head teacher here so the school has a special place in her heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kintore flats plans raise objections","story":"Councillors will next week debate proposals for  new affordable flats in the heart of Kintore which have attracted a host of objections.Langstane Housing Association has tabled plans for four property blocks featuring  one-bed flats and six two-bed flats on vacant waste ground on Forest Road.But  objections have been raised on the grounds of insufficient parking and road safety, increased traffic and congestion on Forest Road and the scale of the development and the adverse impact on the amenity.In a report to Aberdeenshire Council’s Garioch Area Committee which meets on Tuesday, director of infrastructure services Stephen Archer says that “on balance” while the development may have an amenity impact on the neighbouring properties, it will fall within acceptable standards.He says: “The proposal for  affordable flats would make a positive contribution to affordable housing provision in Kintore.“It is accepted that any development on this site will alter the outlook from neighbouring dwellings, however, the use of the site for a flatted development is considered compatible with the infill nature of the site and settlement location.”Councillors will be told that the pre-application consultations and discussions during the determination of the application to reduce the potential impact on the neighbouring properties has resulted in the final layout and design.But in its objection, Kintore Community Council slams the proposal, particularly in terms of inadequate parking spaces.Chair Fiona Cooper states: “The proposed parking for the development of  spaces for  residents is insufficient and would result in overspill parking on the oppositie side of the road which would obviously have a major affect on existing residents.”In terms of the scale of the development, the community council recommends a maximum of two-storeys, with Mrs Cooper adding: “The proposed development by reason of size is out of character and would have an unacceptably adverse impact on the amenities of the properties immediately opposite the site and the surrounding area by reason of overlooking and having a visually overbearing impact.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

It was windy that night too and a lot of people who fly drones have told me it wouldrsquove been too windy that night to fly one.Keith Banks, an amateur meteorologist who writes a monthly weather column for the John OrsquoGroat Journal, says mphgusts were blowing during the period the UFO was witnessed.ldquoIn my view the very blustery conditions would have effectively precluded a drone from flying, he said.Dedicated drone flyers agree, including Barry Scollay from Wick who says he has been flying the unmanned aerial vehicles for a decade.ldquoNo way a drone would have flown in those winds ndash thatrsquos a certain fact, said Mr Scollay, who has a Facebook page called Highland Aerial Views which has over , followersldquoIt would have to have been able to maintain its location in high winds.

Itrsquos just not as clear with the phone.The object disappeared not long after a police van appeared at around am.ldquoI couldnrsquot get to sleep and kept going to the window and the door to see it but it was gone, he says.Since posting the video online he has had numerous calls from self-professed ldquoUFO investigators.Therersquos been so many of them, he says hersquos now ldquovery waryof callers who ask ldquotoo many questions.ldquoItrsquos like being interviewed by the FBI, he said. ldquoVery weird and over the top with the secrecy.Since his sighting, an organisation called the British Earth and Aerial Mysteries Societyhas said it believes he saw an ldquointerdimensional plasma craft.The craft have also been suggested as a cause for recent disruptions at Gatwick and Heathrow airports.A spokesperson for Wick John OrsquoGroats Airport confirmed that it was closed during the period the object was sighted, and there are also no reports of the emergency services operating in the air at that time.Charliersquos video can be seen at https:youtu.be xdHBiqtkWhat do you think he saw  Email d.scott@nosnwith your suggestions.Thursday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Flexibility plea on new GP deal","story":"THE problems facing GPs in Caithness have been outlined to Scotlandrsquos health secretary Jeane Freeman by two north MSPs.Rhoda Grant and David Stewart.Labour representatives for the Highlands and Islands, met with Ms Freeman to express their concern about the new GP contract and the impact it could have on rural and remote areas.They were accompanied by Phil Wilson, a professor of primary care and rural health at the University of Aberdeen and a GP in Inverness.Also present was a Dingwall GP Miles Mack.Mrs Grant asked Ms Freeman for the face-to-face meeting at the Scottish Parliament and highlighted issues which GPs across the Highlands and Islands have raised with her and Mr Stewart.The doctors told the minister that five of the  permanent GPs in Caithness are likely to retire in the next five years.Ms Freeman heard that since  almost half of all permanent GP posts in the county have been vacant and partially replaced with short-term locum provision.Three practices have ceased to be independent contractors and have been taken over by NHS Highland.Concerns were also raised about the capacity for undergraduate teaching and the effect on retention and recruitment of GPs in remote areas.Doctors have told the MSPs that the new contract fails to recognise the workload in rural areas where surgeries deal with a far greater range of medical problems, including emergencies that would be dealt with in hospitals in urban areas.Mrs Grant said: ldquoThe main concern is that whatrsquos on the table with the new contract is an urban model and this just doesnrsquot suit remote and rural areas.ldquoGPs are worried it will cause poor continuity of care for patients and that procedures currently performed at surgeries are being centralised ndash for instance for blood tests or vaccinations.ldquoThis will inevitably inconvenience patients and worsen health outcomes by raising barriers to care.ldquoThe contract states that other healthcare professionals will be employed to deal with these extra tasks ndash but with rural GP posts remaining unfilled, and shortages of nurses in many areas, how can we expect to find these extra people in our out-of-the-way places ldquoThere must be flexibility for GPs to retain the old system of care.The new contractrsquos funding formula has been based on the number of appointmentsand does not take account of the issues faced by rural areas such as patient and doctor travel.ldquoGPs in our region cannot wait for another three years to see some movement on this and Irsquom hopeful that the health secretary will find a suitable way forward.At the meeting Ms Freeman said she had ldquogenuinely taken the issues seriously and discussion would continue with colleagues.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities. That may be the one silver lining to emerge from the Brexit process, whether there are any more remains to be seen.Stuart Murdoch is a solicitor advocate and partner at Burness Paull LLP©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4868785.1549464609!/image/image.jpg","title":"mike russell scotland facing deep recession under no deal brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A No deal Brexit could plunge Scotlands economy into a \"deep recession\" with widespread job losses and firms leaving the country, Brexit Secretary Mike Russell has warned.Scots could also face food price hikes of -% with rural areas of the country facing particular issues, he told MSPs at Holyrood.The cabinet Secretary spoke out as the likelihood of a No deal scenario looks increasingly likely, with Prime Minister Theresa May struggling to salvage her much-maligned Withdrawal Deal after its Commons rejection.Read more: Donald Tusk: ‘A special place in hell’ exists for Brexit backersThe Scottish Government has been \"steadily intensying\" its preparations for a No deal in the early months of the year, Mr Russell revealed today.He warned: \"A No-Deal Brexit has the potential to generate a signicant economic shock which could tip the Scottish economy into recession - potentially into a deep recession.\"It would also have a severe impact on the labour market resulting in potential job losses, business relocations and closures, underemployment and a reduction in recruitment.\"He even called for extra cash reserves be to pumped into the banking system, with small business likely to be worst hit.Read more: How to prepare your business in case of a no deal BrexitA special Scottish Government Resilience Committee, headed up by Deputy First Minister John Swinney has been established, with councils chiefs and Police Scotland involved.Fears of freight delays at Dover and through the channel tunnel could hit goods coming to Scotland, with rural areas worst hit.Mr Russell added: \"Transport Scotland is also working with transport providers and ports and airports in Scotland to assess their existing capacity and identy how they could help mitigate disruption and ensure that Scotland’s exporters can continue to get their goods to market.\"The absence of a trade agreement between the UK and the EU would result in World Trade Organisationtarfs for imports and exports is also expected to seesignicant price increases, MSPs heard, particularly for food and drink. \"The Governor of the Bank of England has identied potential rises of between -%,\" Mr Russell added.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J.

On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"mcdaid double ends stars cup hopes","story":"Irish Cup Sixth RoundLarne Crumlin Star A SECOND half brace from David McDaid crushed Crumlin Star#s dreams of a place in the last eight of the Irish Cup as runaway Championship One leaders, Larne fought back from a goal down to claim the win at a sunny and cold Inver Park on Saturday.The Ardoyne side dared to dream when Joe McNeill put them into the lead on  minutes, but the hosts drew level on  thanks to a Jeff Hughes header and after the break, they went ahead when McDaid converted what looked a harshly awarded penalty after Hughes# shot hit the arm of Ciaran Hughes and the ex-Cltonville striker make sure of victory with a late goal.Star were far from disgraced in this game and their large support could be proud of their team#s efforts on the day as they put it up to the Premiership-bound opposition who were laden with players who have played at the top level including former Reds in McDaid, Martin Donnelly, Tomás Cosgrove and Conor Devlin.In front of a big crowd that added to the occasion, the visitors opened with confidence and two minutes in, Devlin had to get down to his right to claw Barry McKervey#s free-kick around the post for a corner that led to a shot from Mark Lyons flying wide right.Larne gradually got to grips with the early pressure and looked to move the ball quickly in order to find gaps in the Star defence.Their first chance fell to McDaid who didn#t get hold of his shot and it was easily saved by Shane Harrison.On nine minutes, Martin Donnelly weaved his way past a number of challenges from the right and found himself just yards out, but he elected to place his shot rather than put power behind it with the goal at his mercy and Harrison was able to get down to stop it and get his behind for a corner that was aimed at the back post, but McDaid headed just too high.Star remained a threat and were always looking to create an opening # something they did to perfection on  minutes when brothers, Aidan and Joe McNeill combined to perfection with Aidan playing a perfectly-weighted ball in behind the Larne defence with Joe beating Devlin to the ball and lted it over the goalkeeper and into the net to send the away support into raptures.The pressure was now on Larne and they bombarded Star in search for the equaliser.Patrick McNally # a replacement for the injured Shane McEleney # headed over from Tomás Cosgrove#s shot and Cosgrove then saw his shot at the near post saved.The hosts were getting closer and on  minutes, the goal came when Hughes rose to meet Donnelly#s corner from the right and thundered a header high into the net.The momentum was with Larne and Donnelly then saw his brilliant free-kick saved onto the post and cleared by Harrison, while on the stroke of half-time, Cosgrove#s curling effort from the edge of the box went just outside the post with the goalkeeper beaten.With the sides level at the break, it was all to play for and both tried to establish themselves early in the second period.Chances were thin on the ground with Larne#s Jeff Hughes hooking a th minute effort well off target, but they really should have gone ahead on  minutes when Cosgrove cut in on the left and rolled a good ball across the face of goal to McNally a couple of yards from goal, but he inexplicably lted the ball over when it looked much easier to score.Larne did get their noses in front on  minutes from McDaid#s penalty, but Star certainly felt the award was hard as Hughes# shot at goal seemed to just hit the arm of Burns who had no time to get out of the way, but a spot-kick was the decision of referee Shane Andrews and McDaid made no mistake, firing high into the net.Star now needed a goal, but they were unable to carve out any clear chances with Larne looking to put the game away and Martin Donnelly had a couple of chances, but couldn#t find the goal his performance deserved.Instead, it was left to McDaid who swept home in the final minute from Lee Lynch#s cross from the right to seal his side#s passage into the quarter-final.LARNE: C Devlin, C Ramsey, T Cosgrove, J Hughes, L Lynch, S McEleney , F Sule, G Kelly, B Tiney , M Donnelly , D McDaid.

Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

The Prime Ministers official spokesman told reporters in Westminster: \"The conditions for a border poll are set out in the Belfast Agreement. It remains the Northern Ireland Secretarys view that the majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support the current political settlement and that the circumstances requiring a border poll are not satisfied.\"Ms McDonald said Theresa May did not commit to saying in what circumstances an Irish unity poll might be called. The  Belfast Agreement states that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call such a referendumat any time it appears likely that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland would wish to leave the United Kingdom and enter into a united Ireland. The exchange between the Prime Minister and Sinn Fein leader came during a series of meetings with political parties at Stormont House in Belfast. Ms McDonald said that a majority here voted for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, and that by the region being taken out of the EU with the rest of the UK, the principle of consent - a key principle of the Belfast Agreement - has been damaged. \"Nobody in Ireland has consented to Brexit, the people of the north of Ireland voted to remain,\" she said. \"The Good Friday Agreement, the central premise of it as regards to constitutional arrangements, is the concept of consent. We believe that in attempting to coerce the north of Ireland out of the European Union against the democratically expressed wishes of the people, that the concept of consent has been damaged. \"We also know from polling data north and south that public sentiment is of a view that in the event of a crash Brexit, that peoples preference would be for Irish unity. \"The only way that anyone can act in a democratic fashion is to respect consent, to respect the democratic wishes of the people of the north of Ireland and to use the Good Friday Agreement, its provisions, to guide us in the time ahead. \"Sothere is a Tory crash, and Mrs May has conceded as much on the floor of the House of Commons, in that event, not alone will there be pressure for a referendum on Irish unity, there will be absolute democratic imperative to call such a referendum.\"When pressed over how Mrs May had responded to this during their meeting, Ms McDonald said that neither the Prime Minister or Secretary of State Karen Bradley committed to saying when oran Irish unity poll would be called. She said: \"But that is the secondary consideration, the primary issue here is the concept of consent which is hardwired into the Good Friday Agreement, the fact that the people of the north of Ireland have not consented to Brexit, the fact that business, farmers, academia, community sector, trade unions and political system almost unanimously regard Brexit as damaging and negative, almost unanimously regard the backstop as the absolutely bare minimum and the bottom line. \"The exception to that consensus is the DUP. The DUP cannot rule the roost on these matters, actually the people need to be in the driving seat, just as they voted against Brexit. In the event of a crash, I think the democratically correct thing to do, the compliant thing to do as regards the Good Friday Agreement, is toto the people again, and in a structured way, to allow for the debate for the conversation for the transition and to put the question on Irish unity. \"Mrs May is a unionist, she takes a dferent view.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unionists vote down bid to celebrate pride 2019 with town","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"uup tackles bradley and pm may over legacy issues","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If minds are focused, then we can reach a deal.\"She said that she had delivered a \"simple and straightforward message\" to the Prime Minister to \"stand strong in Brussels\" and remain faithful to her parliamentary promise to seek legally binding changes to the backstop.\"We want to get a deal which works for the entire UK but also importantly one that works for our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland, too,\" she said.\"But people need to be realistic. There can only be an agreementit can command the necessary support in Parliament.\"The backstop is the core of the problem. \"The Prime Minister must press for it to be dealt with. \"Rather than cast insults, now is the time to concentrate on genuine diplomacy and solutions.\"She hit out at those \"scaremongering about a hard border, checkpoints, barbed wire and violence\" and claimed they were being \"deliberately misleading\".Mrs Foster said people expected their political leaders \"whether in London, Dublin or Brussels to be focused on getting a deal rather than playing political games\".But as the Prime Minister prepares to fly to Brussels, Mrs ONeill said: \"Theresa May has an opportunity to bring an end to the chaos and the uncertainty.\"To do achieve that, it isnt the backstop that she needs to ditch, it is the DUP.\"Also writing in todays Belfast , the Sinn Fein vice-president rounded on her partys former partner at Stormont.\"Weve had two years of a British Government pandering to the DUP and look where that has got us,\" she said.\"The DUP are wreckers like their friends in the ERG . The government here collapsed because of the DUP and they have now brought their dysality and chaos into the heart of the Brexit process.\"Mrs ONeill claimed that the DUP wasnt interested in a sensible Brexit deal \"just as they arent interested in the rights of citizens here or in restoring power-sharing unless it is on their terms\". She insisted that a border poll must be held in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Speaking yesterday after meeting the Prime Minister, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald accused Mrs May of coming to Belfast with \"no plan, no credibility and no honour\". She said: \"We have told her that the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong.\"We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland or Irish people... are over and will not .\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs May hadnt filled him with confidence about her ability to broker a deal that included the backstop.\"These are extremely serious times. People can be in no doubt that we are heading towards a hard borderthe backstop is not banked prior to March  a retrograde step that will devastate our economy and our hard-won peace,\" he said.\"We made it very clear to Theresa May that Northern Ireland must stay in the single market and the customs unionour interests are to be protected. Westminster must heed that. \"UUP leader Robin Swann said the Prime Minister must introduce direct rule herethere is a no-deal Brexit. \"She has to put direct rule in place come March  because Northern Ireland needs political leadership and it needs political direction,\" he said. Mr Swann claimed Mrs May appeared reluctant to talk about efforts to restore power-sharing. \"The conversation we were having with the Prime Minister was initially about Brexit, we had to drag her to a place where we actually started to talk about how we get these institutions back up and running,\" he said. The UUP leader said Karen Bradley should move to begin talks to restore devolution. \"If some parties do not want to participate, thats up to them. They will be self-excluding. It was done at the time of the Belfast Agreement negotiations, so there is no reason why it cant be done now,\" he added.Speaking after meeting the Prime Minister, Alliance leader Naomi Long said the time for repeating red lines was gone.\"What we need now, and the only lines we are interested in, are black and white on paper, an actual deal,\" she said.\"That is the only thing that is actually going to reassure the public it is the only thing that is going to reassure business.\""},{"url":null,"title":"11 funny examples of movie logic social media users wish worked in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out.

I think he’d be wasting quite a lot of someone ’s money.”New Presbyterian moderator calls for ‘common sense’ over Irish language act Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

Two fields at Silverwood Farm near Oxford Island have been selected for planting a mixture of arable crops, to be used as wild bird seed.For more information about Portadown Men’s Shed check out their Facebook page or contact Alan McDowell on   . and some of his party colleagues pictured entering Stormont House to meet with the Prime Minister.

I wanted to do something which would allow me to combine the flexibility of family with work and give me a good balance. I also wanted to develop and use my skill sets.”From her initial idea, Eveva was born – setting her up as a virtual assistant. “I saw a niche in the market for this type of work with small businesses and self- employed people who simply do not have the time to manage the tasks themselves,” she explained.“I offer a range of services, particularly in digital marketing, where I manage email marketing campaigns and social media pages for clients. I joined a few local networking groups, where I have since met my first clients and I am now starting to see referrals come through.” she explains.Eve turned her vision into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme, which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. “Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality. “Workspace Enterprises helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan,” said Eve.Brexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy Wilson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

But also we recognise that it has been politicised in many ways, and we think that discussion needs to be depoliticised for the benefit and the good of the whole of our land.“I think we need to be sensitive, particularlygetting an Irish language act was too costly and bureaucratic and we need to measure that against hospital beds and all those aspects. So from that point of view, I think we need a little bit of common sense in the discussion.”He went on to add: “I think we just need to be careful within the breadth of what that encompasses.“Certainly we’ve to value the Irish language in a way that those who do think it’s important [are able to] recognise that and can see that.“But I think there have to be constraints and there has to be a bit of common sense in just how much it actually costs, and that I suppose is the other angle other people come at it from.”Brexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy Wilson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

This is about people being able to do their jobs, it’s about workforce planning in our health service, in our schools, it’s about all of those things. It’s not about philosophical debates in Parliament.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who was third in to see Mrs May, said she needed to understand there was “no alternative” to the backstop.“The bottom line is this – for the people of Northern Ireland, for our peace process, for all of our political progress, we need to remain within the customs union and single market in order to avoid a hard border,” he said.‘Hell is too good for them,’ NI academic says of no-deal BrexiteersDamages case could open door to hundreds of secondary Troubles victim claims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I think that will begin to be understood at all levels in the British parliament because they don’t have an alternative. They talk about vague alternatives but there aren’t any alternatives.”Following her discussions with the PM, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald accused Mrs May of coming to Belfast with “no plan, no credibility and no honour”.She added: “We regard the position adopted by Mrs May and her government as one of hostility to Irish interests, we have told her that Irish public and political opinion is united on the matter of protecting Ireland north and south, and we have told her that certainly we will not blink.”Mrs May’s partners in government, the DUP, were the final party to meet the PM at Stormont House.Speaking afterwards, DUP leader Arlene Foster reiterated her position that the backstop is the “main problem”.She said her party has an “ongoing engagement” with the government over Brexit.“This was another useful opportunity to press for a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom. We want a deal which respects the Union and the referendum result,” she said.“Our message was very simple. The draft Withdrawal Agreement is flawed because the backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. “The backstop is the main problem. It must be dealt with in the terms set out in the Brady Amendment which secured a majority in the House of Commons.“During that debate, the prime minister made commitments that there would be legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. That is what is needed.“It is welcome that the prime minister is travelling to Brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School.

He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Wednesday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
