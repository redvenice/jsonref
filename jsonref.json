[{"url":null,"title":"What need know Mail Forces Computers Kids","story":"Share this article England rubgy star Maro Itoje also speaks out in the Mail today about the need to help poorer children who are falling victim to a growing digital ide in lockdown.Mr Williamson said: ‘We know how difficult this past year has been for young people who have had their education disrupted by the pandemic, which is why we have provided laptops and tablets at such speed and scale to those who need them the most.‘The Daily Mail’s support in building on the aid provided by the Government can only be a good thing and I welcome the undoubted generous response of Mail readers, ensuring even more young people can benefit from a device for both home education and into the future.’Mail Force will help companies recycle old computers for school use – and is set to help fund new laptops and tablets – so the Mail is asking its famously generous readers to contribute whatever they can towards the costs.Around £15 could pay to refurbish a laptop for a child in danger of missing vital weeks of education.Itoje – tipped as a future captain of his country – has been leading a personal campaign to tackle the digital ide.He told the Mail: ‘We must strive for every child to have an equal education because it is the one gift that stays with them for life and opens up their world.’Unlike the first lockdown, schools are now mandated to provide three to five hours of lessons per pupil every day – yet lots of youngsters cannot get online.Ofcom estimated last year that there were 1.78million children in the UK without access to a device for online learning.Since then, the Government has ordered 1.3million laptops for pupils in England alone. So far, 800,000 have been delivered.Mail Force aims to speed things up. It is set to help fund new kit and has also identified a rich alternative source of laptops for schools – firms upgrading their equipment who want to donate 50 or more of their old machines. The charity’s expert partner, IT specialists Computacenter, will collect them, securely wipe them and install software to make them home-school ready.Last night, former education secretary Lord Blunkett warned of a ‘new kind of educational apartheid’ created by the digital ide, and said: ‘Quite simply, our children need laptops if they are to learn.  That is why I’m backing the Mail’s campaign to get the equipment, connectivity and conditions right for youngsters to have everything they need – computers, software and support – to be able to learn at home and begin catching up in the months and years ahead.’Anna Webb, executive head of Newbridge Junior School and Penhale Infant School in Portsmouth, said: ‘This is a brilliant campaign and will make a huge difference to us.‘We got 116 laptops from the DfE which was great but we have over 600 pupils across our two schools and around 50 per cent are still trying to access lessons from a mobile phone.’Last year, Mail Force donated an incredible 42million items of PPE to the NHS, care homes and charity sector frontlines.The campaign won a public service award and the Mail was hailed for holding the Government to account at the same time as helping to solve the problem. "},{"url":null,"title":"Almost half people areas high ethnic minority populations refusing jab","story":"Share this articleAlmost half of people in high ethnic minority areas snub coronavirus jab | News | The TimesCovid: Fake news \u0027causing UK South Asians to reject jab\u0027 - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrews Pitch Palace enterprise paused","story":"Share this article As director, Eliasch will replace Amanda Thirsk, who stepped down as Andrew\u0027s private secretary in January after more than 15 years.

Stallard and her colleague decided it needed to be shut down, and they were the ones to do it.“The conclusion we came to was that we had to send out a blanket message to every student, saying: these are the things you’re saying that are wrong these are the things you’re saying that you don’t mean to be offensive, but are still wrong, that are offending LGBTQ people around you. And we can prove that because we are gay, and we are offended. That was the real crux of the message the hammer on the nail of the whole thing was us saying that we were gay.”During the assemblies, they explained what LGBTQ means and drew attention to statistics around depression, self-harm and suicide rates in young LGBTQ people.Despite Stallard’s nerves, the risk paid off there was nothing but positive feedback from students and fellow teachers, and she didn’t hear anything from parents, which she took as a good sign. Her story was picked up by Good Morning Britain and she was subsequently asked to write a chapter for a book on LGBTQ leadership in teaching.Being a role model for LGBTQ students (or LGBTU – “u” for unsure) is hugely important to the languages teacher. “I always refer to it as the best part of my job that I don’t get paid for,” she says. “Obviously ‘the rest’ often has to come first, but being a role model and helping others gives me emotional, warm fuzzies.”And what is “the rest”? Well Stallard not only teaches Spanish and French, but also heads up the languages department and is the school’s professional tutor, charged with managing all the trainee teachers.When Stallard was a teenager, section 28 was still in place – it was a law that prevented councils and schools from “promoting the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”. She remembers a teacher at her school who was gay, but not openly. “We knew he was gay, but there was no way that he was allowed to say anything supportive or give us references or materials to help us figure ourselves out because it was illegal. And so, for me it’s a gift to be the person I needed when I was 13, 14, 15 years old. It’s pretty cool. Even if I do have to have a few tough moments.”The exuberance that Stallard has for helping young LGBTU people find their place at school and in the wider world is invigorating. You might even say she’s not only teaching French and Spanish, but a third language – one with roots in love, acceptance and self-pride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2750b689e2c77cce7176947f55ffdd32b9dc1e3/0_157_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dee2a7ea6d6c6d5bf3d92c24cd3f30ef","title":"seven ways being a fifa pro gamer makes me a better teacher yes really","story":"Secondary school maths teacher by day, Fifa pro gamer by night – Sheikh Iqbal explains why it’s a perfect combinationSheikh Iqbal started teaching secondary school maths in 2015, having been inspired to move into the classroom by his work with vulnerable young people at a youth centre in his home town of Blackburn.After taking up gaming in 2018 as a way to wind down, Iqbal quickly found that he had a knack for playing Fifa, and picked up a contract as a pro gamer for his beloved Burnley FC – competing in Fifa ePremier League tournaments and manning the matchday game zone at Burnley’s Turf Moor stadium.The most surprising part of the story? The fact that teaching maths at Tauheedul Islam boys’ high school, in Blackburn, and being a pro gamer not only work in tandem, but actually complement each other. Iqbal, 27, explains more ...1 Fifa is a brilliant way to bring maths to life in the classroomIntroducing topics such as taxes might feel like alien concepts to teenagers who’ve never had a wage slip, but teaching through the lens of Fifa makes the topics more relatable and digestible to them.Using something familiar to hook them in makes pupils much more likely to listen to the rest of the lesson and readily ask and answer questions when they might otherwise stay quiet.2 Focus and planning are key skills – for me and my students As Burnley’s eSports PlayStation captain, my contract requires me to play 30 weekend league games each week, which means I have to use my time wisely – allocating windows for marking, lesson planning and Fifa. I’ve learned to concentrate and work efficiently. These are skills I’ve been able to pass on to my pupils when they’re preparing for exams, I encourage them to plan wisely and focus, so no time is wasted.3 Playing Fifa makes me relatable to my students, because they do it too I’m known for being strict in the classroom – we only talk console games if it’s part of my lesson – but in the corridors, I’ll often have four or five students crowded round asking for tips to improve their game, which is really nice. Sometimes students forget that their teachers have lives outside school, so playing Fifa helps them see me as a real person. Building that rapport makes it easier for them to open up about other stuff too, whereas it might have felt daunting to speak to their maths teacher without the extra connection.4 Pursuing my goals encourages my pupils to follow their own passionsWho doesn’t want to sign for their favourite football club? When I started playing Fifa in 2018, it was a way to relax. Now I get to go inside all the parts of Turf Moor, something I’d dreamed of as a fan, and even meet players … although I did have to turn down an event with first team goalie Nick Pope, because it clashed with parents’ evening. I think it’s pretty cool that my students have seen me achieve ambitions of my own outside the classroom, and I know it’s encouraged them to pursue their dreams too.5 I’ve learned it’s all about balance, and that’s a lesson I’m keen to pass onWhen I was growing up, at exam time, my family would take the games console away from me but I tell my students that it’s OK to use gaming as a way to wind down, that it’s all about finding a productive balance. Wellbeing is a big focus, and I encourage pupils to find something they enjoy, like gaming, to break up revision. It can actually be a far better formula for passing exams and not becoming stressed out.6 Pro gaming has taught me patience – and that’s something I need loads of in the classroom One of the things I love most about teaching is the interaction with students, but it doesn’t mean it’s always easy. When I was younger, I might have become easily frustrated or angry on the PlayStation, but playing competitively, as an adult, has taught me how to keep a cool head, which comes in pretty handy when you’re managing a class of teenagers.7 I can show them how maths applies to everyday lifeOne of the first questions kids often ask in maths is: “When am I going to use this in real life?” A lot of the skills I use in gaming – problem-solving, breaking down something into a step-by-step process – are ones I teach my students through mathematics too. Training your brain to think in a systematic way is as useful in trigonometry as it is in strategy-busting computer games and the day-to-day stuff we face as adults. I knew that through teaching I could make a difference to kids’ lives, but the impact of getting them engaged with maths is beyond measure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3cd293d694b5cd661df345b4f645b9a6083f7c2/0_0_2307_1384/master/2307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab216e7da2832c0c5e69e6feedf9aae9","title":"turtles dont do maths teachers recount their funniest classroom moments","story":"With so many characters in every classroom, even the most routine of days can give rise to truly memorable exchanges. Here, teachers recall some of their most uplifting momentsTeaching is about so much more than imparting knowledge and a love of learning. For many who find themselves in front of a class, what turns their profession into a passion are the quirky and funny moments – and their pupils’ reactions – when things don’t quite go to plan.Staff will tell you that seeing children through their educational journey is a life-affirming privilege, and that there are more memorable, uplifting (and sometimes hilarious) moments than they can count. For this piece, they recall a few of them …Bruno Roth, 34, is a primary and early years teacher at Millfields community school and children’s centre in Hackney, east LondonRoth is from a family of teachers, though before training he spent time as a musician touring with a band in his native Spain before moving to the UK.His love of rock music remains and features heavily in many of his lessons. He plays songs to help pupils burn off steam at the start of class while opting for calmer tunes to encourage quiet reflection or calming meditation. He loves bringing laughter to his classroom with approaches such as a “SATs TV show” or by using Willy Wonka-style golden tickets to reward good performance.Key to delivering this is something Roth, and other great teachers, have in abundance: the ability to laugh at themselves.In fact one of his funniest memories was prompted by an error on his part.“I was doing an online lesson for a nursery class that I’d only had for two weeks, so I really didn’t know the children that well. It was the end of the term, so we were talking about holidays. I asked what their plans were and if they were excited, and plenty of hands went up.“This really nice boy said he was excited because he was going on holiday to Poundland. I made a big deal out of it as I wanted him to feel special, so I went on and on about how exciting Poundland was and how many unexpected items you can find there.“After speaking excessively about the wonders of Poundland, his mum interrupted and said: ‘Poland! Poland! We are going to Poland!’Shobha Pillai, 44, is a primary teacher at the Park Federation academy trust, in Hayes, west LondonAs a child, Pillai liked school so much that at home she used to make her younger brother play pretend classrooms. It’s fair to say that she was probably destined to become a teacher.Now, with a specialism in maths, Pillai uses her extensive knowledge to upskill colleagues and to plan classes for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) – and it is from one of these that she has a particularly treasured memory.She says: “I was with my SEN group doing area and perimeter. We use a scheme called white rose, which includes a turtle called Tiny.”Tiny is a teaching aid who suggests answers, and it is up to the pupils to decide if he is right.After one question, Pillai asked her class: “Well, can Tiny be right?”“One of my students, who actually finds maths quite tricky, put his hand up to point out that the width was missing so you couldn’t work out the area. That in itself was wonderful because a few weeks earlier that child didn’t know what area was.”But before coming up with his reply, he wanted to make a point: “Well, first of all Miss, I don’t think turtles do maths,” he said.Sam Jones, 37, is head of drama at Hele’s school in PlymouthJones didn’t have a traditional route into teaching. Nobody in his family had graduated from university so, after struggling with his own exams, he decided that continuing with formal education wasn’t realistic.Although he always felt drama was one subject he was good at, he initially dismissed pursuing his passion for performance as mere fantasy.Instead, he followed both his father and brother in picking up a trade, and started working as a scaffolder.Jones was helping to build a supermarket when he was handed a further education prospectus that ultimately led him into teaching, completely changing his life.He enrolled on a performance and live art degree at Nottingham Trent University and later worked on the “Aim Higher” scheme, which looks to provide opportunities for pupils from underprivileged backgrounds.Teaching has provided Jones with a career of highs. He has taken 44 pupils to perform at Notre Dame, in Paris, and, in 2019, was a Silver winner, one of just 11 nationally, in the Pearson Secondary School Teacher of the Year award.But one of his most treasured moments came thanks to a pupil with a penchant for melodrama.The boy had spent the morning ploughing fields and had decided to drive the tractor in for show time. Well, it’s one way to make an entrance.Rachael Procter Lane, 38, is a secondary teacher at Bradley Stoke community school, in BristolBy day she teaches English language and literature and by night she is a comedy improviser.Procter Lane has always adored teaching and has managed to strike a balance between her work in education and her comedy career.She says: “I think that’s because both use such transferable skills. For each student, you have to be who they need you to be in that moment. That may be the best friend or the worst enemy – whoever I need to be to move that child along.“Keeping 30 teenagers engaged in your lesson means you have to be entertaining. If you are a teacher, you are a performer. Though you don’t often get a round of applause at the end.”Her approach of wedding education and performance has proved a real asset in the classroom. Procter Lane recalls a recent lesson on grammar in which she was beginning to lose the attention of her year 9 class.Procter Lane said: “They needed to learn the list ‘For-And-Nor-But-Or-Yet-So’ to use in compound sentences. But they started to look like they were falling asleep at their desks.”Thinking on her feet thanks to her improv skills, Procter Lane came up with a plan. She laughs: “I got the class to stand up, march round the room and chant the list to the army drill song ‘I don’t know but I’ve been told’.”Procter Lane’s attention-commanding approach was a hit. The teens threw themselves into the chant with such enthusiasm that it even instigated something of a tradition when entering the English class.In the coming days, if Procter Lane crossed their path in school corridors, the pupils would burst into the chant – and laughter – as a greeting to their English teacher.Michelle Smith, 41, is a modern foreign languages teacher at St George’s Church of England school in Gravesend, Kent, who it happens is also an adventurerSmith loves to surprise pupils with tales of her mountaineering, extreme events and adventures visiting places such as Mount Kilimanjaro because pupils often forget that teachers have lives beyond the classroom. She believes that sharing her experiences and achievements can help motivate them in and out of school.She says that sometimes the funniest moments occur when a meticulously thought-out lesson plan doesn’t quite work out as intended.She says: “Sometimes, when you take over a class it can be quite tricky. One particular instance was with a year 10 class who were not answering my questions about the previous learning.“The class was quite flat that day, so I decided to lay on the floor and told them I was going to sleep.“Instantly, one of the class said: ‘Miss, are you OK? The answer is …,’ and then proceeded to come out with the perfect answer to one of my questions.“The thing I have learned is to laugh at myself when things don’t go to plan and to encourage resilience.“After all, we are key role models for all those sitting in front of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3370880ebbc51dc51ac745efe421254d4f977656/0_0_5616_3744/master/5616.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c37f74705a21a134b01a82512b1c549b 660w","title":"garden leaves as embroidered artworks in pictures","story":"American artist Hillary Waters Fayle creates intricately patterned artworks by delicately stitching colourful threads into leaves. “I want this work to ask people to slow down and think about this leaf – what beauty can be achieved when working with care.” She collects the leaves from her yard or from parks and maps out the design on each one before stitching.

Having now filed his report, I hope he’s booked himself a luxury chauffeur to whisk him home. Congratulations to Manchester City, who advance to a fifth-round tie at Swansea having refused to panic when in a very sticky situation. Commiserations to Cheltenham Town, who were nine minutes away from one of the greatest upsets of all time. Thanks for reading this MBM. Stay safe and warm, everyone. Nighty night!Michael Duff is in a philosophical mood. “I don’t know whether it’s tough to take. I’m so proud of the players. I said before the game I wanted to effect the game in a positive way, and I don’t think we deserved the third. That was harsh on the lads. But that’s what they do, they’re world-class players, they move you and move and move, but I’m incredibly proud. The players they brought off the bench probably tells you something. The way they celebrated their goals probably tells you something as well. They’ll know they’ve been in a game. They did everything I asked, other than see the game out, but they’ve done that to better teams than us! Unfortunately it wasn’t to be. But I’m delighted for the club. The key is enjoy it, but we’re back to work against Oldham on Monday. We’ve got to kick on.”The City cream rose to the top in the end. Foden and the substitute Cancelo proved the difference in the end, the latter with a hand in two of the goals that broke Cheltenham hearts. But when the pain subsides, the League Two team will have memories to last a lifetime. Tozer and May were the stand-out heroes, but Azaz, Boyle, Clements and Raglan weren’t too far behind. Oh, and Griffiths in goal. And Lloyd, Blair, Freestone, Thomas, Williams, Long and Addai. What a performance, the Robins nine minutes away from one of the biggest shocks in the entire history of the FA Cup. City will feel extremely relieved to have escaped, just in time. They’ll travel to Swansea City in the fifth round.Phil Foden was City’s stand-out performer, and here he is, talking to the BBC. “We were a bit slow at times in the first half, but it was all down to them, they played really well and made it hard for us. They had a good shape. We’re really glad to get the win. In the end we got the goals. There’s no better feeling than scoring, I’m just enjoying it at the moment.” He also reports that after the final whistle, he told Cheltenham striker Alfie May that he’s “a great player, their most influential player ... I said you had a great game and your team done well today.” The young man very magnanimous in victory.City clear one hell of a hurdle at Cheltenham. This score flatters them. It’s not that they were poor they weren’t. It’s just that Cheltenham were magnificent to a man, is all.City ping it around. Suddenly they turn up the tempo. Cancelo sashays infield from the right and plays Gundogan in down the channel. Gundogan fizzes towards the near post, where Torres slams home.90 min +2: City continue to play keep ball in the professional style. They’re showing the League Two side ultimate respect. Cheltenham have earned every scrap.90 min +1: On the BBC, Danny Murphy has named Ben Tozer the man of the match. Nobody would disagree. He’s been a giant at both ends of the pitch. That goalline clearance from Mendy: man!90 min: There will be four extra minutes in which Cheltenham can salvage their dream.89 min: City play keep ball. All of a sudden, the clock is their friend.87 min: They nearly damn well did, you know. Laporte half clears the corner. The ball drops to Blair, just inside the box to the right of goal. He attempts a Le Tissieresque volley towards the top left, but it’s always flying far too high.86 min: Another long Tozer throw earns a corner. They couldn’t, could they?Fernandinho, out on the left, floats a diagonal ball into the box. Jesus - just about level - brings it down delicately before battering a shot into the bottom right. A brilliant double whammy from City. How quickly a dream can evaporate. 83 min: Another opportunity for Tozer to fling in a long throw. Before he can take it, Guardiola comes across to complain about something or other, presumably Tozer’s elaborate towelling routine. Eventually the throw comes in. Mahrez deals with this one. Cancelo crosses deep from the right. Foden springs the Cheltenham offside trap and sidefoots a volley past Griffiths and into the left-hand side of the net. City save themselves with nine minutes to go!81 min: Cheltenham were about to replace May with Williams, but Azaz comes off instead.80 min: Azaz is down with cramp. No wonder, he’s been everywhere.79 min: Cancelo, 25 yards out on the right, cuts inside and looks for the bottom left. His curler floats harmlessly past the post.78 min: Gundogan chips into the box from the right. Foden heads well over the bar from eight yards.77 min: Another City change, as Mendy is replaced by Cancelo.76 min: Fernandinho floats a speculative ball into the Cheltenham box. Raglan very calmly cushions a header back to Griffiths.75 min: The tension is palpable. Imagine if this place was rammed with punters!73 min: The ball flicks off Raglan and a corner is conceded from distance. The first, on the left, is headed clear by Boyle under extreme pressure, and leads to a second on the right. Mahrez curls it to the near post, but Freestone is there to skelp clear.72 min: City stroke it around the middle, but Cheltenham are holding their shape and there’s no way through.70 min: Foden slips a ball down the inside right for Mahrez, who is one on one with Griffiths but slams his effort straight at the keeper. Take nothing away from the save, but Mahrez should have scored. Throw in the goal and the earlier miss by Jesus, and City might be starting to worry that this is written in the stars.69 min: Gundogan’s first job is to whip the free kick over everybody in the box and out of play. Griffiths takes care over the goal kick, with professional clock management very much in mind.68 min: Torres drops a shoulder with a view to haring down the right. He’s checked illegally by Freestone. Before the free kick can be taken, City replace Harwood-Bellis and Doyle with Dias and Gundogan, while Cheltenham swap Lloyd with Long.66 min: Azaz, quarterbacking from deep, tries to release May down the inside-right channel. Steffen races out of his area to intercept just in time.64 min: City look visibly shocked at what Cheltenham have done to them. A lot of movement on the bench, as a beyond-livid Guardiola prepares to ring the changes.62 min: Some space for Mahrez to run into down the right. He romps into the box but his low cross-cum-shot is blocked by the ever-sensational Tozer. Cheltenham clear their lines.61 min: Laporte claims an illegal shove, but there really wasn’t much in the challenge from Raglan. And there’s no VAR, so the referee’s decision is final. He talks himself into the book.Here comes another of Tozer’s long throws. He flings it in from the left. Raglan causes some confusion at the near post, beating Laporte. The ball rolls off Raglan’s back and drops to May, who roofs it from six yards! One of the biggest shocks in FA Cup history is on!57 min: Laporte clears the corner with a fine Tozereque header. It’s the biggest compliment I can give him.56 min: Some more fancy footwork from the excellent Azaz, and he earns enough space to slip Boyle into a bit of space down the left. Boyle wins a corner.54 min: Azaz spins away from Fernandinho with Brazilian grace. His attempt to subsequently release May is no good, but never mind that. A lovely bit of skill to escape the attention of one of the best defensive midfielders in the country. 53 min: Foden slips Jesus clear down the middle. A gorgeously weighted pass. Jesus takes it without breaking stride, enters the box and ... sidefoots past Griffiths but shaves the outside of the right-hand post. What a miss!51 min: A free kick for City out on the right. Doyle curls it towards Jesus, who lets it slap his startled face. The ball twangs harmlessly out for a goal kick.50 min: May spots Steffen off his line, but gets his cheeky attempt at a long-distance lob all wrong. The ball clanks off the top of the stand behind and out of the stadium with perfect comic timing. May has the good grace to grin sheepishly.49 min: Foden takes the resulting free kick, and puts too much on it. City soon come back at Cheltenham, Torres trying something spectacular from a tight angle on the right. It flies over the bar.48 min: Raglan is booked for a needlessly aggressive lunge on Jesus. He’s lucky Jesus got out of the way, because that could have got quite unpleasant if there was big contact. Not the best challenge.47 min: Griffiths sends a long free kick into the City box. Boyle wins the header but the ball sails out harmlessly for a goal kick.46 min: Fernandinho tries to slide a pass down the right channel for Torres. Who intercepts? Tozer intercepts. He’s having a hell of a game.Cheltenham get the second half underway. No changes for either side.Half-time entertainment. No replays this year, of course, so let’s go back to the era of the marathon tie.What a magnificent display. No, not the fireworks: fourth-tier Cheltenham Town. They’ve been brilliant to a man so far, though special notices should be posted for Tozer, Griffiths and Azaz. It’s not even that City have been particularly bad. It’s just the FA Cup, is all. The magic of the FA Cup. Can it last another 45 minutes for Cheltenham? We’ll be on the verge of a sensation if so!45 min +5: Now Tozer does some tidying up at the back. He’s been the man of the match so far, not least because of that astonishing goalline clearance.45 min +4: Another opportunity for Tozer to do his thing. In comes the throw from the left. Mahrez hooks this one clear.45 min +3: Clements curls the corner in with pace. Steffen does extremely well to punch clear under extreme pressure.45 min +2: The first opportunity for Tozer to showcase his long throw. He towels the ball down, then flings it in from the left. Laporte is forced to head it behind, a melee having developed at the near post.45 min +1: The first of six extra minutes passes by.45 min: The fireworks fizzle out, and the game restarts. Cheltenham nearly catch City cold, Griffiths launching long, Boyle flicking on, Lloyd clattering into the back of Laporte on the penalty spot as he fought to get a shot away. Free kick for City.43 min: Both sets of players congregate by the touchline, waiting for the display to stop. It doesn’t stop. The referee has a word with the local bobby, who runs off to see what’s what.41 min: Some fireworks outside the stadium. A couple land on the field of play, and referee Stuart Attwell has no option but to take the players off.39 min: Mahrez dribbles down the inside-left channel and curls hard towards the top left. Griffiths parries the shot high into the sky, then claims at the second attempt.38 min: Doyle nicks the ball off Azaz, but in doing so, hysterically shanks the ball out for a corner. City deal with the set piece easily enough, and suddenly Mahrez is tearing clear down the right. He crosses in the hope of finding Foden, but Tozer is positioned well to head clear.36 min: Jesus is blocked by Tozer’s arm as he darts down the left. He wants a penalty but he’s not getting it. The ball’s worked back to Fernandinho, who creams a shot towards the top left. It’s always heading wide, and Griffiths had it covered anyway.34 min: Doyle ships possession meekly and Cheltenham stream forward in attack. Azaz drives down the middle then slips a pass wide to Freestone, who is in plenty of space but hesitates and is eventually forced to turn tail. Just for a second there, City looked light at the back and Cheltenham were carrying a threat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f28d6eaca587b57e858e569b3fe132cef6e9477/0_0_5446_3628/master/5446.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=230df807e6d913639d2a8f0192255434 1760w","title":"lost on the frontline covid nurse coronavirus","story":"Yolanda Coar was 40 when she died of Covid-19 in August 2020 in Augusta, Georgia.

Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said this was a “public health decision” to get the first jab to more people across the country.However, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the council of the British Medical Association (BMA), said the gap could reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. He said that while he understood the rationale behind the decision to delay the second dose, the UK should follow “best practice” and reduce the wait time to six weeks.The PfizerBioNTech Covid jab is an mRNA vaccine. Essentially, mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (“transcribed”) into a piece of mRNA, which in turn gets “read” by the cell’s tools for synthesising proteins.In the case of an mRNA vaccine, the virus’s mRNA is injected into the muscle, and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins – which can’t by themselves cause disease – just as if they’d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that, studies suggest, lasts for some time.The two first Covid-19 vaccines to announce phase 3 three trial results were mRNA-based. They were first off the blocks because, as soon as the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 was known – it was\u0026nbsppublished\u0026nbspby the Chinese in January 2020 – companies that had been working on this technology were able to start producing the virus’s mRNA. Making conventional vaccines takes much longer.Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre, University of BristolWhile there is some evidence from trials of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine that a late second dose up to 12 weeks does not interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine, Pfizer has said there is no evidence from its trials.Nagpaul pointed to analysis from the World Health Organization that said second doses of the Pfizer vaccine should only be delayed “in exceptional circumstances” and recommended a gap of four weeks between doses.“Most nations in the world are facing challenges similar to the UK in having limited vaccine supply and also wanting to protect their population maximally. No other nation has adopted the UK’s approach,” Nagpaul told BBC Breakfast on Saturday.“Obviously the protection will not vanish after six weeks but what we do not know is what level of protection will be offered … we should not be extrapolating data where we don’t have it. I do understand the trade-off and the rationale but if that was the right thing to do then we would see other nations following suit.“The concern we have … if the vaccine’s efficacy is reduced … then of course the risk is that we will see those who are exposed maximally to the virus may get infected,” he added. “The other worry is that members of the population, those who are at highest risk, may not be protected.”According to the government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, unpublished data suggests the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is still effective when the doses are administered 12 weeks apart. However, Pfizer said it had only tested the vaccine’s efficacy when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart.The BMA has written privately to Whitty to express its concern over the gap between doses. The letter, seen by the BBC, said the policy was “difficult to justify”.“The absence of any international support for the UK’s approach is a cause of deep concern and risks undermining public and the profession’s trust in the vaccination programme,” it said.The letter also expressed concern that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine “does not produce sufficient neutralising antibodies and the potential to reduce transmission”.The Public Health England medical director, Prof Yvonne Doyle, defended the decision to delay the vaccine, saying it was based on “public health and scientific advice”.“The more people that are protected against this virus, the less opportunity it has to get the upper hand. Protecting more people is the right thing to do,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“People will get their second dose. As supplies become available more people will be vaccinated. It is a reasonable scientific balance on the basis of both supply and also protecting the most people.”The NHS originally planned to offer second shots of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks after the first, in line with the procedure in the trials, but the soaring infection rate forced a rethink in late December with the JCVI recommending first shots for as many people as possible in the highest-risk groups.“This is highly likely to have a greater public health impact in the short term and reduce the number of preventable deaths from Covid-19,” a JCVI statement said.• This article was amended on 23 January 2021 to remove an incorrect reference in the standfirst to the “British Medical Council”.

File photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergIrish customers of CurrysPC World have been hit with a fresh setback after orders were cancelled by the shop because of what it described as “teething issues caused by a change in delivery processes”.It is the third Brexit-related problem to beset the electronics retailer since the beginning of the year. Many of its customers have been forced to contend with delivery delays of more than three weeks as a result of the decision by the logistics company used by the retailer to suspend deliveries to the Republic for weeks while it sorted out issues related to Brexit. That was just the start of a difficult month for CurrysPC World. A large number of customers who did manage to have products delivered were less than pleased when they were hit with VAT and other taxes and charges, sometimes in excess of €200, despite the fact they bought products from its Irish-based site.The company subsequently admitted the taxes and charges were imposed in error and it has said customers who where charged in error have been refunded. However in the latest issue, CurrysPC World systems have unilaterally cancelled some customers’ orders blaming what it said were Brexit-related teething issues. “All impacted customers are currently being contacted to apologise and to let them know their order has unfortunately been cancelled,” a spokeswoman told The . She said the retailer was “working hard to refund them as quickly as possible”. The spokeswoman stressed that it would honour “any promotional sales prices” if people wish to re-order their products even though the sales periods will most likely have come to an end. “We are also offering a €30 e-voucher to apologise for the inconvenience,” she said and she added that the “issue has now been resolved for future orders placed at currys.ie”. With regard to the customs issues that it had last week, she said that all orders are shipped from its central distribution centre in Newark, England. She said the retailer was “working hard to contact affected customers and refund them any duty paid” and she reiterated that “no Irish customers will have to pay duty on orders”. She concluded by saying that DPD European Road Services have now resumed deliveries. “There is a slight backlog due to the pause in services, however this issue is resolved.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics an uncomfortable week for leo varadkar","story":"This week the spotlight has been well and truly on Tánaiste Leo Varadkar following the release of internal Department of Health emails, which provide fresh insight into the controversial leaking of a GP contract back in April 2019.

File photograph: Alan BetsonEU member states have not “adequately respected” the principle of burdensharing in the loss of fish quotas post-Brexit and Ireland has been disproportionately affected, according to Minister for the Marine Charlie McConalogue.“We are not at all happy in relation to the additional burden we are taking and it is something I will be taking every opportunity to try and address,” Mr McConalogue told the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.At the meeting, conducted remotely, the fisheries sector warned of up to one in four jobs being lost around the coast, the closure of processing plants and the devastation of coastal communities in the deal where Ireland has lost 15 per cent of its fish quota at a cost of €43 million. The Minister acknowledged that the quota loss for other member states is “considerably less”.Ireland will lost 26 per cent of its mackerel quota by 2025, 14 per cent of prawns, with further substantial reductions in whitefish stocks including 23 per cent of haddock and 20 per cent of monkfish.Chief executive of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation Patrick Murphy said that “25 per cent of our fish is lost. That to me is simple mathematics - 25 per cent of our industry has to go”. One in four people around the coast would lose their jobs “not because stocks are in poor condition, not because the fish aren’t in our waters but because we had to give it away for the benefit of others”, he said.Chief executive of the Killybegs Fishermen’s Organisation Seán O’Donoghue said Ireland should be losing €21 million at most in fish quota, not €43 million, which was far more quota than the eight other coastal EU states. The Minister said that at a meeting on Thursday with EU negotiator Michel Barnier, EU Fisheries Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius and ministers from the eight fisheries member states, he “strongly expressed my disappointment that the principle of burden sharing within the EU Member States has not been adequately respected”.Ireland provides “rich fishing grounds for EU Member States and our Exclusive Economic Zone provides spawning and nursery grounds on many of the core stocks”, he added.“I made clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly. I pushed strongly that a mechanism must be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions.” When Donegal Independent TD Thomas Pringle asked about the response at the meeting to his comments, Mr McConalogue said that no one “is expecting other states to be coming forward to offer their fish but that is the battle” they faced, and he would be raising the issue again at Monday’s EU fisheries council and at every opportunity.“We are at one with the fishing sector that the outcome does not reflect the principle of burden sharing.”The Minister was pressed by a number of TDs about the composition of the taskforce he planned to establish. Mr McConalogue said he would consider proposals from the committee. But it was not just the fishing catch involved but the processing sector and employment in spin-off areas including the boat sector and engineering as well as the local economy.Sinn Féin Donegal TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, who is also a member of Good Friday Agreement committee, said that “fishers on the island are being pitted against each other” and they did not want to be ided by this. He called for all parties and organisations to be united in a call for what they wanted, which was a better deal."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"world view biden s inauguration and the meaning of january 6th","story":"The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

The fact that the question is being asked at all just four months before the planned elections to the Scottish Parliament suggests that something is indeed rotten in the state of Denmark. The tragedy for all those who genuinely care about the truth behind this dispute, who value honesty and justice above concerns over the constitutional future of Scotland – in other words, no more than a couple of dozen people in Scotland – is that the two simply cannot be disentangled. So far has political debate been corroded in the last two decades that every opinion expressed about anything – whether on this dispute or hospital waiting lists or working class kids’ access to higher education or the Covid vaccine rollout – is viewed through the holder’s attitude towards independence.This sorry tale reflects badly on both sides of the constitutional debate and on both sides of the internecine SNP quarrel. Even before Salmond’s trial on charges of serious sexual assault – charges on which he was acquitted after trial last year – Unionists were confidently predicting the collapse of the SNP, whichever way the trial went. It says something deeply worrying that instead of relying on positive arguments in favour of Scotland’s continuing role in the United Kingdom to defend the Union against nationalism, its advocates found themselves grasping for this unexpected straw and relying on the SNP itself to deal the fatal blow against their own cause that their opponents had proved incapable of dealing themselves.On the nationalist side it is just as worrying that the women who came forward to press charges against Salmond were denigrated across social media by Salmond’s supporters (with one of them even ending up in court after identifying the complainants publicly) and accused of endangering the whole independence cause. To the vast majority of Scots, the ongoing dispute is hard to follow and threatens to be too boring to affect anyone’s vote anyway. The Scottish Parliament inquiry into the Scottish Government’s own internal inquiry into initial allegations against Salmond has come down to who knew what and when. The latest “bombshell” surrounds allegations – supported by four separate witnesses – that a senior Scottish Government official who works closely with Sturgeon requested that a press release should be changed so that the fact of when exactly they knew about the allegations could be made more ambiguous. Instead of “knowing” of the allegations on a particular date, could the wording be changed to “suspected”?All of this is important because Sturgeon’s initial statement to Holyrood, that she was told for the first time about the allegations on 2 April 2018, could yet be proved to be inaccurate, though only by a matter of days. You can see why your average voter might shrug at such an inconsistency. The problem is that when Salmond himself challenged the veracity of the first minister’s statement regarding timing, her spokesperson responded in the most caustic of ways by accusing him of “spinning false conspiracy theories”. That difference of just four days seems to be vital to both Sturgeon’s and Salmond’s cases. Had it been less so, Sturgeon could easily have apologised immediately and said she had just got her dates mixed up. Instead she doubled down, raised the stakes and got journalists, if not the viewing public, arching an eyebrow and wondering what else is here to discover.First ministers have resigned for less before now. Labour’s Henry McLeish, whose tenure at Bute House lasted only a year, resigned over a “muddle, not a fiddle” over his constituency expenses and was subsequently vindicated. If Sturgeon has indeed deliberately misled the Scottish parliament, even on such a seemingly small matter, she will have breached the ministerial code and held the parliament in contempt.That would not mean she would have to resign, however. Scottish politics is not like politics elsewhere. Campaigners for independence will not be prepared to see The Project delayed or even derailed just to satisfy some democratic principles. SNP MSPs are the most disciplined political cohort ever seen – far more so than any intake of Labour MPs under Tony Blair – and can be relied upon, every single one of them, to vote to support Sturgeon if and when the crunch point arrives.This tendency to see every issue, including ministerial misbehaviour, through the prism of independence has another side to it. Even if Sturgeon herself is forced to step down this side of the Holyrood elections, even if the SNP election campaign is temporarily hobbled as a result, none of this affects the state of the Union. True, there are plenty of former No voters who are tempted to switch sides because they’ve been impressed by Sturgeon’s leadership, especially during the pandemic. But the facts of the case for and against separation will remain unaffected at their core by any dramatic resignations or other developments in the Holyrood chamber. Unionists may win an undeserved reprieve, but after the dust has settled they will still have to persuade Scots that independence would be an act of national self-harm.Similarly, on the other side of the argument, Sturgeon’s departure would be seen as no more than a small blip on what they see as the inevitable progress towards full nationhood. In another context, in another country, the details of this dispute might be seen as having profound implications for the accountability of ministers and elected officials, for the role of civil servants and the courts. In Scotland 2021 it’s all about independence. And we can’t even muster the self-respect to be embarrassed about that.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine tracker how many my area postcode tracker uk","story":"Several counties in England are close to giving all over 80s their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, new data shows, paving the way for more people on the Government\u0027s priority list to begin receiving their jabs. Over three quarters of those aged 80 and over in Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Lancashire and South Cumbria have now received a first dose, according to vaccination totals published by NHS England running up to January 17.You can see how your area compares using our postcode tool below. The data, which breaks down vaccination totals by Integrated Care System (ICS) or Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP), also reveals that Northamptonshire has given out the highest proportion of second doses in the country, with more than one in five over 80s - 22.5 per cent - getting both jabs. That compares to Nottinghamshire, where just 0.5 per cent, or one in every 200 over 80s, had received two jabs by January 17.Overall, Gloucestershire, Hereford and Worcestershire have given out the most jabs - more than one dose for every ten people.In these areas more than nine per cent of all people have so far received their first dose.The latest figures come alongside national statistics showing that across the UK just under 5m people have now received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while over 460,000 have received a second dose and are in turn fully vaccinated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that successful vaccination by mid-February of the Government\u0027s top four priority groups - a total of 15 million elderly and vulnerable people as well as frontline workers - is a crucial milestone for the UK to hit before ministers cans begin to ease lockdown rules.That would mean a further 10m vaccinations over the next four weeks - or 2.5m a week - yet the UK is currently only giving out 2.1m first doses a week, the latest data shows.Originally the NHS published three running totals of the number of vaccinations given in the UK on a weekly basis, beginning on December 31. From that time new doses have stood at around 0.3m administered every seven days. The NHS broke down these totals by whether the doses administered had been a person\u0027s first or their second, with the latter kind of jab only first taking place in the UK within the week ending January 3.However, the NHS has now begun publishing more local data as the pace of vaccination increases nationally, revealing that the North East and Yorkshire leads on first doses for over 80s - more than 67 per cent between December 8 and January 17.More than two thirds of the oldest age group have also received their first dose in the North West, with the lowest proportion in London. Just 49.8 per cent of over 80s in the capital had received their first dose by January 17.Large numbers in younger age groups have also been receiving their first dose, with more than one in every 100 people aged below 49 being given their first jab in the South West, South East, North West and North East and Yorkshire during the first month of the programme.In terms of second jabs, the East of England has fully vaccinated the highest proportion of over 80s during the first month of vaccinations.The region has now given 12.4 per cent of over 80s their second dose of the jab, up from 11.9 per cent the previous week.The lowest is in the Midlands - at 8.8 per cent - up just half a percentage point from the week prior.All of the doses given so far have been for the Government\u0027s first set of priority groups - a total of 32m people that includes everyone over the age of 50 as well as all frontline workers and people with underlying conditions that make them highly vulnerable Covid-19. The nine groups are below - and it is the people within the first four groups, comprising 15m people, that the Government is aiming to offer doses to by mid-February:When asked how the Government will identify which key workers need the vaccine more urgently, the Health Secretary shared that 99 per cent of deaths are in the top nine groups of the JCVI guidelines. After that, the goal is to reduce transmission and get back to normal as soon as possible.The figures now being published have only just begun to include the rollout of the now-approved OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, which began on Monday, January 4 and is expected to take place at a faster pace than previous vaccinations. Before then the NHS had only been administering the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, which was first given patients on December 9 but is more expensive and harder to distribute logistically than the Oxford vaccine.Nicola Sturgeon is facing mounting anger over Scotland\u0027s slow vaccine roll-out after it emerged her government has more than 400,000 unused doses and England\u0027s deployment was almost twice as fast last weekend.The First Minister on Monday disclosed that 264,991 people north of the Border have been given their first dose but The  understands her government has now been handed more than 700,000 doses from the UK\u0027s supplies.In Wales, Mark Drakeford, the  First Minister, defended the slower rollout of the vaccination programme, saying supplies of the Pfizer jab were being stretched out so that vaccinators were not standing idle.A fast rollout so far means the UK stands relatively strong in the international rankings of vaccinations. So far the UK is ranked 4th in the world, according to statistics compiled by Our World in Data, a team of statistical researchers based in Oxford. However, Israel has pulled ahead significantly in the international rankings at the moment, having administered doses that amount to around a fifth of its population. The Middle Eastern nation has embarked on a highly ambitious vaccination drive, drawing on its well funded healthcare system, high levels of medical record digitisation and strong logistical infrastructure to administer doses to a large segment of people already. When it comes to its European neighbours, the UK has pulled ahead and taken the top spot, standing well above the likes of France, Germany and Italy. On Jan 16, The  exclusively revealed that Britain would have the capacity to vaccinate the entire nation against new coronavirus strains within four months, once a new “super-factory” opens this year.The factory, which is worth £158m, will produce 70m doses of an emergency vaccine in the UK, Dr Matthew Duchars, chief executive of the Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre (VMIC), shared. Speaking to The , Dr Duchars revealed: “New Covid variants are absolutely part of the thinking. We probably will need to make seasonal vaccine variants because there may well be mutations in the virus, as well as vaccines for other diseases.

The great political argument of the twentieth century between a totalitarianism that promised lifelong protection, and open democracy which took the riskier path of liberty seemed to have been settled when communism collapsed and its Western acolytes, for the most part, gave up the fight. Or at least re-framed their position in a way that could accommodate the winning side.Democratic socialism (or “social democracy” if you prefer the more benign title) made an attempt to meld the two visions into some acceptable consensus about how societies could incorporate economic security with inidual self-determination. These solutions varied from country to country and from one political party to another - and teetered constantly on the edges of credibility. The Middle Way between government guarantees of what Gordon Brown used to call “social fairness” and free market economics never seemed satisfactory.But the really big philosophical choice had been made when the Berlin Wall came down. For human beings to lead fulfilled adult lives, they had to be free to take decisions that might involve risk to themselves and possibly even to others, for which they could be held personally accountable. And furthermore, they were fully aware of this truth, which is why they were determined to fight for freedom even when that fight involved very considerable danger.Of course, in the present context, the notion of risk is quite immediate and absolute. Liberty is no use to you if you are dead, and few people would claim that you should have the right to put other people’s lives in jeopardy. And we are not, however much political rhetoric has been expended, in anything like a war with a sentient enemy. By shutting down so many of the most fundamental personal freedoms we are going further than most countries would ever have done in wartime but we are not handing any sort of moral victory to the enemy – because there is no enemy. This is not an ideological battle with an alien force. It is an argument we must have with ourselves.I don’t propose to engage yet again in the dispute over the present lockdown restrictions – whether they are effective and how urgent it is to lift them. What interests me is how public opinion has responded to these measures. Do people want to be free? Or do they want to be, above all else, safe? Both, paradoxically, but when it comes to an unavoidable choice which way do they go? It isn’t the imposition of these measures that needs examination here but the willingness to comply with them: the positive eagerness to embrace such unprecedented repression to the point of demanding more of it.Have we stumbled onto something that was thought to have been extinguished in modern life, at least in the West, but was really a still powerful (maybe ineradicable) force in society? It’s certainly true that when the Soviet system crashed, a great many of the citizens who had lived under it were terrified and appalled: they had genuinely believed the communist state to be the guarantor of stability and survival. But the chaos into which Russia descended, having sold off all its publicly owned assets in a corrupt fire sale, had a great deal to do with that. This wasn’t freedom: it was anarchy and instant impoverishment.But in the West, there was a glorious moment of belief in the value of enterprise and inidualism. In Britain, this had come about as a reaction against the producer-capture of the public services by Leftwing trade unions. So furious was the reaction against state control and nationalised industry, that Labour had to reinvent itself as a party committed to capitalism. Freedom won that round hands down, helped very considerably by the ability of political leaders of the day to identify and articulate the dissatisfactions that really were dominating everyday life.Is that the formula? For freedom, or security, to dominate public consciousness, must there be that critical combination of ordinary experience, and leadership which knows how to capture and express it – thereby gaining popular trust? If that is so, then it might help us to understand what is going on around us today. The attraction of freedom is that it embodies hope. That is the whole point of it: the hope that people will behave well when they have choices, and that a better future can be created out of human ingenuity and endeavour.The longing for security, on the other hand, is based on fear: the belief that life (and other people) are so inherently threatening that only an all-powerful institution (or state) can ensure your survival. So it is not difficult to see how the Covid pandemic could present an opportunity for political leaders to craft a message that makes use of fear which will win out over any possible dissent.Fear will always be a more urgent driver of behaviour than hope, and it is much easier for governments to act on. With enough enforcement and authoritarian regulation, you can deliver a reasonable degree of safety from almost any danger, and righteously suppress any contrary argument. Freedom, on the other hand, is a much more problematic thing to defend. It needs (by definition) constant debate, examination and re-definition. It is an exhausting business that requires an enlightened populace and a government willing to engage in ongoing disputation of quite an abstract kind. Most politicians would be inclined to dislike the precariousness that this involves. (Margaret Thatcher and her mentor, Keith Joseph, were among the few who relished it.)Perhaps the most important thing we have learned from this deranging time in our history is that fear remains such a strong human impetus that it can easily stampede all the principles that were assumed to underpin democracy. Does this make it more likely that governments will be prepared to close down all social interaction again, in response to future crises? Almost certainly, and maybe not just for disease epidemics – perhaps for crime waves, terror threats, rioting or mass unrest of any kind. After all, look how easy it was this time.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive notorious albanian gangster smuggles mobile phone","story":"An Albanian gangster jailed for 27-years for smuggling huge quantities of heroin and cocaine into Britain has been making a mockery of justice by running a social media account from his prison cell.Posing with fellow gang members, Valjet Pepaj, has even used Instagram to flirt with women on the outside, boasting that he expects to be free in four years.The 31-year-old was given a lengthy sentence in April 2018 after admitting three counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.He was jailed alongside two other men following a six month undercover police operation which resulted in the seizure of 50 kilograms of heroin and cocaine, worth in excess of £2 million.Pepaj was believed to be the head of a ruthless Albanian organised criminal gang that was muscling its way into the UK drug dealing market.When he was jailed a senior Scotland Yard detective said: “The sentencing reflects the level of criminality these defendants were involved in and should be seen as a strong deterrent for others involved in the importation and distribution of Class A drugs.”But it has now emerged that he and some of his former gang members have been using illegal mobile phones in prison to keep in contact with their families and friends via social media.Private Instagram accounts, that The  has seen, show Pepaj posing in designer clothing in his cell with other inmates.In the picture below he can be seen alongside fellow Albanian gangster, Edi Vyzaj (left), who was jailed for 18-years for his role in the same drug smuggling plot.On Christmas Eve Pepaj posted a message to his family and friends which said: “Wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas.”The following day Vyzaj posted a video on social media of him with another prisoner complete with an ironic Covid-19 slogan, ‘Stay Home’.Just after 4pm on Christmas Day, Pepaj also had a long exchange on Instagram with an Albanian undercover reporter posing as a female who wanted to make his acquaintance.When asked where he lived Pepaj replied: “I live in England in prison.” Pressed on how long he had to serve, he glossed over the reality and said: “I have to do four more years.”Asked if he was allowed to have a mobile phone in prison he replied: “It’s not allowed but we have it.”The following day the pair exchanged messages again and this time the reporter said she did not believe he was in prison and asked him to prove it.At that point Pepaj sent a short video showing the bars on his cell. Pepaj then sent a short video showing the windows of his jail.The undercover reporter then suggested they speak directly on WhatsApp and asked him to provide his mobile phone number which he did, telling her to call him after 4pm.It is illegal for prisoners to have and use mobile phones, but they are often smuggled into jails along with other contraband and change hands for up to £1,000 each.Each year prison staff find and confiscate around 20,000 phones and SIM cards and inmates who are caught with the devices can face up to two more years in prison.A prison service source said the authorities had been made aware of the allegations about Pepaj and his friends using mobile phones in their cells and were looking into the matter.A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “We are spending £100 million on prison security, including X-ray body scanners, signal-blocking technology and dogs trained to sniff out mobiles.“Anyone caught with a phone will be punished and faces two additional years behind bars.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"former mi6 chief says shocked not consulted decision use huawei","story":"A former MI6 chief says he was “shocked” not to be consulted over the decision to use Huawei technology in British infrastructure.Sir Richard Dearlove said he had been “militant” at the time the original decision was taken as he felt the government was “going in the wrong direction”.Speaking to the Danube Institute, a think tank, Sir Richard, head of the Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, from 1999 to 2004, said he never believed assurances that allowing the Chinese technology giant into Britain\u0027s 5G infrastructure was safe.“The problem is I’ve been trained as a poacher, not as a gamekeeper,” he said. “If you’re a poacher you know what you can achieve.”“I was Chief when the original deal was signed with Huawei and at the time we were not consulted. “The government let this go through and some of us, when we heard about it, were intensely shocked. “We were becoming partially dependent on Chinese technology and I think there’s no question now with 5G this is something we need to scale back and we need to be wary of.The former spy, who has in the past criticised David Cameron and George Osborne as “enthusiastic China huggers” added he was “thrilled” the government last year reversed its decision to allow Huawei into the most sensitive areas of the country’s communications network.    In 2003 telecommunications firm BT notified the government of Huawei’s interest in the £10billion 5G infrastructure deal, then known as the 21st Century Network contract.However, in evidence given later to an investigation into Huawei’s interest by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), the Cabinet Office said officials at the time had chosen not to refer the matter to Ministers, or even inform them, until 2006, a year after the contract had been signed.The 2013 ISC report said officials knew at the time of legal mechanisms by which Huawei’s interest could have been blocked but assessed “the potential trade, financial and diplomatic consequences of using them would be too significant”.The then Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, told the committee she had discussed the contract with BT, but only in relation to the competition aspects of the decision and the implications for UK business, rather than any security concerns. Officials did not take the opportunity of her involvement to raise security issues with her.“There was no justification for failing to consult Ministers about the situation when BT first notified officials of Huawei’s interest,” the report concluded. “Such a sensitive decision, with potentially damaging ramifications, should have been put in the hands of Ministers.” In 2010 the National Security Council (NSC) was established by David Cameron to bring greater coherence to issues of security, intelligence coordination and defence strategy. The NSC today has representation from  GCHQ, MI6, MI5 and other departments as required to ensure issues of potential security concern are exposed early to all relevant parties.Sir Richard said the government had been “incredibly naive” over the handling of Britain’s commercial relationship with China, offering only an “easy-going” and “uncritical” approach in the past.He said any future trading relationship with China needs to be “managed quite aggressively”.“We’re not there to be set up and exploited. We’re there to have a controlled trading relationship. It’s very challenging and very difficult to find out what that’s going to be. “In the UK we have the specific problem of Hong Kong, although the Chinese claim it’s nothing to do with us now...and the question of the treatment of Uighur muslims.“I’m an opponent of moral foreign policy.

The added journey times as well as the difficulties faced in travelling between schools is causing stress and really impacting on the quality of education we are able to provide.”Ms Sampson explained how her normal ten minute drive to work now takes 40 minutes due to gridlock on main routes. She adds: “I can sit for up to 25 minutres in stationary traffic. Sometimes I park and walk to the school but have so much to carry I have to make several journeys thus making my start to the working day very laborious. I now leave half an hour earlier each morning but still arrive much later for work.”Meanwhile, she has had to challenge tickets issued to staff fined when travelling from one school to another and who “no longer want the challenge of the journey”.She said a teacher within the trust was “extremely distressed” when summoned to her own twin’s nursery after the pair fell ill because the normally short journey took an hour and a half. Meanwhile, another staff member’s formerly short trip to see her parents in a care home in  Streatham after work now requires a three hour round trip.She added how parents had also expressed concerns about the changes to the nature of travel in the borough. The council also received a letter from Harris City Academy which said the closures had “put significant strain on our staff at a time when they are already under so much pressure.”Referring to increased journey times due to a series of bottlenecks, it says: “This is likely to lead to resignations and possibly even some feeling like they are unable to balance teaching as a profession with their home lives.”A Croydon council spokesperson said, “We received correspondence from the local schools as part of our public engagement, and have taken their concerns into consideration.

Nothing remained apart from 3,598 iron rivets which once held its oak planks tightly together.  Once the sandy infill had been excavated, the rivets were left like a join-the-dots puzzle forming a virtual blueprint of the longship’s original design.The drama charts the tensions as the significance of the discovery is realised by the British Museum’s own experts who had initially shown little interest.  Despite having been the one who made the discovery Brown was sidelined and replaced by the Museum’s own chosen expert, a professor from Cambridge University.As filming took place last summer a team of shipwrights and volunteers from the Sutton Hoo Ships Company was scouring Britain for oak trees to remake the ship.  The search for a tree of suitable size took them from Northumberland, where they surveyed a forest planted for the Royal Navy by Nelson’s second in command Admiral Collingwood after Trafalgar, to Windsor Great Park, home to some of the largest oaks in Britain.The search for the keel ended when the Trust’s chief shipwright Tim Kirk found a tall straight trunked tree in Forestry England woodland near Swindon after nearly a year of searching. Once the tree had been felled the ship builders had to move fast as they needed to use the wood while it is still “green” and malleable. Ten oaks will be planted in its place.The 14m long trunk arrived in Woodbridge last week to join timber that will form the clinker planking, decks and ribs of the longship.  It is hoped the reconstruction will help answer some of the still outstanding questions about the Sutton Hoo ship, which was around 30 years old when it was used in the burial of an Anglo Saxon chieftain.First science is trying to find out whether it was built in England or Scandinavia.  Anglo Saxons who crossed the North Sea from Denmark and northern Germany settled in England after the departure of the Romans left little trace here of any tradition of ship building.  There is no surviving vessel built within 200 years either side of the Sutton Hoo longship.  Although the hull had completely vanished there are traces of timber planking trapped in the rusty rivets and DNA testing should reveal whether it was built of English or European oak. Analyses of the rivets themselves suggests they were made from “bog iron” an iron ore gathered locally in East Anglia.Once the replica is put through its paces on the River Deben, which runs close to the burial site, it will swiftly become clear whether it was rowed or sailed.  No trace of a mast remained but the central portion of the hull had been adapted to hold a wooden structure which was used as a burial chamber so it may just have been removed. Neither was there any no trace of its occupant, thought by some historians to have been King Raedwald, the first English king to convert to Christianity who died around 624, apart from a kingsize stain in the sand.The volunteers building the longship are using the same tools as their Anglo-Saxon predecessors, which means no saws, only axes to cut the 90 planks needed for the hull.  The dozens of volunteers include a retired eye surgeon, several engineers and a former accountant who left her job to re-train as a shipwright but had no idea where to practise her new skills until she came across the Ship’s Company.Philip Leech, a retired GP who chairs the charity, said that one of the things that still needed to be resolved was whether the boat was primarily rowed or sailed.   That in turn could give a clue as to whether it was a warship, a trading vessel or a royal barge.He said: “Did they row standing up or sitting down? Perhaps the oarsmen each had a box of personal possessions which they could have sat on.”  He is full of praise for Basil Brown.  Dr Leech said: “It was perfectly cleverly excavated in 1939, the precision was stunning, you can really see every rib.”During the war the site was used as an army training ground and when the ship was re-excavated it was no longer quite as pristine as a Bren gun carrier had squashed the imprint. The mound that is there today is a recreation.The Sutton Hoo ship predated the Viking longships which raided Britain by hundreds of years. It was also an ancestor of the White Ship, the vessel in which the cream of the Britain and French nobility, including the heir to the English throne, drowned when it crashed at high speed into a rock off the Normandy port of Barfleur in 1120.  A replica of the White Ship is being built in parallel with the Sutton Hoo longship by the Oxford-based Institute for Digital Archaeology which is funding both projects. The Sutton Hoo longship is expected to cost around £350,000, considerably cheaper than a super yacht.  Eventually it will be used on the river at Woodbridge as part of a larger display related to Sutton Hoo.Roger Michel, the IDA’s executive director, said the two ships marked the beginning and the end of an era of ship design.  He said: “The White Ship will help us answer a lot of questions about the Sutton Hoo ship such as was it sailed or rowed.  “We have descriptions of the White Ship and we know it was primarily a sailing ship and the oars would have been used like a motor in a modern yacht, for manoeuvring or moving short distances.  “We want to know if the Sutton Hoo ship was the same.”The historian Charles Spencer, the brother of Princess Diana, who published a best-selling book on the White Ship last year, said: I look forward to discovering possible connections between these two historic British ships. Learning more about the construction of both will provide some insights into medieval boatbuilding practices.”The Dig, based on the historical novel by John Preston, is due for release on Netflix on January 29.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"social media trend multicoloured dogs creating extreme breeds","story":"People must stop buying \u0027lilac\u0027 and \u0027Merle\u0027 coloured dogs, which face a lifetime of skin conditions, and extreme breeds selected to resemble toads, the vice president of the British Veterinary Association warns today.Daniella Dos Santos said Instagram was driving a trend of new \u0027extreme\u0027 breeds facing a lifetime of health problems, that cost as much as £10,000.She said buyers are failing to realise that dogs whose fur is a soft lilac colour, or whose fur is affected by a genetic condition called merle which creates patches of colour and odd-colour eyes, are treated as disabled by reputable breeders.Different breeds of bulldogs are also being overbred, she warned, coming with a catalogue of health issues including how they have trouble breathing, skeletal issues and are unable to fully close their eyes.New breeds being advertised are dogs like exotic bullies, bred from the American Bully, below, that is favoured for its fearsome look and strong jaws, costing as much as £10,000 a puppy.Another example is the toad line bully, which have extremely short legs and very muscular bodies. Because of their unnaturally compact shape, they face skeletal problems as well as other health issues. The designer dog was bred with an aim of creating the smallest in size but biggest boned bulldogs possible. They sell for as much as £6,000.Ms Dos Santos also warned about the long rope French Bulldog, which are bred to have a large flap of folded skin over the nose, known as the rope, impeding breathing. They are on sale online for around £6,000It is currently against the law in Britain to knowingly breed dogs with disabling genetic conditions. However, this is rarely pursued and there has not yet been a test case.Ms Dos Santos told The  “there is a worrying rise in dogs bred to look extreme and toad-like” and criticised sellers online marketing them as exotic and desirable.She said: “What we are seeing now is a growing number of irresponsible breeders breeding extreme dogs, often called exotic bullies, muscle tone pocket bullies, long rope french bulldogs, and toadline bullies.We do have a real concern about the increase in popularity of these dogs, the health consequences that come with as well. And we are seeing that often these dogs are advertised for sale via Instagram and other social media platforms. Instead of being realistic about what these deformities mean, they are advertised as glamorous, rare and desirable. There is a link between this - people wanting the most unusual dogs and these health problems.  The trend for buying these dogs has been imported from the United States, and many of them also have to suffer having their ears cropped as puppies. The government is considering a ban on imported dogs with cropped ears after UK vets said they had seen a rise in puppies with chopped off ears in their practice. The vet explained: We are talking about really painful skin folds, where the skin is folded over and you get painful infections, we are talking about a lifetime of eye problems, they can’t shut their eyes properly, spinal problems, mobility problems, a lot of them are flat faced so come inherently with problems breathing.The colouring of the deformed puppies adds a new dimension to their lifetime of pain, Ms Dos Santos said.The breeders are trying to breed lilac coloured dogs, which is a genetic condition they are choosing for when they breed which results in skin problems, skin inflammation and hair loss. We are seeing an uptick in interest in Merle dogs. Merle genes we see intermittently in collie dogs, and we see these are associated with deafness and blindness.These breeders are choosing the colours to breed from just for the colour in the full knowledge that they have health problems. They charge huge prices for them because of their social media popularity. We are really really concerned that this is an escalating welfare problem for these dogs.“We are keen to see a wider awareness of these extreme breeds so buyers aren’t being sucked into buying these dogs and possibly signing up to a lifetime of heartbreak when the dog that becomes a member of their family and has health problems.The government has said it will crack down on this illegal practice, and that it is unacceptable for breeders to deliberately select for puppies which have painful skin conditions.A Defra spokesperson said: “The UK is a world leader in animal welfare and we are committed to cracking down on unscrupulous breeders who breed dogs purely out of financial greed at the expense of their welfare.“Our Animal Welfare Regulations prohibit the breeding of dogs where this could be reasonably expected to harm the welfare of either the mother or puppies. This includes breeding dogs to ensure that they are a particular colour, which puts them at risk of harmful skin conditions.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mark steel the tories finally","story":"NewsopinionMark Steel: \"The Tories finally have a clear message on the pandemic: Its Your Fault\"Between January  and , , cases of companies breaking the rules were reported, but the Health and Safety Executive only took action in  of themmirrorShareCommentsByMark Steel:,  JAN NewsopinionBoris Johnson claims were all in it together \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It hears drum and bass and it can’t help ing about, and viruses are notoriously bad movers so they bump into everyone and that’s how it’s carried. It thrives on wine in a plastic cup, it gets tiddly, trips up and lands on the other guests. It meanders round the house looking for Doritos and salsa dip, wiping itself on everyone’s hair. But in an office or warehouse, the virus gets bored with spreadsheets and forklt trucks, so it goes to sleep and causes no trouble. So we mustn’t blame employers.

Anyone with those classic three warning signs is urged to self-isolate and get a test immediately. The free NHS test is presently only offered to people who have one of the three official symptoms. But experts warn there are  more lesser-known symptoms of coronavirus we should all be aware of - as they warn you may need to isolate evenyou donapost have one of the classic trio. Scientists believe one reason the virus has spread so rapidly around the UK and the rest of the world - killing more than million people - because one in three people are estimated to be asymptomatic. Have you got a coronavirus story to tell  Let us know, email webnews@mirror But other symptoms connected to the deadly bug are similar to other seasonal illness, which could lead people to mistake Covid- infection for something less sinister. Researchers are urging people to be aware of other symptoms people who have tested positive for Covid- have experienced. The researchers say there are  symptoms in total, including the official three. They say the most commonly reported six outside of the three official symptoms are: headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle pains, diarrhoea, skin rash, and confusion and delirium in elderly people. They are also keeping a close eye on aposCovid tongueapos. The Zoe Covid Symptom Study is a leading UK study in collaboration with epidemiologists at Kingaposs College London.  The study tracks the symptoms of more than million people globally, and the UK app usersapos entries have been used by the Office for National Statisticsto predict case numbers across the UK. The researchers have been warning people with Covid still present with less common symptoms that donapost get on the official Public Health Englandlist - such as skin rashes. They have also recently provided a list of early warning signs, and published a study in the British Medical Journal about the six most common clusters of Covid symptoms, which you can alsoabout below. Three official NHS symptoms . New, continuous cough The NHS says aposcontinuousapos means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours. If you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual.  The persistent cough symptom is more often reported by adults aged between - than by the elderly or children, the Zoe Covid app study of a sample of , iniduals with positive test found. . High fever This early warning sign is usually one of the first key symptoms to appear - and disappears fastest, researchers say. The NHS says a fever means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back. The health service advises you do not need to measure your temperature. However in both children and adults, a temperature C is considered to be a fever. To determine whether a child has a fever, you should check whether they feel hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, feel sweaty, or look or feel unwell. According to the Zoe Covid app researchers,% of all age groups reported having a fever in the first seven days, and this is why this symptom - along with the loss of smell and persistent cough - is still among the key symptoms to be aware of.  . Loss of senses of taste and smell This is also known as aposanosmia.apos Many people who have tested positive for Covid- have noted this classic symptom lasting for weeks or months even after a very mild infection. The NHS says you should get a testyouaposve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normal. Some aposLong Covidapos sufferers have described a aposrottingapos smell. Loss of taste or sense of smell symptoms can experienced in other conditions such as a cold or sinus infection. However experts say a sudden loss of both senses is rare even with a blocked nose or sinuses. The striking Covid symptom has been known to occur without any blocked nose at all, and is a key sign you should get a test. The symptoms of loss of taste and smell are more often reported by adults aged between -, than by the elderly or children, the Zoe Covid app study found. This age group tends to report more loss of smellthan the elderly or the kids .  They say it is important to point out that same age groups may be more capable of noticing and reporting loss of smell or taste, so it can be important to test for these changes. Symptoms officially recognised in the US . Headaches Headache and fatigue have been described as the aposdark horseapos of Covid symptoms. Zoe Covid app researchers say headaches were among the most common symptoms reported before a positive test. But only % experienced headaches and fatigue alone. Only % of the app users who said they had experienced headache or fatigue went on to test positive for the virus. But the researchers did find that across all age groups that did go on to test positive, headachewas the most commonly reported early symptom. Only % of Covid-positive adults aged  -  didn’t experience headache or fatigue.  . Fatigue and severe fatigue After headaches, fatigue was the second most commonly reported symptom, with % of Covid-positive people experiencing it. A key concern about these symptoms is that tiredness - like headaches- are a relatively common and benign everyday condition for many people. Covid sufferers have described fatigue that leaves even young, fit and health people bed-ridden. Both headaches and fatigue can be triggered by a iety of causes - from a lack of sleep, to stress, or other commonplace illnesses like a cold. A iety of viruses are known to trigger debilitating post-viral fatigue, the NHS says. Thataposs why those symptoms alone may not trigger people to get a test without other hallmark symptoms, the Zoe researchers said. Chronic fatigue has also been listed as a key ongoing problem for aposLong Covidapos sufferers, ongoing research has found.  . Sore throat A sore throat is more often reported by adults aged between - than by the elderly or children, the Zoe Covid study found. However this symptom is another tricky one- as it is common in many illnesses and allergies - especially in winter when colds and flus are circulating, and kids are being struck down with throat infections. The study noted the symptom in more than halfof people who tested positive. Interestingly, it most often set in later in their symptoms. More than % had noticed a sore throat by the end of the first week of their symptoms, compared to three-quarters in the first three days.  . Unusual muscle aches United States officials updated the countryaposs guidelines late last year to include body pains. The CDC added muscle or body aches to its list of official symptoms known to appear two to  days after exposure. New York University researchers found a link between sore muscles and serious Covid- cases during an analysis of  patients in Wenzhou, China. Zoe Covid study researchers found aposunusualapos muscle aches - as in not caused by any particular activity like exercise - were experienced by nearly half of Covid-positive participants. The NHS notes many people may actually experience joint and muscle aches after Covid because unwell people are often unable to move around and exercise easily. People have told the health service the most common problems after being unwell include shoulder and back problems, and odd or altered feelings such as numbness, and pins and needles or weakness in the arms or legs. The NHS says most of these problems come after hospitalisation, and should improve quickly.  . Diarrhoea A study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, analysed data  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and found nearly  per cent had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. The Zoe Covid Study researchers found % of participants reported experiencing diarrhoea, with more than three-quarters of those noting within the first week of symptoms.  Dr Diana Gall explained to the Express : Digestion problems and changes in bowel habits - particularly looser stools and making more frequent trips to the toilet - are sometimes the first signs that you’re coming down with something, not just with this coronavirus. However, diarrhoea has been reported as an early symptom in patients who have later tested positive for Covid-.  . Shortness of breath Shortness of breath is most common among adults aged between -, the Zoe Covid app researchers found. A total % reported the symptom, compared to % of over s, and % of under-s. Andy Hardwick, , from Essex, last year described the sensation: You donapost want to talk. You get shortness of breathyou move around. You donapost want to lt your head off the pillow. It does come in waves. You will feel a slight relief sometimes and then it will go. The Zoe Covid app study dferentiates between shortness of breath and severe shortness of breath, as some sufferers go to hospital struggling to breathe at all. Oxygen or ventilation support in ICU is required for the most severe Covid cases.  Reported but not official symptoms . Skin rash and aposCovid fingers and toesapos A nurse in West Suffolk told today how her -month-old toddler with Covid developed red spots all over his face and body. Researchers have linked a iety of rashes with coronavirus  - including aposCovid fingers and toes.apos These types were noted by the Zoe Covid app and Kingaposs College researchers among .% of people in their study who tested positive for Covid-. They decided to investigate further with a survey of , people with skin rashes and suspected or confirmed Covid.  The team particularly sought images from people of colour, finding % of respondents testing positive for coronavirus reported a rash as the first symptom of the disease. One in five people who reported a rash and were confirmed as being infected with coronavirus said the rash was their only symptom. Here are the rash types the researchers have warned to keep an eye out for:Hive-type rash :  Sudden appearance of raised bumps on the skin which come and go quite quickly over hours and are usually very itchy. It can involve any part of the body, and often starts with intense itching of the palms or soles, and can cause swelling of the lips and eyelids. These rashes can present quite early on in the infection, but can also last a long time afterwards.   ‘Prickly heat’ or chickenpox-type rash :  Areas of small, itchy red bumps that can occur anywhere on the body, but particularly the elbows and knees as well as the back of the hands and feet. The rash can persist for days or weeks.   Covid fingers and toes :  Reddish and purplish bumps on the fingers or toes, which may be sore but not usually itchy. This type of rash is most specic to COVID-, is more common in younger people with the disease, and tends to present later on.Prof Spector also warned last week he was seeing more rashes associated with Covid cases. The Kingaposs College epidemiologist warned of the symptom, which is not on the PHE list. A rash on skin and discolouration of fingers or toes are all listed as less common symptoms of the virus by the World Health Organisation .  A rash is also associated with Kawasaki Disease, which mainly affects children. Children rarely fall severely ill with Covid. But they are believed to be key asymptomatic spreaders - a facgtor which eventually promptedthe closure of schools once again in Englandaposs third lockdown. Scientists are still investigating the suspected link between Covid and this extremely rare inflammatory illness. It has killed a small number of children around the world during the pandemic, including in the UK. Children with Kawasaki present with body rashes, along with other symptoms. The NHS advises parents to watch out for:a rash swollen glands in the neck dry, cracked lips red fingers or toes red eyes. Loss of appetite A loss of appetite or skipping meals are key symptoms to watch out for, experts say. The Zoe Covid app study found nearly halfof people who tested positive reported they had stopped feeling hungry, or were disinterested in eating. Racing blogger Stephen Power, who believes he contracted the disease while at Cheltenham Festival last year, described the feeling. The Londoner said: Iaposve been in bed with a nasty fever, headache, mild cough  back pain for nearly four days now, Iaposm completely exhausted and have no urge to move or eat.  . Confusion or delirium This is a really important symptom to watch out for in vulnerable elderly people, the Zoe Covid Symptom Study researchers say. Those over  reported being confused, disorientated and having severe shortness of breath more often than all other other groups. Overall these symptoms are less common in those aged -. The prevalence of this symptom among the elderly and frail has led the PHE to add it to its list. The discovery of delirium as a probable symptom first emerged from a study of Covid- patient admissions to St Thomas’ Hospital, London. The study found many of the patients presenting with confusion or delirium had no dference in fever or cough. However the elderly patients did tend to present with fatigue and shortness of breath.  Delirium also usually affects patients who require ventilator support, and is caused by a build-up of carbon dioxide in the body. What exactly is delirium  The NHS says it is as defined as:Not being able to think or speak clearly or quickly Patient not knowing where they areStruggling to pay attention or remember things Seeing or hear things that arenapost there According to online UK health directory Patient Info author Dr Mary Lowth, patients with moderate COVID- are more breathless and tend to have an increased heart rate, particularlythey are moving around. Patients with severe disease are very breathless and may be unable to breathe at a comfortable rate when they move even slightly. Breathing may be faster than usual, and they may struggle to finish sentences because their oxygen levels have fallen so low. . Chest pains The NHS  advice service describes chest pains as like a apostight band or heavy weight in or around the chest.apos Experts say this symptom can accompany a feeling or a shortness of breath in Covid cases. Seven in twenty  to -year-olds reported chest pain, the Zoe Covid app researchers found. At presents, NHS  advises people calling about chest pain to get a Covid test onlythey are also experiencing a fever or cough. . Hoarse voice One-third of Covid-positive people in the Zoe Covid Symptoms study noted a hoarse voice. Nearly nine in ten reported the symptom by the end of the first week, suggesting it develops after a few days. Experts say other symptoms of viral illness, like a sore throat and coughing can cause hoarseness. It can also be affected by a change to your ability to breathe or swallow.  . Abdominal pain As noted above, nearly  per cent in a study in Chinaaposs Hubei province experienced gastro symptoms -including abdominal pain. According to the Zoe Covid app researchers, around a quarter of participants experienced this symptom, with around three quarters noting it within the first week. Other suspected symptoms aposCovid Tongueapos An expert has just recently warned the public to watch out for so-called aposCovid tongue.apos Symptom study trackers are keeping an eye on the number of people reporting what could be a new symptom. Professor Tim Spector posted a picture of a Covid- suffereraposs red tongue on Twitter as an example. The epidemiologist at Kingaposs College London said just last week he was seeing increasing numbers of aposCovid tongueapos and aposstrange mouth ulcersapos. These can be a dficult symptoms to ascertain. The Zoe Covid Symptoms study is presently monitoring the condition treating it as a suspected symptom, as it is anecdotal at this stage. Certain diseases that affect the immune system can affect the tongue, causing changes including pain, discolouration, swelling or a strange texture. Other problems can stem from underlying health conditions, smoking, and unhealthy diet or poor mouth hygiene. Mouth ulcers are also very common and can be caused by a range of things, including consuming too-hot food or drink, vitamin deficiencies, or stress. They can also be provoked by some medicines, or hormonal changes.  A buzzing sensation Some Covid-positive people have described a a aposbuzzingapos or aposfizzingapos sensation that runs through the body. While it has not been listed as an official symptom, experts have speculated that the sensation which can also present with other viruses could be the sign your body is fighting off an infection. Dr Daniel Grfin, chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates in the US, has suggested the feeling may be part of an auto-immune response to a patientsapos nervous system. “Clearly it’s been identied, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” he told the New York Post. He said the aposzombie-likeapos feeling was also often experienced by people after they leave ICU or come off ventilators. Dr Vipul Shah, Clinical Director at telehealth service Pack Health, said such a sensation is also linked to fevers. If people arenapost used to having fevers, maybe their skin really does feel like an electric sensation, he said.  Any other less common symptoms to watch out for  The World Health Organisationhas compiled a list of less common symptoms. Most are already described in detail in the list above, and one is an official symptom in the UK. The WHO warns people to watch out for the following aposless commonapos symptoms noted worldwide, including: Aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on skin and discolouration of fingers or toes.  The six Covid symptom clusters  Zoe Covid Symptom Study app researchers and Kingaposs College London epidemiologists identied six common clusters of symptoms which could help people feeling unsure. The researchers were able to identy the clusters most commonly linked with mild and severe cases of the illness. The study found that cluster , , or  symptoms tended to be older and frailer and were more likely to be overweight. The sufferers who experienced those symptom clusters tended to have pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or lung disease than those with type , , or  symptoms. Nearly half of the patients in the most severe cluster required hospital support. The study was published in the respected British Medical Journal, and highlighted how most patients who went on to need respiratory support had experienced symptoms about  days before they ended up in hospital. Here are the clusters they identied:. aposFlu-likeapos with no fever Headache, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, no fever.. aposFlu-likeapos with fever Headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss of appetite.

Terri insisted that the DIY will could have been signed by anybody, while there was no reason for her dad to have so completely changed his mind about cutting out her siblings. Handing victory to Terri at the High Court, Judge Matthew Marsh ruled the will was not valid and gave her the right to all her dadaposs cash. During the trial, the court heard car dealer Mr Tibbles, from Tilbury, Essex, had five children, Terri and Paul, and their sisters Susan, Cindy and Kelly, who is Terriaposs identical twin and works in fashion. He was described as a “colourful character” with a habit of leaving large amounts of cash around the house, sometimes stashed in a cornflakes packet, the judge was told. In a letter attached to his first will, dated March , he explained that “his children other than Terri and Paul had been a source of disappointment to him and, while he loved Paul, he did not need the money as much as Terri. In the second will dated days before he died, Paul was named as his dadaposs sole executor and declared that Mr Tibbles “wished his estate to be shared equally between my son and my three daughters: Susan, Cindy and Kelly”. Paul Tibbles, who lives in Ireland where he is manager at a logistics company, claimed his dad validly signed and executed his final will on February ,  - the day before he went into hospital for the last time and five days before he passed away. But suing her brother as executor of the will, model and beautician Terri, who runs the Bella Mai beauty training school in Grays, Essex, dismissed it as a DIY will.  “I don’t accept this document constituted a valid will, she told the judge. “I don’t accept that this document was ever signed by my dad. It would have been totally uncharacteristic for him to prepare a DIY will considering his long history of previous dealings with solicitors.” “The document could just as well have been written and signed by anybody. But Paul Tibbles insisted his sisters Susan, Kelly and Cindy had cared for their father and tended his daily needs during his last months, and claimed his dad had been determined to change his will before he died. He said the second will was valid and cancelled out the earlier one, but missed a deadline for filing documents for the case and so was unable to call evidence at the trial. Giving judgment, Judge Marsh said of the February  will: It’s handwritten and not in Mr Tibbles’ hand writing. It’s written on a sheet of paper which appears to have been torn from a notebook.” The opinion of a handwriting expert who said there was “moderate to strong evidence to show that Mr Tibbles was not responsible for signing the  will” was also powerful evidence against Paul’s case.  It’s plain that there is insufficient evidence to show due execution of the  will, he said. “There’s no evidence placed before me about who wrote the will and whether it was written at Mr Tibbles’ dictation, who was present when that occurred and what his state of mind was at the time. “There’s no real explanation for his change of mind and no evidence about him signing it. “All the evidence and the background circumstances point heavily against the  will being a valid document.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains biggest family radfords 22","story":"NewsBritain’s biggest family The Radfords with  kids show off dining room makeoverMum-of- Sue Radford showed off the familys new pink dining room chairs as work continues to revamp their -bedroom home in Morecambe, LancashiremirrorShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video britains-biggest-family-radfords-show-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The British Medical Association has written to Chief Medical Officer for England Professor Chris Whitty calling for the gap between vaccine doses to be reduced to six weeks. The private letter, seen by the BBC, said the current plans of people waiting up to  weeks for a second dose - which Health Secretary Matt Hancock said is supported by data from an Israeli study - are dficult to justy. It said: The absence of any international support for the UKaposs approach is a cause of deep concern and risks undermining public and the professionaposs trust in the vaccination programme.What do you think  Let us know in the comments belowHowever, Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle has defended the decision, which she said had been taken on public health and scientic advice. The more people that are protected against this virus, the less opportunity it has to get the upper hand. Protecting more people is the right thing to do, she told the BBC Radio  Today programme. People will get their second dose. As supplies become available more people will be vaccinated.  It is a reasonable scientic balance on the basis of both supply and also protecting the most people. It comes after scientists warned Downing Street not to relax lockdown restrictions too soon with the mutated strain potentially more deadly than the first.The first real-world analysis of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine said results fail to show a efficacy at levels close enough to justy delaying a second jab - originally at three weeks in the UK before a Downing Street U-turn. The UKaposs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation previously concluded the first dose delivers  per cent protection from day  after being administered. However, initial data from a study led by Professor Ran Balicer in Israel found it may be as low as  per cent. The Middle Eastern country is currently leading the way with its inoculation programme, having already given one in four people there a jab, with a three-week gap between doses.  Mr Hancock has reportedly been speaking regularly to Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein to “share best practice and to up the pace” of Britain’s rollout. Boris Johnson has appealed to people to stay home and follow the rules after he revealed the new iant may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.He said the Government could have to bring in further restrictions on travel following a warning that other new iants found in South Africa and Brazil may be more resistant to the vaccines that have been developed.  At a sombre No  news briefing on Friday, the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said early evidence suggested the new UK iant could increase mortality by almost a third in men in their s. His warning followed a briefing by scientists on the Governmentaposs New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupwhich concluded there was a realistic possibility that it was associated with an increased risk of death. It was already known that the new iant was up to  per cent more transmissible than the original - leading to a tightening of restrictions across the UK from late December onwards.  Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said the latest findings suggested it was responsible for the unexpectedly high numbers of hospital admissions, especially around London. While the recent results showing declining case numbers is good news, and suggest that the iant is controllable via existing measures, these results on deaths imply that burden in hospitals will continue to be high requiring a more prolonged period of restrictions, he said. Professor Sir Mark Walport, a former government chief scientic adviser and a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said even stricter measures may be neededcases do not continue falling at pace.  Decisions are going to have to be made on the basis of the evidence, he told BBC news. If the evidence shows that the decrease in cases isnapost continuing, then clearly policymakers will have to consider much tougher measures. Mr Johnson said the case numbers remained forbiddingly high and that it would be a mistake to unlock in Englandit were to lead to another big rebound in the disease. On another bleak day, with a further , deaths across the UK of people who had tested for Covid- in the previous  days, there was some good news with evidence the ious lockdown measures in place across the country were having an effect. A sub-group of Sage said the reproduction number, the R, for coronavirus had fallen to below one across the UK, suggesting a retreating epidemic.The Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingput the R, which represents how many people an infected person will pass the virus on to, at . to ., down from . to . the previous week. It said the number of new infections was shrinking by between  per cent and  per cent every day. However Prof Whitty said the situation across the UK remained extremely precarious. A very small change and it could start taking off again from an extremely high base, he said. If that happened again, we would be in really, really deep trouble. Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School, suggested the more serious concern was the evidence that the South African and Brazilian iants may be less susceptible to the vaccines.

And while it is an oval office, it’s not THE Oval Office. But let’s not fret about details as the Sunday Mirror takes you right to the heart of... er, Norfolk... for an exclusive first interview with Mr President. We’re in a replica of the Oval Office, in the backlot of a film studio on the disused RAF Coltishall airfield, north of Norwich. Some , miles east of Washington DC, to be precise. The , sq ft Studio Productions set was built for Watergate, a  US History Channel film by Oscar-winning director Charles Ferguson. The only full-size replica outside of North America, it is used by film-makers and journalists who would find access to the real Oval Office a little trickier. The attention to detail is extraordinary. Everything is to scale – from the desk to the marble fireplace, the artwork replicas, the busts of historical figures. Doorway and window heights are the same, as are the carpets, sofas and flags. The desk is from the Nixon era, as are the soft furnishings. Which probably explains the dferent curtains. Each incoming president gets to redecorate the actual Oval Office, within reason. The carpets change quite often – but must always display the Presidential seal. New sofas will always be a shade of beige and there are six desks in storage for the new incumbent to choose from. smiling And, in Norfolk at least, Biden lookalike Kevin – at  three years younger than the president – looks very much at home. And no wonder he’s smiling – jobbing actor Kevin has become a lot busier as the world’s attention turns to the new man in the Oval Office.  New Yorker Kevin, who has been an extra in The Crown, has spent a lot of time analysing the president. Kevin’s accent appears to be bang-on. And he has mastered Biden’s expressive hand-movements and his calculated speech. He uses the same double Windsor tie knot and is up to speed in politics, explaining: “Quite often at events they want me to speak – so I feel like I do have to honour the real Joe Biden in what I say too. I don’t want to cause some kind of diplomatic incident.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results live saturdays winning","story":"NewsLotto results LIVE: Saturdays winning National Lottery numbers for £.m jackpotA le-changing jackpot of £.million is up for grabs in tonights draw - Saturday, January ,  - so be sure to have your ticket and follow our live blog for the latest updatesmirrorShareByDave BurkeUpdated:,  JAN NewsA whopping £.million double rollover jackpot is up for grabs tonight \" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news lotto-results-live-saturdays-winning- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\" A le-changing sum is up for grabs in tonightaposs National Lottery Lotto draw.A jackpot of £.million could be yoursyou match all six main numbers following a double rollover.

The Boots workeraposs Facebook post on December  read: Evening, my shopping bags were searched in Lidl this evening. I have NEVER in my whole le ever stolen anything! I had a wonderful mum that had taught me a really nice thing in le which was If you canapost afford it, save for it butyou really want it there  then, ask for it but never ever help yourself to someone aposs things! I didnapost feel insulted by the fact that our bags were searched but just a little bit uncomfortable! The sales adviser told me that she had to do that because theyaposve had a lot of mystery shoppers coming in recently! Anyone  experienced this in Lidl recently  Romanian-born Ana said: I went home and I donapost have a family here, so every now and then when I have something that is unclear to me I like to go on our parish page to ask for advice or informing someone orthereaposs an accident and a road closed. So I posted asking for advice as I havenapost experienced like this, I didnapost give any details of the lady who served me, I referred to her as apossheapos rather than a description or a name. Most people were very supportive but there were certain iniduals commenting in a negative way. I wanted to take it further, not to cause harm to the lady at her work but just to gain clarity as to why our bags were searched. I emailed Lidl and they havenapost got back to me.  This week on her first visit back after the post Ana claims she was told not to complain about the shopaposs employees on social media. She says she recorded the exchange in Lidl and has shared it with PlymouthLive, with a transcript at the bottom of this story. Summarising what happened, Ana said: As I was shopping someone approached me out of the blue, didnapost introduce himself, and said aposhi, can you follow me into one of the backrooms so I can have a word with you apos I panicked, I donapost know why. I felt like I had to follow him, but later on I regretted it. I know I couldaposve said no, Iaposm doing my shopping thank you very much. So he took me to the back room and as we were walking I had a recording app on my phone and thought as a way of protecting myself and defending myselfanything happens I turned on the voice recorder. He asks meIaposm aware that thereaposs a customer service line, and am I aware of how things should be done, and I should talk to a member of staff.

The front of two houses crashed into a street the morning after a car was aposswallowedapos by the gaping crater on Walmer Street in Gorton, Manchester.Bernie Scanlon could do nothing but watch as two homes beside hers collapsed, the Manchester Evening News reports. Although her immediate neighbours were evacuated from their houses, Bernie claims she wasnapost told to leave her home, which she says started buckling. The -year-old mum stayed in her house while officials reviewed the row of terraces. But as she nervously waited - trying to gather her possessions in case she had to leave - the home she shares with her son Darren began to crumble around her. She says as the walls were beginning to crack, she grabbed her handbag and ran out. Now the mum fears her home might have to be bulldozed. Itaposs my first home, I worked hard for that. Iaposve been a single parent and Iaposve slogged my guts out to pay that mortgage so I had something to leave the kids, she said. Properties either side - including Bernieaposs - have been left badly damaged. I was inside my house when it started to go, Bernie said. I was inside at the back of my house when I heard the front of the other two houses go. I ran to the front window and they were like aposget out, get out!apos I ran to my front door and couldnapost open it because it had obviously been affected by the collapse, so I ran through the back room.  I was going to throw a few bits in a bag, but then my ceiling started to go. All the plaster started splitting off the walls and I could hear all these cracks. I just had to run out in the clothes Iaposm standing in and my handbag. It was scary. Bernie continued: It was a split-second decision to leave. I thought apos I donapost get out now, Iaposm not getting outapos. I ran out of my back gate and people were there saying aposoh, here she isapos, so they must have been waiting for me to come out. Within minutes, my house started to split, the masonry split, the walls separated from the window. Weaposve lost everything, me and my son. If we canapost get back in to get a few bits, weaposve got nothing. Bernie says she got out of her home aposwith minutes to spareapos.  She added: When the sinkhole happened on Wednesday night, there was a lot of activity going on - firefighters, United Utilities, what looked like a few council workers there, but I wasnapost too sure. The back end of the car ended up in the sinkhole, it was full of water. It took them hours to move the car, never mind coming to start draining the water. All throughout the night, they were drilling and digging, whatever . Quarter past seven on Thursday morning, it all stopped. Thataposs around when my son got up for work. Heaposd usually get up at am, but he left it a bit later because heaposd had no sleep. Thataposs when he noticed our house had got much worse. There was a crack at the top of the right-hand corner of his bedroom leading to his window sill and it was the same in my living room. At about -ish, I came outside and we could see that the pavement had dipped even more. While I was standing there, a man nearly got buried under a ton of rubble, one of the gateposts went while he was standing there. I went back in and I started to sort stuff out in case we needed to go. But not long after that, I heard the house start to go. That was about -ish.  As I got out of the house, the plinth above my window split, the glass went through, the masonry sagged a bit more. I literally got out with minutes to spare. Miraculously, nobody was hurt. Police and fire crews attended on Thursday morning, before United Utilities engineers were called in. They initially said they were dealing with a aposcollapsed sewerapos. The company say aposit is not known what caused the sinkholeapos. An investigation is ongoing. It is now believed the sewer has been left badly damaged, but has not collapsed. The mother and son were left wondering where they would sleep that night. They say they were aposleft in the darkapos for hours, but the M.E.N. has been told United Utilities later provided them with acommodation. Itaposs traumatic enough losing everything youaposve got, watching your house falling down, she added. Nearly  years weaposve been in that house. In total,  homes were evacuated, with residents being moved into hotel accommodation.  All hard-working Bernie has been left with are the memories over more than two decades spent in a home which might have to be demolished. I have lots of memories in that house - all my photos, all my mumaposs stuff. Iaposm not bothered about clothes, TVs, they can be replaced. Itaposs the sentimental stuff. Itaposs everything. All my personal things. Itaposs my le. Iaposve literally run out of the house in what Iaposve got on and my handbag. It was my first home, I worked hard for that, Iaposve been a single parent and Iaposve slogged my guts out to pay that mortgage so I had something to leave the kids.I finished work three years ago because of spinal problems, Iaposve got arthritis everywhere. My doctor told me that my body was telling me to give up.I was in retail, Iaposve been a renal clinical support worker, Iaposve been an accountant, I managed a business for  years - Iaposve done a few jobs to make it work. Itaposs a real sad day to see it all end like this - I was crying at the sight of it. It came after a particularly dficult year for the mother and son. Bernie said: I havenapost got any insurance. My son was put out of work because of Covid- and I had to cancel it because I couldnapost afford it, I was keeping him. He was self-employed and he couldnapost get any help. Right at the start of lockdown, he was working construction but contracts were lost, the whole team had to go. All last year, I had to take care of him because he had no work, it was really hard. It was very hard to string out the money.  Last year was a nightmare, this yearaposs starting off nice, isnapost it  Weaposre all in the same boat. Weaposve got some good neighbours, good community spirit there. It was our neighbours that have been bringing us cups of tea, the chippy man came and saidweaposre hungry he can sort us out. At least Iaposm still here, I could have been stuck inside. At least no one has been hurt, thataposs the main thing. A spokesperson for United Utilities said: The evacuations were managed by the Fire Service with Manchester City Council Buildings Control engineers. Four houses were evacuated on Wednesday night and a further  on Thursday as the situation developed.

When Lauren Orme moved into the Walton property four years ago it had dark outdated décor and ugly carpets, so she resolved to spruce it up.With paint, up-cycling and bargain hunting on eBay, Amazon and BM, Lauren, , has produced a fantastic looking home on a shoestring budget. She documented her work on the Instagram account @the_liverpool_house, to inspire other to do the same without blowing the bank. Would you renovate your own house  Let us know in the comments below. Lauren told the Echo : The majority of Instagram accounts I follow are amazing houses and people who are spending a lot of money and putting a lot of work into their houses - but not everyone can afford that.People like me who rent canapost rip someone aposs kitchen out, certainly not on my budget anyway. We didnapost really want to be spending too much money on something thataposs not really ours in the long term. But I wanted to put my own stamp on it and change things as much as we could. I wanted to show people who canapost afford all that expensive stuff that you can make things more your own. Obviously ask your landlord for permission first, but you can do lots of small cosmetic jobs, you donapost have to do a great big renovation.  Recalling when she first moved into the house, she said: It was OK, it was just dated and there were ugly brown carpets everywhere. Everything was dark colours - browns and blacks and the walls were grey. I wanted it to feel a bit Scandinavian and like a country cottage. It was really dark and I wanted it the opposite - light and bright. I did the living room first as thataposs probably where we spend the most time.  Lauren used sticky back plastic from Amazon to change the design of the fireplace, giving it a marble effect. Using wood  from underneath a bed upstairs and some leftover ribbon, she constructed shelves on either side of the fireplace. The cost of the living room came to £, including the cost of paint.But the most remarkable transformation is the kitchen, which cost around £. Before and after shots show how much it has changed, from black tiles and worktops to a light modern interior. Lauren said: Itaposs a kitchen diner in an L shape but the kitchen part is only about two metres wide.  I always wanted a breakfast bar but I didnapost know how I could achieve that in such a strange space. With a piece of wood, metal from BQ and dining chairs, she made a makesht breakfast bar and fixed it to the wall. She added: Itaposs not a proper breakfast bar with high stools but it doesnapost have to be. It can be whatever you want it to be.  Itaposs great when you walk in and think aposI did all of this by myselfapos. With the help of the stick back plastic from Amazon, she covered the kitchen worktops with a new pattern and used stickers to create vintage tiles. She also found photo frames, chairs and accessories from discount stores like BM and Poundland.

But Jenner Spencer took her own le aged just  after seeking enlightenment by trying mind-bending drugs and practising Kundalini yoga. Her tragic death at Beachy Head has prompted a coroner to issue an urgent alert to NHS England bosses over the drugs – and her yoga regime. Jenny died months after drinking psychoactive brew ayahuasca in Peru. A banned Class A substance here, it is regarded as traditional plant-based medicine in parts of South America and popular with backpackers. At the inquest, East Sussex assistant coroner James Healy-Pratt said Jenny’s “mental health deteriorated following ingestion of ­shamanic hallucinogenic drugs and Kundalini yoga.” It is believed to be the first time British authorities have named Kundalini yoga – practised drug-free by stars such as Demi Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow – in the circumstances of a death. The coroner said narcotics like ­ayahuasca were “becoming more commonplace” in the UK but there was a lack of awareness among mental health experts about them “and their propensity to cause or exacerbate psychosis”. Jenny’s shattered family praised him for highlighting the issues. Her aunt Fiona Chase, , said Jenny had no known mental health problems before drinking the drug while on holiday in Peru with her “healer” boyfriend seven months before she died. Fiona said her niece fell into a “sort of psychosis” after practising Kundalini, said to awaken awareness through guided deep breathing, mantras and movements. She said: “Jenny was always a very ­spiritual. If there was an opportunity to go to a retreat she’d do it.” Before Peru, Jenny was a very intelligent, outgoing, loving, generous person, said Fiona. “Whether it was the ayahuasca in Peru or the experience of Kundalini – it provoked something in her. It was a perfect storm, everything came together.” Reports claim some followers of Kundalini can experience psychotic symptoms and, in some cases, a permanently altered state due to the raw emotion it unleashes. Fiona recalled Jenny having a bad experience after a two-hour then a three-hour class. “After that she had all sorts of beliefs,” Fiona said. “She believed her brain had split in two. She believed she had perception and could read people’s thoughts. It was a sort of psychosis, paranoia. She was really scared.”  Jenny’s worsening mental health saw her leave her flatshare in London and move in with her mother in Kent. Jenny is believed to have attended spiritual retreats with boyfriend Bradley Reeder, , who describes himself as “an authentic practitioner and lineage holder of the shamanic ­traditions of Peru”. They travelled to Peru in April  but they split that July. Bradley denied the use of shamanic drugs led to her death, claiming she had mental health problems before the trip. He said: “I didn’t really want her to drink [the brew]. But she insisted. I said to the shaman, ‘Please don’t give her very much, I don’t think it’s a good idea’. She had a small amount and she was fine. There was no change in her behaviour before and after Peru. “A month after we came back she got fired from her job. In the months afterwards, her mental health deteriorated. She just wasn’t sleeping or eating. All of this built up and eventually erupted in the psychosis.” Fiona, of Andover, Hants, said Jenny “may have” also taken ayahuasca in the UK, and says she took mugwort, a plant found here, said to be hallucinogenic. She continued: “I don’t know how Jenny got into Kundalini but it’s there, it’s available. I’ve done it myself.” Fiona said Jenny had made a suicide attempt in the weeks before her death but appeared in “a good mood” on the day in November  when she suggested a walk on Beachy Head in East Sussex with her father. Fiona said: “They were walking along and she ran off the top. Whether it was an impromptu or it had been in her mind, we don’t know. It’s just awful.” Jenner’s family want regulatory ­bodies for shaman and Kundalini ­practitioners. Fiona said: “People need to be aware these things can lead to dangerous experiences.”  In , a coroner called for more guidance over the use of hallucinogenic drugs in tribal rituals after Henry Miller, , from Bristol, was found dead in Colombia. He drank a brew during a shamanic ceremony in  and died of intoxication of yageand a related drug known as scopolamine. Kary Preetam, of the Kundalini Yoga Teachers Association representing  certied instructors, denied the practice can be “dangerous” but stressed the importance of using a proper teacher. She said of Jenny: “That’s a very sad story. There’s a conversation to be had about mixing practices. When mixing ayahuasca and going through strong practice, it’s a lot for the body to take.” Mr Healy-Pratt has given NHS bosses until February  to outline planned action or explain why none is proposed. Brew gave BBC man flashback TV documentary maker Bruce Parry was filmed taking part in an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru for BBC series Tribe in . It showed him vomiting, or “purging”, said to be vital to the process. He described having had flashbacks of repressed memories on his “trip”. Indigenous to South America, the mind-bending brew is made from ayahuasca, or “vine of the dead”, and several herbs and shrub containing DMT, a hallucinogenic substance.

Body-cam footage showing the incident last Saturday evening , was released by Gwent Police as the constabulary warned breaching restrictions is dangerous, selfish, and...totally unacceptable.Once inside the property in Rhymney, Caerphilly, the officer finds three households-worth of people and tells them a fine will be posted out, reports WalesOnline.

The woman also refuses to give her name and claims everyone inside is part of one bubble. Under current lockdown rules in Wales and England, a person living on their own can create a support bubble with only one other household.  The officer tells the occupants he doesnapost necessarily need to take the matter further but they continue to be dficult. When one shouts over him, he explains that a fine will be delivered to the house anditaposs not paid it will lead to court action.Last weekend a total of  people were fined by Gwent Police for breaching coronavirus regulations, including holding house parties. Officers attended house parties in Pontypool, Newport and Rhymney – behaviour which has been condemned. Chief superintendent Mark Hobrough said: “Alert level four restrictions are still in place in Wales which means that people should remain in their own household and only travel when necessary. House parties and any mixing of households, both indoors and outdoors, is prohibited by Welsh Government regulations.  Organising parties and gatherings is dangerous, selfish, and is totally unacceptable in light of the current threat we face.

Pictured for the first time, David Rodgers refused to talk about the royal, his paedophile financier pal or any of the victims who claim they were abused. When tracked down by the Mirror in Lake Worth, Florida, the -year-old airman said: “I can’t talk.” He claims Andrew flew at least  times on the billionaire’s jet – allegations that have thrust Andrew into the FBI investigation into Epstein. The Prince has categorically denied ever meeting Giuffre, who claims he had sex with her four times when she was . But Rodgers’ logs provide the most detailed independent testimony to the courts about Andrew’s friendship with the paedophile, placing pressure on the dad-of-two to speak to the FBI.The Mirror found the pilot living close to the Florida airport from which Epstein flew his victims. His wall of silence mirrors that of other pilots who ferried Epstein and his alleged madam ­Ghislaine Maxwell, . Rodgers’ LinkedIn profile still lists him as an employee of Epstein NES LLC company. Between  until  he wrote an entry on the flight manests for each trip he flew for the pervert, who killed himself in prison in . Andrew, , has denied “being good friends” with Epstein. But Rodgers’ flight manests claim to show him at all four locations where the billionaire had homes, including Florida and his private US Virgin Island, Little St James. He also flew Giuffre, now , to London in March , where she claims she first had sex with the Duke.A source said: “David has complied with the FBI and others investigating those who enabled Jeffrey’s offending. He was trusted with his most prized and high-profile friends not only the Prince but Bill Clinton too. “He is adamant he didn’t see any wrongdoing as he flew Epstein, his cronies and the girls around.” Andrew’s first flights on Epstein’s old jet, a ­Gulfstream, were logged in February . In May the following year, he took a trip from New York to Florida with the American tycoon and others. On March ,  Rodgers claims he flew the Duke and Giuffre from New Mexico to Florida. According to court circulars, Andrew had an evening engagement in London on March , , and one on April  .

Joe Biden, , got quite a few as well…but the leader of the free world was sharing his big day with another American icon. Dolly Parton, the First Lady of country music, was turning , and millions of fans were lining up to wish her Happy Birthday. But, typically, the musician and philanthropistchose to focus on others, and issued “a call for kindness”. “We can’t just hope for a brighter day, we have to work for a brighter day,” she wrote. “Love too often gets buried in a world of hurt and fear…let’s get to unearthing love.” Her words could have slotted straight into President Biden’s inaugural address, as he urged Americans to end their “uncivil war”, start lending each other a hand and opening their hearts. Because Biden and Parton are cut from the same cloth. He may not have the lacquered wigs and the dazzling rhinestone sparkle, but he has her strong mind and big shining heart. They share an innate decency – a work ethic and homespun wisdom forged in a close, loving family. And both have a passion for education, social ­justice and equality. Dolly doesn’t “do politics” though. Her views and values may shine through her lyrics and witty “Dollyisms” but she’s far too savvy to risk upsetting half her followers by coming out as Republican or Democrat. She belongs to all her fans, just as Joe believes he belongs to, and serves, all Americans. I have no ideahe is a fan of hers orhe’d appreciate my comparisons. But, as he battles the legacy of fake news and the , lies his predecessor told while in office, he could take comfort in her wise words. My favourite Dolly song is about a dumped woman who copes with her heartache by imagining a world in ­reverse… “rivers flow backwards, valleys are high, mountains are level and truth is a lie”.

Michelle, , only shops using food vouchers as she and her husband rely on one household wage - saving a huge sum.The mum-of-two, from the US, told shopping channel TLC about her thrty spending habits in a YouTube video.She said: I hate full price. It needs to be with a coupon or on clearance. Michelle also saves some pennies by growing her own vegetables and tending to her own chicken coup for eggs.What do you think of Michelleaposs efforts  Let us know in the comments below. And she has a massive stockpile cupboardwhere she hoards , food items when buying a bulk - a key trick of the trade. But itaposs the coupons which really bring the price down - with the mum showing she can slash her bill to almost nothing. Michelle said she hopes to use the savings, which she tracks on a spreadsheet, to buy a new family home. She said: Iaposll cut my coupons out, Iaposll organise them and then I get my spreadsheet with all the items that are on sale and match with my coupons and I print them out and take it to the store.  While her current system has worked so far, Michelle decided to challenge herself to spend just on her usual shop. Clutching her giant folder of , coupons, the mum went to her local supermarket - and came away with an impressive haul. Michelle bought many items in bulk, including  bags of brown rice, normally costing .a pack, for just c , knocking a dollaroff per item. She also picked up  batches of husband Coryaposs favourite coffee drink for free, with coupons covering the full cost of the item.Michelle said she will often price-matchother supermarkets have the items for cheaper so the coupon deal will be based on the lower price - saving more money. But she admitted that this level of organisation takes some effort - which is why she has the spreadsheet - and said she has to work hard for some of the deals. The video also shows Michelle asking to process the items as three separate transactions when she gets to the checkout so that she can use as many coupons as possible.  The first bill comes to a total of .- which is then knocked down to . . The second lot cost  , down to around - meaning sheaposd gone over her budget. All three transactions totalled around  , down hugely from  . But Michelle was desperate to find a way to make it even cheaper so inspected the receipts of the first two shops - and realised there had been a mistake with the added tax.

The mum had noticed the buttons on the machine appeared to be slowly wearing away and had finally given up - but when she inspected it further, she realised she had simply never taken the protective plastic off five years ago.She shared a photo of the blunder on Facebook, and wrote: For years, I thought the buttons were wearing. Turns out I never took the plastic off. On the plus side, brand-new looking microwave. Many people resonated with the post as it gained more than , reactions in a few hours, with one person coming forward to admit that the problem had rang a bell, and they discovered they had overlooked the same issue,reports.They wrote: Just realised I have the exact same microwave and was experiencing the same issues with the buttons. I just went and checked and yes I hadn’t taken the plastic off either. A second commented to say: I found mine after three years. I was about to get cranky at the kids because it was gross after I had wiped it over and looked like the start button was melting.

Minor injuries had kept them out of the Scottish Cup clash with Bonnyrigg Rose.The Lichties, meanwhile, made three changes from the team that drew at Queen of the South with Ricky Little, Michael Ruth and Scott Stewart coming in. That saw Mark Whatley and Jake Davidson drop to the bench while there was no Kris Doolan.Former Dees Bobby Linn and Gavin Swankie were also substitutes.The temperature may have been dropping but conditions were perfect for a January night in Arbroath.And the visitors wasted no time in making themselves at home as they took the lead within seven minutes.A Jordan Marshall cross into striker Osman Sow bounced up off Lichties skipper Tam O#Brien#s arm and referee Greg Aitken pointed to the spot. Charlie Adam stepped up and made no mistake from  yards, firing into the top corner.The night was over early for the ing McGhee as he went off with a shoulder injury after just  minutes, Cammy Kerr replacing him in central midfield.On  minutes, the home side threatened but Scott Stewart couldn#t get a toe on a loose ball in the area to beat Jack Hamilton in the Dundee goal.Five minutes later and it should have been - as the Dark Blues broke at pace. Adam played Danny Mullen in behind but he saw his finish crash off the crossbar and over.Arbroath were having plenty of the ball but the visitors were creating the better opportunities.Five minutes before the break, Dundee suffered another injury as Mullen limped off to be replaced by Jonathan Afolabi.Into first-half stoppage time and this time the Dark Blues were denied by home goalie Derek Gaston as Osman Sow#s low effort came back out off the keeper#s feet.Nine minutes after the break Dundee had a third enforced substitution as central defender Liam Fontaine limped off with Jordon Forster on in his place.Dick Campbell then threw on Linn as the home side went in search of an equaliser and it was his corner that earned it as Little rose highest to head beyond Hamilton on  minutes.The points were there for the taking for either team and next it was Arbroath#s turn to go for the lead as Dale Hilson broke in behind the Dundee defence but saw Hamilton beat out his effort from wide.And it was the home side looking more likely to grab the all-important third goal with Linn missing a decent opportunity as time ticked away.The Dark Blues tested the home defence with a succession of free-kicks in the closing stages but the Red Lichties held firm with O’Brien on hand to knock an Adam corner off the line in stoppage time.It was to be a point apiece as the referee brought an end to a hard-fought Friday night contest.Arbroath: Gaston, Thomson, Hamilton, Little, O#Brien, Gold , Williamson, Craigen , Hilson, Ruth, Stewart .Subs not used: Whatley, Swankie, Davidson, Gallacher.Dundee: Hamilton, Elliott, Fontaine , Ashcroft, Marshall, Byrne, McGhee , Adam, McGowan, Mullen , Sow.Subs not used: Robertson, Anderson, Cameron, Legzdins.Referee: Greg Aitken.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/25macsp_Sturgeon_10486305-e1611323014391-940x564.jpg ","title":"bute house nicola sturgeon defends essential ceiling repairs","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has insisted work carried out at Bute House was #essential# for safety reasons and that she has not been there for months.The first minister defended the ceiling repairs at her official residence in Edinburgh after it was revealed that workers visited the property during lockdown last week.Opposition MSPs had described the renovations as a #slap in the face# to ordinary Scots who are adhering to restrictions designed to halt the spread of coronavirus.However, when asked about the upgrade at her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the impression given by the story was “not accurate”.She said: “The reason it is important to address it is that I know and understand that nothing infuriates people right now more than the sense that there is one law for everybody and somehow another law for people like me.“I think there is a couple of points just to make to clary the Bute House issue.“Firstly, I’m not staying in Bute House just now.#I haven’t set foot in Bute House since the first lockdown, because back then I decided to minimise the number of staff that were having to be in Bute House, and to cut my own contacts as much as possible, I was going to be staying in my own home.“And that’s what I’ve been doing since the first lockdown.

The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

The Exchequer Roll of  reads: ldquoTo Brother John Cor,  bolls of malt, wherewith to make aqua vitae for the King. Eight bolls of malt would be enough to make approximately  bottles of whisky, so production was clearly continuing apace at Lindores Abbey.Today, a mere  years after the Kingrsquos order, whisky is once again flowing at its spiritual home. Lindores Abbey Distillery, situated outside Newburgh, Fe, opened in  following years of campaigning and fundraising work by the Abbeyrsquos custodians, Drew and Helen McKenzie Smith.

I stress again, itrsquos nothing to do with whether you like wind farms or whether you donrsquot, itrsquos all about being in a position to benefit from themthey happen.Mr Bruce said both EDF and Fred Olsen Renewables, both anticipate putting in planning application around spring time.Tweeddale councillor Heather Anderson said there are ldquosensitivities regarding the history of plans for the wind farm near Eddleston.She said: ldquoThere have been campaigns against Cloich and the proposals were re-designed.ldquoFor many of us living around here theyrsquore worse. So yes, therersquos sometimes community benefit money but the impact on the environment is also signicant, and Irsquom saying that as someone who is completely pro-wind farms.Mr Bruce replied: ldquoFor me itrsquos not about whether the wind farm goes ahead or not, itrsquos about being in a position to benefit from any fund that comes along. Thatrsquos all Irsquom doing ndash Irsquom not commenting on the pluses or minuses for the wind farms themselves."},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-kingsmeadows-house-land-eyed-build-plans","story":"A HOUSING company is set to announce plans for a new major development in Peebles.Granton Homes has given notice to Scottish Borders Councilthat it intends to submit a planning application to build residential properties within the grounds of Kingsmeadows House.Last year, the company pulled its plans to erect seven houses on a disused bowling green and tennis court at the site, following public objection.: Confirmed: Great Tapestry to be kept in display cabinets costing pound,At the time, SBC planning officer Ranald Dods said that particular proposal would be \"detrimental to the woodland resource, the setting of the listed building and the character and appearance of the conservation area and not be acceptable on road safety grounds\".A consultation will take place once the full details of the new plans have been announced.The form sent to the council refers to the \"erection of [a] residential development and associated works \".Granton Homes bought the Grade B-listed Georgian mansion and its grounds in ."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-new-cases-borders-shown-official-figures","story":"#THE Borders has recorded  new cases of coronavirus in the last  hours, according to Scottish Government statistics.Figures published at pm todayshow that the region has now recorded , cases of COVID-since March last year.There are now  people with coronavirus in hospital, with seven in the intensive care unit .

They race out of their cars to help people load shopping into the boot, or help elderly people into the car, and often carry the heavy bags to customers# homes.Taxi drivers are a leline for elderly people all across the country and I hope ours know that we notice all the little things they do to go the extra mile.Name and address supplied.The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will, for the first time, intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory Government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for mokrun 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

At this stage, these are dficult negotiations but I am deeply committed to this plant and I am going to strain every sinew to save these jobs, not for the first time but for a second time. I am hopeful that it can be done.’He added: ‘I have been personally in touch with potential buyers of the Machrihanish factory. I know the area and I think it is a great plant with a great future and a fine workforce and these are great assets for a potential buyer.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOCall for media campaign to launch ferryThe vice-chairman of the new Argyll and Bute Council planning, development and tourism committee is calling for a major public relations drive in Ireland to support the launch of the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.Councillor David Webster said the service should be marketed as a new ‘gateway to Scotland’ in Irish newspapers, and on television and radio.He told the Courier that he believed the creation of the new council offered a ‘never to be repeated’ opportunity to put Argyll and Bute back on the tourism map.Mr Webster called for the creation of four local marketing groups, including one for Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay, to bring together councillors and trade representatives.Mr Webster also wants more done to persuade television companies and film makers to use locations in Argyll and Bute, more done to attract business conferences to the area and better facilities for sailing.He is also suggesting persuading ship operators to offer week-long cruises in Argyll and Bute similar to ones run in Norway.Mr Webster said: ‘Argyll and Bute is on the threshold of a boom in tourism and economic development, but onlythe council takes and maintains a lead in promotion, publicity and development, albeit in co-operation with Argyll and the Islands Enterprise and the new area tourist board.’FIFTY YEARS AGOPiped TV charges to be raisedWeekly piped television charges are to be increased at the beginning of April from s d to s d. Redfusion Ltd announced this week in a letter to Campbeltown Town Council about the service in the town.Mr CM Payne, general manger of Redfusion in Scotland, states that the increase is made necessary by the #uneconomic nature# of the operation to #duplicate# the network to allow for provision of BBC, BBC and STV colour television on the relay.Mr Payne writes that the Redfusion board of directors accepted his recommendation to proceed with the necessary engineering works.Of the increased charges to subscribers, Mr Payne writes: #We are naturally concerned in having to take this step, but as I mentioned above, the service is presently uneconomic, and in order to bring the network up to a standard capable of distributing at least thee colour programmes on -lines standard as well as the -lines standard transmissions, we shall require to spend a large sum of money.’ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesMr Duncan Macdougall Snr has given up the local agency for Singer’s Sewing Machines, which he has held for  years, and is being succeeded by his son Mr D Macdougall Jnr.Visitors of Campbeltown Poultry Show had a tangible reminder that #oor birds# have much more than local fame by seeing on view the Larkhall Jubilee Silver Cup, a handsome trophy, valued at  guineas, which was won by Kilkerran greys at Larkhall’s great jubilee event.The local Ne’erday ‘Marathon’ Jock v Geeke came off in the Showfield at half-time during the match between Drumlemble and Hearts.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome. Once I qualied, I went around a bit, to Africa, west and east, and the West Indies, but Jura was better than anywhere I went. I hope the people of Jura see this.Leslie McArthur, Carluke, South Lanarkshire.I have contacted our roads department about the icy and, at times, ungritted pavements in my council ward.Many of my justiably concerned constituents have been in regular contact with me on this matter.With all that is going on, whether it#s the latest lockdown or a decreasing local authority budget, our hard-working roads workers are thinly stretched and do not have an easy task. However, when it comes to our pavements and roads, safety must always come first.Our pavements must be safe to walk on all year round.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands.The Scottish Government spin machine’s use of phrases last week like #encouraging progress# about the works at the Rest and Be Thankful cannot disguise its failure to make any real progress towards a solution.At an online briefing session last month, I questioned Transport Minister Michael Matheson on why it says it could take at least five years before it even starts work on a proper solution.He waffled on about planning permission, environmental impact assessments and compensating landowners. This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America.

I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"glen scotia raises a glass to entrepreneurial partnership","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"woodland initiative takes root at homeston","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Fights between males can be violent and sometimes lead to serious injury or death.No matter how tempting it is for a photographer to capture battling deer, it is also incredibly dangerous to come anywhere near these animals during their breeding season.At this time of the year, bucks are aggressive and can pose a danger to human le.It is important not to approach these animals but to watch them from the distance and safety of a vehicle.It is also important not to disturb them at this crucial point in time.In this season, it is vital for deer to be able to showcase their natural behaviour without any disturbance.Aftermating, bucks shed their antlers in October and begin to grow a new set.Young roe deerare born in May and June and stay with their mothers for about  months.This year, I would be particularly delighted to capture fawns on camera as I, like many others, find these animals an appealing subject.Another interesting aspect that I would like to capture in my photos is the colour of the deerrsquos coat, which changes throughout the year.Summer time is when their coat is most distinguishable and turns a bright rusty red colour, while in winter it is dull, almost grey.If you regularly watch roe deer or know their location and could help gather images, I would like to hear from you!Speak to you next month.www.facebook zanslens www.instagram zans_lens www zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-election-2021-three-candidates-far-midlothian-north-musselburgh","story":"Sitting MSP Colin Beattie, SNP, is seeking re-election Labourrsquos choice to fight the seat is Midlothian councillor Stevie Curran and representing the Scottish Conservatives is City of Edinburgh councillor Iain Whyte.The Liberal Democrats said that their selection process was ongoing and the Scottish Greens are not fielding a candidate for the Midlothian North  Musselburgh seat.Mr Beattie said he was ldquoproud to have served the people of Midlothian North and Musselburgh for the past  years.He said: ldquoDuring this time, I have helped so many people in many dferent ways.ldquoThese are not easy times for any of us, with dficult decisions being made for the protection of us all.ldquoThere is no doubt that some decisions have caused real problems for businesses and iniduals ndash but, as Covid- has been spreading rapidly, there has been no alternative.ldquoI have reached out to many businesses across the constituency offering support to protect jobs.He added: ldquoPeople have asked what my priorities would beI was re-elected.

Nobody, from the First Minister to the Scottish Football Association, escaped his wrath. Not even the breaking news that another team member had tested positive derailed his self-righteous fury. Theirs, he said, was an entirely legitimate and well-run exercise. The furore, he said, was ldquoall political.Maybe it was in some quarters, but for the general public ndash those who have never heard of Mo Salah or Harry Kane let alone Scott Brown ndash to see sportsmen heading for the sun at a time of national crisis was astonishing. It starkly reinforced the fact that footballers are an elite for whom the rules are stretched or revised wherever possible. Indeed, the sporting top tier appears to live in a bubble of its own, but not the Covid kind. Just like Novak Djokovic, complaining about having to quarantine in a Melbourne hotel room, these star performers believe they are invincible, that their status and acclaim protects them from criticism, challenge or, indeed, infection.: Vaccinate supermarket staffTo be fair, the scenes of Celtic on their day off by the Dubai poolside were not as shocking as those from the autumn, when the Scottish squad celebrated its Euro  play-off success. In jubilation, they danced a congo like six-year-olds at a party. Since then, viewers of the Premier League have weekly witnessed footage of high-profile players ndash and in Europe ndash cuddling and canoodling after every goal and victory. Despite dire levels of British infection, the idea of taking a firebreak pause this season was deemed unthinkable.Celticrsquos miscalculation was to jet off just at the point when everyone  had to hunker down. Their trip might not technically have broken any law, but nor did it uphold the spirit of the times. While they were enjoying sunshine on their backs, ordinary mortals were facing a grim endurance test, and hospitals filling with the sick and dying. As Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly urged, testing the limit of whatrsquos allowable is in nobodyrsquos interests. We should be trying to do as little as possible, not as much. Heading to Dubai certainly falls into the category of pushing the envelope, as does much of the sportrsquos behaviour in recent weeks.Lennonrsquos lack of remorse is not surprising. Across the board there is a sense of entitlement about the football world. It is treated so reverentially yoursquod be forgiven for assuming it was sacred. While other industries and activities are mothballed until the pandemic is under control, football has been designated a special case. Getting the game back on the pitch has been viewed as an urgent priority, asthe countryrsquos mental health depends upon it. The mere thought of a match makes everyone happy, or so we are told, although clearly that is nonsense. Where I live, Scotland could be playing in the World Cup final, yet few would be glued to their screens. Rugby is an entirely dferent matter, streets empty during the Calcutta Cup.So when did football become a barometer of national well-being  To a degree all sport is for the wider good, but nothing beats football for the privilege and leeway allowed, in the name of boosting morale. It seems to be universally accepted that without the chance to cheer on their side, fans would go bonkers with boredom and misery. While some see the vaccine as light at end of the tunnel, for a clubrsquos supporters, watching their side emerge from the tunnel is the stuff of miracles.I admit, it does feel like a semblance of normality to hear match commentaries on the radio on a Saturday afternoon. For the first half hour I even enjoyed the David and Goliath clash that was Marine v Spurs. Yet while top players are meant to be role models for young men in respect of Covid etiquette, many set a poor example.

Meanwhile, other players earning tens of thousands of pounds each week sit idle on the bench, like thoroughbreds confined to the stable.Despite the rise in the womenrsquos game, and a growing number of female fans, football remains a minority and mainly male interest. Almost as many folk attend church as games. Going to the cinema or theatre, listening to live country, blues or classical music or poetry readings, are minority interests too. All of these and countless other art forms and activities are as vital to our sanity as the sight of a penalty shootout.In Scotland, the so-called beautul game is a boring two-horse race: Rangers v Celtic . As Celtic might eventually learn, own goals come in many forms.

I think, you know, its quite nice to remember that in the midst of all the bleakness.\"A combination of physical comedy and an altogether softer approach to Cowards original sharp, quick-witted exchanges, the film sees Madame Arcati conjure the spirit of Charles first we, Elvira, resulting in an ensuing love triangle from beyond the grave.\"Youve got a group of us really sat around essentially watching Judi do her thing - we have a couple of interjections, but its really the Madame Arcati show at that moment, quite literally,\" adds Stevens of shooting the films seance scenes.\"There are all sorts of effects going on and its a long old scene.\"But great fun, you know. Just a very silly gang, sat around a table with Judi Dench doing her incredible work, its a pretty great day at the office.\"First opening in the West End in , the original production was subsequently transferred to the big screen courtesy of David Lean and his  adaptation.By todays standards, the premise of two wives quarrelling over their husband might be considered a little outdated as a concept.However, the script boasts a warm and nostalgic undercurrent which, paired with the films period setting, provides some suitably comedic respite in the midst of an otherwise bleak January.\"It had all the right notes that made me want to do it, really,\" says Stevens.\"And also, it was my first time trying to do Coward on screen, which not a lot of people have tried to do to be honest and it hasnt always been done successfully.\"There was a lovely circularity to this project, in that my first West End job was in Noel Cowards Hay Fever with Judi Dench, directed by Sir Peter Hall.\"I started out in his theatre company and its his son, Ed Hall, who came to me with this really lovely adaptation.\"As the tit-for-tat storyline unravels, Charles current we, Ruth, finds herself increasingly jealous of Elvira, a woman only her husband can see.Equal parts talented and manipulative, Manns ghostly character is something of a wind-up merchant when it comes to subtly taunting her living counterpart - a trait that captured the attention of Mann from the outset.\"I was thrilled to be asked to join in - I was asked kind of late in the game, I think someone  dropped out,\" laughs Mann, .\"To be able to completely let loose and be this big character - Ive never done that before.\"To just carry myself the way that she carries herself.

I strongly believe we shouldnrsquot over-sanitise situations for our readers, who are, after all, intelligent iniduals with good ability to reason what is right and wrong in the world we live in. That being said, it is important for me to bear in mind that we have no way of warning readers in advance of the pictures we are putting before them.A case in point would be that of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian refugee who was washed up on a beach near Bodrum, Turkey, and was photographed face down in the water with his mother and other members of his family. The wire feeds carried a powerful and distressing set of images which to this day makes me emotional.This was too important a story to ignore photographically we chose to give front-page treatment to an image of a police officer carrying little Alanrsquos leless body up the bench in a tender, gentle manner. This illustrated the heartbreak of the situation and how it called to our common humanity. Other news outlets chose to run with images of the boy in the water.

Hamilton was really the thing that allowed people to have a little bit of putting a name with a face, and I just felt like I can be myself a little bit.\"Because when you start out, people are like Youre the next Denzel! or Youre not quite Denzel enough, or Youre the next Don Cheadle, Youre not quite Don Cheadle enough, and so for the first time I felt people were letting me be the very best version of Leslie Odom Jr, so why would I try to be a terrible Sam Cooke \"But it was Kemp Powers script that really won me over, he was trying to do something daring in this movie and I knew that Regina was the one to lead the way.\"British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir, who plays Malcolm X, also felt nervous to take on his part, but was determined that King would never know.\"I wanted to present her with my own version of fearlessness,\" he says, \"because I didnt want her to feel at any stage that the person she was employing to play Malcolm X was cautious or unsure, even though the Malcom in this film required such a huge vulnerability.\"EvenI was frightened, I was fronting to Regina that I was super-confident.

After all I am the only customer in here.Yes, that guy behind the counter in an all-white outfit with a Joe  cap is a study in goddam perpetual motion. Banking that glowing charcoal on the open grill, twisting skewers after skewer of carmelising meat, popping balls of dough to be palm flattened into pide then fired into the oven beside, flipping lids on salads, wrapping and bagging orders.And all the time carrying out a non-stop conversation with another guy hanging over the end of the counter who I at first take to be a delivery driver: Canrsquot be as they donrsquot do deliveries.Then itrsquos definitely just me: the invisible fat man. Letrsquos just say there ainrsquot any eye contact whatsoever, in any shape or style, coming my way for a excruciatingly long time.

Hey, the Istanbul has never been speedy but thatrsquos been on the wholly acceptable grounds that everything right down to those pita-like pides, the long, pillowy dough of the lahmacun, the very meat itself is properly cooked to order.And thatrsquos why this place is culinary gold.We get that.

That lahmacun is, say, two feet long, rolled, the dough still soft in places, layers of thinly spread lamb mince, punchy fresh onion and a spicy saucey dressing turning it into a Swiss roll of savoury delights.We have a couple of bean salads with parsley and spices on the side, that ispanaki has been pre-sliced too but still looks like an enormous pizza.The food is good, the kebab fabulous, almost worth the interruption of the drive home from work, and the long, slow wait.But next time, because there will be a next time.

Norway,  deaths, . million population Finland, , .m Denmark, , .m Ireland, , .m Slovakia, , . all independent smaller countries, self-governing, economically self-sufficient within the EEC . Perhaps the conclusion to be drawn is that Scotlands response to the pandemic is being both directed by and hindered by the Westminster Government, the competence of which is already the subject of widespread criticism.Mr Stuart would like inquiries into the mistakes made in each wave, and I agree but any inquiry has to start with the conduct of the UK Government: its conflicting advice, its expenditure in billions to inexperienced private companies and its failure of leadership. As a consequence todays statistics give total deaths per million to date as , in Scotland and , in England ndash  per cent greater. This is not delusional point-scoring it is merely a reading of the numbers. It seems that Scotland, by comparison, is coping fairly well after all.Paul Scott, Edinburgh EH.SHRIDHAR WAS STATING THE OBVIOUSRATHER than having to ldquodefend its vaccine record , the Scottish Government should be congratulated for following JCVI advice and saving many lives in care homes since mid-December, whereas in England the death rate in care homes is currently approaching three times the rate in Scotland.Vaccinating in care homes is far more time-consuming and labour-intensive than in the community, and this is why overall figures are at this stage lower than in England. When opposition politicians made Covid a competition, Nicola Sturgeon resisted the temptation to point out that England has one of the worst death rates in the world and to date Scotlandrsquos rates are a third lower.Of the , jags that Ruth Davidson complained about, STV explained that , had already been injected with a further , scheduled for Wednesday, , were with GPs, , in transit from England and , were in England awaiting checks.Vaccines wonrsquot make Covid go away and the UK strategy for tackling the pandemic has failed. Devi Shridhar was merely stating the obvious when she said an independent Scotland would have been better able to tackle the pandemic and that Scotlandrsquos response to the crisis has been constrained by being part of the UK in respect of economic packages to extend lockdown and no control over borders like Denmark and Norway.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.ADVISER OUGHT TO STAND DOWNI AGREE with David Weller that Devi Sridhars comments in favour of one particular side of the constitutional debate are unhelpful,not highly inappropriate given her role as health advisor with a responsibility to inform the public and the government.In this role its her duty to share scientic expertise, not personal political views on a contentious, isive issue. For example, I cant recall that last year, during the first wave of the pandemic, any of the advisors to the UK Government publicly offered their personal opinion for or against Brexit. If they had done so, it probably would have been a resignation matter.Professor Sridhars comments should be treated as such. Alternatively,she feels the need to use her publicity to beat the drum for a particular political cause, she should resign now.Regina Erich, Stonehaven.CUT THE RED TAPE AROUND JABSNICOLA Sturgeon has been unable to satisfactorily defend the fact that more than , doses of Covid- vaccine allocated to Scotland are unused.In England, GPs order supplies directly from Vianto, the logistics company which specialises in distribution for the healthcare industry. The Scottish Government does things dferently, whereby GPs place orders with boards, who pass the information to NHS Scotland, who in turn advise Vianto.Perhaps less bureaucracy would help. At the current rate, those of us lucky enough to have had our first vaccination wonder about achievement of the -week target for the second, while friends in their th decade sit by their phones awaiting a call about an appointment for their first.These delays pose another question since no one seems to know for how long the approved vaccines will provide immunity, what plans,any, are in progress towards implementation of re-vaccination David Miller, Milngavie.VACCINE WILL MAKE BIG PROFITSIAIN Macwhirterasserts that AstraZeneca is making no profits out of the Oxford vaccine. Putting aside who veries this, my understanding is that this is only the case until the pandemic is over.Who decides when this will be is not stipulated, but presumably a time will be reached when the disease will be declared endemic, like seasonal flu. Some say this will be as soon as July this year. Taken together with the fact that countries have put many hundreds of millions of pounds into the development of the vaccine and that it will no doubt become an ongoing need, the gesture by the company may not be as philanthropic as first appears.It should also be noted that the pharmaceutical companies have been given indemnity against any future claims regarding long-term negative health impacts. For the avoidance of doubt I am not an anti-vaccination person but realistic enough to feel that the companies, and their shareholders, will make a lot of money in the longer term.Allistair Matheson, Selkirk.DONT BE COMPLACENT OVER THE USTHE tragedy of Neil Mackays excoriating article on the United States and much of its historyis that by far the most of it is true and very accurate. Its worthwhile asking, however, what stage in its historic development America is currently at and whether there are parallels with other stages of history.Listening to the still extremely influential, and recently pardoned, Steve Bannon, it is the medieval stage. He wants to \"put heads on spikes\". Perhaps, and this concerns centrally the Republican Party, it is Weimar Germany. Are political parties of the right prepared to work within constitutional and legal norms or as we saw last week, attempt to overthrow these norms by mobilising armed mobs  Maybe it is , the eve of the countrys civil war. It is not dficult to see that the logic of much opposition to Washington and \"big government\" is secession from the union.It goes without saying that decent people in this country will wish President Biden well. In doing so, however, we should not be too complacent. We have a Government in Westminster which routinely lies, sought to prorogue Parliament and set aside international law on key matters relating to the EU. Too little has been said about the British right-wings view of Donald Trump. Joe Bidens election will be a setback for them, although a victory for basic decency.Mr Mackay is inaccurate on a least one important point when talking about \"coups and death squads in Latin America in response to communist totalitarianism\". The government of Salvador Allende won a democratic election in Chile in .

However, I read this morning that the new President has placed in his Oval Office busts of Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks, Ceacutesar Chaacutevez and a sculpture of the Chiricahua Apache Tribe.I suggest that such signicant symbolism confirms that President Biden, described by Mr Mackay as being ldquoa good man for sure, obviously understands Americarsquos relationship with its history.While no one man can ldquofix a ided America, as Barack Obama for instance demonstrated, the fact that even a disappointingly narrow majority rejected what Donald Trump stands for must be recognised as grounds for hope. Even this slender hope will be a powerful force in the battle for Americarsquos soul which lies ahead in the coming years.John Milne, Uddingston.* PRESIDENT Biden made an excellent job yesterday of laying out to America and the rest of the world his highly-welcome policies, aspirations and road map.As an honourable, humane and committed team player he is well respected on both sider of the House and the Senate ndash as well as extensively throughout the world ndash and offers the perfect antidote to the Trumponavirus.First shot delivered yesterday.

Warming to her theme, she widens her arc of fire to attack even the sports quality here by decrying it as \"a boring two-horse race\" and mentions how \"streets empty\" where she lives when the Calcutta Cup is on.In expressing such ill-founded criticisms she undermines her principal point. She simply chooses not to accept that like it or not, football is big business, an important employer, is the biggest sport here bar none and consequently hugely important to many people, especially at present. She also lamentably fails to make any mention of the important role currently played by the charitable foundations of most clubs in the country in their community-based activities providing a support leline in material and psychological terms to many badly affected.Football and footballers are certainly not perfect but deserve a more balanced critique.Jack Davidson, Edinburgh EH.THANK YOU, MR SPEAKERI WRITE in order to convey my sincere thanks to the House of Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, for pursuing a small but important matter on my behalf with the Prime Minister at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions.I had written to Mr Speaker requesting that he draw to the attention ndash and correctpossible ndash Boris Johnsonrsquos continuous and inaccurate terminology when referencing the Scottish National Party as the Scottish Nationalist Party, pointing out this is inaccurate and, in my opinion, pejorative.Within a week, I received an informative reply from the Speakerrsquos Office, acknowledging my complaint and undertaking to address it, whilst admitting his powers were somewhat limited when dealing with MPs and the Prime Minister.At PMQs yesterday , in responding to a remote question from Ian Blackford joining the session from Skye concerning the UK Governmentrsquos future relationship with the new Biden administration, Mr Johnson replied: ldquoOf course we will work with President Biden to secure the transatlantic alliance and Nato, which of course the Scottish Nationalist Party would unbundle . To which Mr Speaker interjected: ldquoIt is the Scottish National Party, Prime Minister. I know you keep having a memory lapse on it.Of course, the PM would never refer to the Labour Party as the \"Laborious Party\" or his own organisation as ldquothe Conservatory Party\" so why has he, until now, got away with a wrong and prejudicial description, given the connotations of the term \"Nationalist\" Only time will tell whether Mr Johnson, who generally does not seem to grasp the basic premise of answering questions posed, will change his ways and call Scotlandrsquos largest party ndash by far ndash by its actual name and not one twisted to suit his own agenda.Mike Wilson, Longniddry.THIS IS A DAY FOR CELEBRATIONBELLS are being rung across Scotland at midday today . The reason  To celebrate the UN Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons that is coming into force on this day. Until now, nuclear weapons were the only weapons of mass destruction not banned under international law, despite their catastrophic humanitarian consequences. Now, with the treatyrsquos entry into force, we can call nuclear weapons what they are: prohibited weapons of mass destruction, just like chemical weapons and biological weapons. Seventy-five years on, the first resolution passed by the United Nations in January  to eliminate nuclear weapons is finally being realised. More than  years after the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world is saying \"never againrsquo\".It is now time that the UK Government stopped its involvement in this illegal activity.It is now time that the Scottish Government stopped its collusion in allowing Trident, and its planned replacement, to continue from its base in the west of Scotland, against the will of the Scottish people.It is also time, as we plan post-Covid for a just and green new deal, that we ensure that funds, currently squandered on illegal weapons of mass destruction, are erted to green jobs. Skills conversion from nuclear weapons and the arms industry to health, housing, education and transport is required.Dr Margaret Craig, Glasgow G.KEEP AN EYE ON COP DELEGATESVOLUNTEERS are being sought to help at the Glasgow COP  climate conference to assist delegates and promote Scotland .

To date, .per cent of Scotlands population has had a first dose, slightly behindof Wales with .% and trailing England and Northern Ireland, who have reached .% and % respectively.The Scottish Government insists that it has rightly prioritised immunisations for elderly care home residents, with more than % having had their first dose compared to % in England.Scotland began vaccinating in care homes a week earlier than England too, on December .There will be no Glastonbury music festival this summer, for the second year in a rowThere are signs that this strategy may be beginning to pay off, with Covid deaths in care homes in England up % last week to , - the highest level since mid-May - while in Scotland they fell by % from to  in the week to Sunday.Vaccination is only part of the story, however.Northern Ireland began vaccinating its older care home residents earlier than anywhere  in the UK, on December , and already three quarters have received first and second doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine after the countrys health authority decided to stick to the three-week timetable, which also applies to care home staff.Care home deaths in Northern Ireland rose by  last week - the highest number since MayDespite this, care home deaths in the country are still rising, doubling from  to  last week.More than anything , Scotland is better placed by simply having the lowest virus rates in the UK: per , compared to in Wales, in Northern Ireland, and in England.But that is unlikely to offer much consolation to over-s in the community in Scotland, who are beginning to feel left behind compared to peers where in the UK.Source: Public Health England By last weekend, % of over-s in Scotland had had a first dose of Covid vaccine compared to % of those in England, where GPs started inoculating this group back in mid-December.In areas where the majority of over-s have now been seen , the over-s and clinically extremely vulnerable have started to receive their invites, with Northern Ireland also expecting to begin offering jags to the over-s as early as next week.: Warning ridiculous bureaucracy for would-be vaccinators threatens ,-a-week jags planDr Alan Stout, chair of the BMA s GP committee in Northern Ireland said this week that \"by the end of January we will definitely have everyone aged over  vaccinated.In Scotland, that timescale has slipped to end of February, with the Scottish Government insisting that it is moving as fast as it can with the stocks it receives from the UK Government: hundreds of thousands of doses are reportedly still in storage in, or in transit from, England.GPs on the ground in Scotland are eager to get on with the job, and growing restless. Some have yet to receive any doses of vaccine at all, while other have had to cancel patients planned vaccinations at short notice because scheduled deliveries failed to turn up.: GPs in Scotland push for greater role in Covid vaccination schemeThis week, BMA leaders in Scotland called for the process to be \"streamlined\" to allow GPs to order supplies directly - as they do in England - instead of having to go via the health board.There are other hurdles to come, however. Beyond the over-s, GPs in many parts of Scotland are still in the dark about what their role will bewhen it comes to vaccinating the over-s and over-s, as the responsibility lies with health boards in Scotland.Based on the wave one trend, hospital admissions would be expected to fall low enough to begin lting lockdown by mid-MarchImportantly though, our exit strategy from lockdown must be about more than vaccines.In the first wave, Scotland waited more than ten weeks to begin easing lockdown on May , when hospital admissions for Covid were averaging . per day right now we are averaging . per day, and can probably expect to remain in lockdown until mid-March.When we do come out, we should look to the Asia-Pacic for a sustainable way of living with the virus until herd immunity is achieved, which is unlikely to come earlier than autumn.In New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan the virus has been virtually eliminated and the economy is thriving, with hospitality and leisure venues open, friends and family able to socialise indoors, and hospitals and care homes open to visitors.They are enjoying normal le - without a vaccine. We can have that, but it means not repeating the mistakes of last summer and reopening too much too soon.: If only taking back control had also included our borders in a pandemicOur borders should remain closed, and quarantine enforced usinghotels as it is in Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan for anyone arriving in the country - even UK nationals.Travel restrictions may have to remain in place within the UK too , and governments should do all they can in the meantime to compensate the travel industry for its losses.International arrivals entering New Zealand are escorted from the airport into managed isolation in Government-appointed hotels. Those who test positive or develop Covid symptoms are moved into quarantine hotelsCases must be driven back down to the lows of last July, but crucially much more has to be done to improve peoples ability to comply with self-isolation through better financial supportand practical support, such as putting infected people up in isolation hotels where meals are brought to your door, as they do in New York.In New York, Covid volunteers even walk your dog for you.If this sounds costly, imagine the cost of a third wave lockdown.

So he plumped for ldquoN...nothing wrong with, with um, being woke.This was a strange concession given that just a few weeks ago we saw his Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss come down hard on the \"woke brigade\" who apparently want to \"introduce quotas, ersity agendas and so-called unconscious bias training\".And just this week his trusty Secretary of State for Housing Robert Jenrick criticised the \"woke worthies\" who seemingly want to expunge ious dficult bits of British history.Itrsquos hard being a politician but itrsquos harder when you desperately have to keep factions within your own party sweet, and create some sort of newsworthy copy over and above the dreadful daily death totals from coronavirus.I have a certain degree of sympathy for Johnsonrsquos befuddlement. Apart from being grammatically jarring, the word \"woke\" is definitely problematic.Originating in the US as a term to describe those who were awake to social and racial injustice, at some stage it metamorphosed. Some woke folk got a tad judgemental. Woke became less about activism and more about a label.In  Barack Obama said: ldquoThis idea of purity, and yoursquore never compromised and yoursquore always politically wokehellipyou should get over that quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities.Some woke folk shut down debate where people could learn from one another and perhaps change their views. Some groups got tired of discussing their oppression ndash and who can blame them after decades of doing so Woke got attitude, the word somehow got completely corrupted and the new and more pejorative definition of woke sprang up: Unyielding, unlistening, wanting to remove everything in its way that doesnrsquot fit with its worldview. This definition seems to prevail at the moment.But thatrsquos not the definition of woke I and many others recognise. Former Tory minister Ed Vaizey was spot on when he said on Times Radio this week that Joe Biden is ldquowoke in the best way, which is that he celebrates the traditions of America. He swore his oath on Lincolnrsquos Bible and swore to defend the constitution, and he had a wonderful  year old poet reading at his address.Lord Vaizey continued: ldquoMaybe Irsquom not noble enough to be woke. I want to be woke.If woke is to strive for social and racial justice and equality then surely we should all want to be woke I mean, Irsquod like to think Irsquom woke. No confusion there surely  Fairly clear cut really. From my early days as a student getting the overnight bus to London to protest against apartheid outside the South African Embassy, Irsquove always been an advocate of equality. But, just to double-check, I asked one of my student sons, currently cocooned back with me during these lockdown times, to confirm I am woke.He looked at me sympathetically and, aswishing to assuage my lsquofearsrsquo touched my arm gently and said, lsquoNo, mum, yoursquore not woke. Donrsquot worry so much.rsquoI gulped. But...but...what about the anti-Iraq war march I took you on when you were two years old what about the gender neutral toys I bought for you what about the equal pay placards you helped me make with your Crayolas, what about the trip to Turnberry to protest at Trump in , what about our daily dinner table discussions about trans rights and Black Lives Matter lsquoThe clue is in the word discussion,rsquo he said. Woke people donrsquot want to discuss and debate.Strange noises, similar to Boris Johnsonrsquos, but not half as upper class, gurgled from my mouth as confusion and utter disappointment enveloped me.The younger son then emerged from his black hole to ask who wanted to knowI was woke.Itrsquos for an article, I replied.lsquoOh no. PULEASE donrsquot tell people you think yoursquore woke, itrsquos the ultimate virtue signalling.rsquoI replied, more confused than ever: Butwoke is bad, how is it virtue signalling He shot back: Well, it depends who is defining woke and who is defining virtue.rsquoAt this point I slapped my frazzled forehead, marched out of the room and headed out for a long walk.If one word could cause such high level confusion in one small family, imagine what it was doing to Boris Johnsonrsquos brain.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Boris Johnson cannot deny democracy, he has to respect democracy.Almost a year after Covid- struck, the country is now suffering a third wave and another lockdown with the death toll across the UK nearing the grim milestone of , deaths and Scotland approaching its own of , deaths.Asked , in such circumstances, he still believed Indyref had to take place this year, Mr Blackford replied: ldquoIn terms of sequencing, the responsibility that we have is to deal with the pandemic first and take our responsibilities for the health of everyone.ldquoOnce we are in a position of safety, it is right we have that conversation about Scotlandrsquos constitutional future and we reflect on what Covid has meant, what Brexit has meant and it is right at that point, as quickly as possible, we have that independence referendum.The party leader went on: ldquoYou talked about Scotland being in lockdown until mid-February, I would characterise that as Scotland being in lockdown until at least mid-February and, of course, all of us want to be able to reverse these lockdown measures as soon as we can but caution has to be the watchword.But he stressed: ldquoWhat I am not doing is saying that an independence referendum canrsquot take place but we have to do things in a sequential way.Mr Blackford insisted what was important was that people in Scotland had an open and honest debate about the nationrsquos future and that opponents of independence and those who had fears about it were listened to with respect.ldquoTheir voice, their attitude and their opinions are just as important as ours are. If we do make that journey to become an independent country, itrsquos really important we seek to bring people back together.He then stressed: ldquoItrsquos not just an ambition to win this, itrsquos an ambition to win well, which is important because it then delivers that clear message on behalf of all the people of Scotland, that settled will, but one which very much has to take on board the views of those who are not currently with us."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12119449.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-independence-snp-roadmap-unveiled-second-vote","story":"A new plan for indyref has been unveiled by constitutional secretary Michael Russell, who says that there will be a referendumScotland votes for pro-independence parties at the Holyrood election in May.ldquoPeople in Scotland have the right to decide their future ndash not Boris Johnson,\" he said.ldquoThe pandemic is the overriding priority at present but when that subsides the people of Scotland must have the right to decide how best to rebuild our country.:Ian Blackford: Yes campaign not only has to win Indyref, it has to win it big to unite ScotlandldquoThat right to choose will be central to our election campaign message.Last year, theScottish Government was working on legislation to allow a second independence referendum.

In the middle of winterthere are issues with the payment scheme then people need to have confidence that they can get those issues sorted quickly. Warm homes are not negotiable.“I understand that some government services may be disrupted by the pandemic, but this is one measure that really ought to be in place and working, particularly as the advice is for vulnerable people to stay at home.”Mr Carmichael said: “We have given more than enough patience to the Government to get this issue sorted. It is time for Secretary of State to take an active interest and make sure that the system is back in order so that eligible islanders can keep their heating going through the rest of the winter. Given the problems raised already in our campaign with Ofgem on energy costs, it is vital that ministers get on top of these basic issues.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the letter Mr Carmichael highlighted the lack of information on how businesses can access the scheme and concerns about the cap on claims.Commenting on the letter, Mr Carmichael said: “We need immediate clarity on the detail of the compensation scheme. I have already heard of businesses which have taken losses saying they do not think they will be able to access the support so clear guidance is vital.“Funds to make good the losses incurred by local businesses are welcome but they are only part of the story. It is welcome news that groupage shipments are starting to move again but isles companies tell me that they cannot see ato a “Day  – Day ” service for small groupage any time soon.

It’s important they don’t get left behind and are given every chance of competing in fast-moving online markets.“Feedback from local businesses in Orkney suggests more needs to be done to provide help in the short term. The DigitalBoost fund, offering help with online marketing, is a welcome initiative and hopefully it will reopen to applications soon. Help is also needed, though, to allow businesses to improve packing and develop distribution channels.“I’m pleased that Mr Ewing recognised these points and offered to give them further consideration. Time is of the essence, however, and the need made all the greater by the impact of Brexit.“I will be following this up with the cabinet secretary to see what more might be done to support Orkney’s world class food and drink sector.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Skye and Lochalsh LGOWIT co-ordinator Kate Hathway purchased the bikes on behalf of the project following a successful bid to the Energy Saving Trust last year.. “Kyle had been identied as a priority area and electric bikes looked like a good option for a wide age range of folk.”The e-bikes were delivered a month into the first lockdown so were quickly utilised by key workers. Since their arrival there have been  free trials, averaging three weeks per user. Common long-term conditions are arthritis, fibromyalgia, joint-replacement rehabilitation, anxiety and depression and those who struggle with weight bearing exercise. The bikes are stored on Church Road and are maintained by Kate’s husband, Ian Mackay, owner of Skye MTB Adventures.“While we have prioritised people with long-term conditions –around  per cent of users – we’ve also enabled wider members of the community to trial them as it’s better that they’re out and about all the time,” said Kate. “With the dferent power setting options the bikes can be as easy or as challenging as you want them to be.“Initially a taxi-trike was purchased along with four bikes but it just couldn’t cope with the hills in the area, so an additional two bikes will be bought to replace the trike.“It’s a shame because the idea of the trike was to help combat isolation and get folk stuck at home out and about in the fresh air,” Kate said.The project is due to continue until August  and between now and then LGOWIT will consider legacy ideas for the e-bikes beyond that date.“If the Skye cycle way ever gets developed then it would be great to have a fleet of e-bikes available for the community as part of a network joining Kyle, Kyleakin and Broadford and so that would definitely be a good option to explore,” Kate added.If you would like a free trial of an e-bike contact Kate Hathway on ,   or lgowitkate@highlandtsi.org.uk"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SKYES-THE-LIMIT-The-Hiker-Bikers-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skyes the limit 2 fundraiser is off to a flying","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye#s the Limit  began on Friday th and by Tuesday this week it had raised £.The charity challenge has tasked people to clock as many hours of exercise as they can as teams between January th and February th while raising money for Skye Cancer Care and Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.One of the teams involved in this year’s fundraising efforts is the Hiker Bikers, led by team captain Tim Moore.The team is made up of Tim and his we, Christine, along with their friends Ronald and Catriona MacDonald.Tim and Christine have been married for  years and have lived on Skye for  years.They are now both retired having run their own business, Skye Linen Services, which they built up from scratch.Over the past  years, Tim and Christine have been involved with countless charities and societies on the island, Tim served as an auxiliary coastguard in Portree for  years, while Christine was a founder member of the committee for the Portree Leboat guild.Christine now helps out at Crossroads Care, while they were both heavily involved in coordinating and distributing food deliveries during the first lockdown as part of the Skye Community Response effort..He said: “Our goals for this challenge are for Chris and I, with Brandy and Meg [their dogs], to walk - hours each week, so about - miles, and when we can about two to three hours cycling a week – not with Brandy and Meg, who stay at home since they cannot pedal!“Catriona and Ronald will have no doubt more time planned for cycling than we can manage, though.”As captain, Tim has the responsibility of tallying up what Ronald and Catriona have accomplished and add that to his and Christine’s total to determine what the team has achieved for the week.He added: “Our goals are simply to maintain fitness, help the cause, have fun, get soaked – well we get soaked most days anyway!”Event organiser Sam Crowe said she was impressed by the response to the second edition of the Skye’s the Limit challenge.She said: “Skye’s the Limit  is aimed at raising money for local charities and getting the folk of Skye fit, and it has got off to a brilliant start.“Well done to the teams for raising so much already.“We have had lots of positive feedback from the teams involved.”She added: “The challenge is getting folk out and about in all weathers and helping to raise some much needed money for valuable local charities.

Chief Inspector Gerard Pollock from Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Contact Management Centre says the public often ring ‘’ to get in touch with an officer about an incident they’ve already reported, or to obtain an incident reference number. Chief Inspector Pollock explains: “We want to make it easier to contact the officer dealing with your incident by consistently providing that information up front and in a timely way.” In January, the first phase will roll out for online reports. The second phase roll-out will be for  calls and over-the-counter reports. It’s hoped this will start later in Spring . “Currently, we advise anyone who makes a report online whether police will be attending or not by email when we receive a report, and the incident reference number,” explains Chief Inspector Pollock. “However, we will be introducing new feedback to include details of the attending officer and how to get in touch, details of how to contact your local neighbourhood policing team and key crime prevention tips to help keep you safe from crime in the future. “This provides a simple and clear record of your report to the Police Service along with key details should you need to get in touch about the incident. The key here is making the attending officer more accessible to the public, while also using that as an opportunity to deliver timely crime prevention advice to reduce their risk of becoming a victim of crime in the future.” Chief Inspector Pollock recognises not everyone has, or uses e-mail, and says officers will still contact people by phone. However, we have seen a growing trend in  of people going online to report incidents with a % rise on , he explains. During our current online reporting process you have a choice to provide your email address and overwhelmingly the public choose to do so, so that’s why we’re starting with online reports. For those who do provide an email address during the process they will receive the officer’s email address and work mobile number which they can use to contact them. “Policing is   and our officers work a range of shts,” says Chief Inspector Pollock. “That often means it can be a number of days before they are on duty at an appropriate time to call someone to provide an update. In order to keep our victims updated we want to ensure we use all the resources available to us, including email.” Chief Inspector Pollock adds: “We see this as an enhancement to our current service options, not a replacement, and we understand some people do not have an email account. So, for those people we will continue to provide those key details via our ‘’ service. However, we also recognise for many people that’s no longer the best way for them, so we’re providing a range of options that meet the needs of our communities.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3590687.jpg--.jpg?1611323713000\n","title":"one of local football s true gentlemen","story":"THE football fraternity in Ballymena said farewell to a true gentleman last week with the passing of Mr. Robert James Thompson.Known to all as Bertie, he will always be associated with the formation and growth of the illustrious Wakehurst FC from hunble beginnings to domination of the local junior football scene - especially in the s.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSinister graffiti warning that all border post staff are targets has appeared near Larne Port. David O#DornanJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPolice are probing a sinister threat made to employees working at Northern Ireland’s Border Control Ports.The investigation was launched after graffiti warning that “all border post staff are targets” appeared in Larne.It prompted officials at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto alert the operators of the facilities at Larne, Belfast and Warrenpoint.A leaked internal memo seen by the Belfastwas sent out by the Brexit Operational Readiness department.It said: “To be aware, the below appeared overnight near Larne Port. There is nothing to suggest at this time that this is anything other than an isolated incident.“However, this may understandably cause you your teams concern but be assured that DAERA have engaged with the PSNI, who are dealing with the matter appropriately.“DAERA will continue to liaise with the PSNI to ensure that your health, safety and welfare, and that of our delivery partners, remains our utmost priority.“I would be gratefulyou could ask your relevant staff to report anything suspicious in the area of the Port to either ourselves, PSNI or Port Security.”Border Control Postfacilities came into operation from January  because of Brexit with a de facto Irish Sea border regarding movements of goods from Great Britain and the Northern Ireland protocol.While its fundamental purpose is to prevent a hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland it means that instead there are customs checks at our ports.TUV leader Jim Allister said: “No one, either through actual threats or headline-grabbing threats, should be resorting to matters pertaining to violence in respect of any issue.“There is a place for, indeed a necessary place, for political opposition to the partition of the United Kingdom. But that should be coming from particularly the political leadership of unionism.”Alliance East Antrim MLA Stewart Dickson added: “While there is no excuse for this, sadly some will attempt to justy it by linking it with Brexit. The reality is, it is just thugs again attempting to assert their dominance in the area.”DUP MP for East Antrim Sammy Wilson said: Throughout all of this Brexit debate, the only people who have threatened violence as far any checks are concerned, have been those who supported the Remain campaign.And that includes people who time and time again talked about threats of violence from the IRA and republicansthere were border posts put along the border between Northern Ireland the Irish Republic and yet they have been strangely silent, the same crowd, when a border has been placed between Northern Ireland and GB.So unionists are the only people who never at any stage threatened there would be violence as a result of whatever arrangements came and arose from Brexit.And that is still my position and still our position that this is still an issue that unionists feel very sore about, feel betrayed by, have fears about the future because of the erection of these border posts and the disruption which they have caused and the dference which it makes between us and the rest of the United Kingdom.But I believe, and indeed there has been evidence already this week, that through political pressure and through using what leverage we have we can first of all get some of the immediate problems of the protocol dealt with and in the longer run I believe the protocol itself will be shown to be unworkable.“There is a political battle to be fought here and I don’t think anything will be achieved by writing messages on the walls and it has not been the approach which unionists have.”Meanwhile, a source has said there are fears in Warrenpoint that the BCP there could be targeted by dissident republicans.They said: “Where it’s located is at the Narrow Water Castle, and anyone who knows the history about Narrow Water will know about the bomb that went off there . So there is a credible threat as nobody wants to see a border infrastructure of any shape or description in this area, and similarly I don’t think the loyalists want to see border inspection in Larne.”A DAERA spokesperson said the department was “aware of this incident and are liaising with the PSNI”.The PSNI said: “Police are aware of a graffiti incident the vicinity of Larne Harbour on January . This matter is currently under investigation.”Belfast Most ReadIan Paisley is fth most expensive MP in UKLoyalists hold talks with NIO to express anger over Irish sea borderBelfast delicatessen Sawers hits out at traffic warden #targeting a small business trying to survive#Nine police officers face Covid breach sanctionsTributes paid to Mac O#Neill who died in road accident near BallymoneyLatest Northern IrelandQuestions over control of Sinn Fein part of #misogynistic# and #lazy# narrative, says O#Neill Twelve further deaths with Covid in Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths and  new casesMan appears in court accused of raping -year-old girlMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and hospital occupancyLatest from Belfast Kenneth Branagh to play Boris Johnson in new Covid- drama Man City given huge scare by League Two Cheltenham before late turnaroundSir Kenneth Branagh to star in drama about Boris Johnson’s handling of pandemicCustomers rally for coffee shop ‘completely destroyed’ by floodingQuestions over control of Sinn Fein part of #misogynistic# and #lazy# narrative, says O#Neill ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s a good piece of business and there probably are a few others to come, he added.We#ve supplied Boots for four years in the South. They would have been bringing in sandwiches from Great Britain, but they#ve decided to support local. His company employs  people.The Northern Ireland Protocol, part of Boris Johnson#s EU deal, means that checks must take place on food products of animal origin moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.That adds costs, though Northern Ireland companies may be able to step infirms on the other side of the Irish Sea no longer wish to ship here. Pure Roast Coffee in Lisburn said it had picked up about  customers from online rivals that have indicated they will no longer ship across the Irish Sea.The business sources its own beans to make coffee bags and coffee pods. Sales executive Adam Hewitt said demand from consumers was growing. One Co Down buyer of Nestle#s Dolce Gusto pods said he had been informed that deliveries to Ireland had been suspended indefinitely. This is a minor issue but signicant in the sense that it#s an example of how Brexit is adversely impacting on le here, he added.Dolce Gusto did not reply to a request for comment.Mr Hewitt said: We have noticed quite an up-tick on our website for business here and we#re buying a lot more machinery to enable us to go for the consumer and home market.There are a lot of opportunities for companies in Northern Ireland. The demand is there. This week about  to  customers who used to get their coffee online have come across to us.Michael Bell, executive director of the NI Food and Drink Federation, said it was too early to tell whether or not Northern Ireland would emerge better off from the protocol. He insisted we would not know the long-term rules until after the grace period expired and stressed that continued access to the Great Britain market was essential. We are in something of a  dawn at the minute as there are a number of derogations in place to allow things to work, he added.He said trade in food and drink on the Irish Sea had been sustainable up until now because lorries carrying materials from Great Britain couldwith Northern Ireland produce.But he also claimed thatthe Northern Ireland market become less attractive for Great Britain, there would be fewer lorries - removing a route to market.We sell three-and-a-half times to four times as much food in Great Britain as we do at home. We may be having small wins in the home market but there may yet be a signicant loss in Great Britain, Mr Bell explained.Belfast Most ReadLoyalists hold talks with NIO to express anger over Irish sea borderIan Paisley is fth most expensive MP in UKBelfast delicatessen Sawers hits out at traffic warden #targeting a small business trying to survive#Nine police officers face Covid breach sanctionsTributes paid to Mac O#Neill who died in road accident near BallymoneyLatest Northern IrelandQuestions over control of Sinn Fein part of #misogynistic# and #lazy# narrative, says O#Neill Twelve further deaths with Covid in Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths and  new casesMan appears in court accused of raping -year-old girlMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and hospital occupancyLatest from Belfast Residents plead with PM to upgrade defences after town flooded for third yearPep Guardiola hails Man City response after Cheltenham threatened huge cup shockThree city workers arrested amid £ million bounce back loan fraud probeLove Island’s Yewande Biala accuses Lucie Donlan of ‘racialised re-naming’Southampton dump holders Arsenal out of FA Cup as Manchester City survive scare,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Another % are undecided on the issue. The LucidTalk survey carried out in Northern Ireland found that among those aged under , supporters of Irish reunication outnumber those who want to stay in the UK by % to %Northern Irish voters also think there will be a united Ireland within  years by a margin of % to %.The study was based on , people aged over  surveyed between January  and  this year.Of those asked in England, only  percent would be upset at Irish unication, with  percent pleased and  percent not bothered.The Scottish section of the survey found that  percent of those asked would not be bothered by a united Ireland,  percent would be pleased and  percent would be upset.The only time a border poll was held in Northern Ireland was in March , but it was boycotted by nationalists. The voter turnout was  percent, with  wishing to remain part of the UK.A four-country survey based on separate polls in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales found that a majority of voters in Scotland and Wales want referendums on their unity with the United Kingdom. Cabinet ministers, chaired by Michael Gove, and the secretaries of state for each devolved nation met last week to discuss plans for a new campaign to build the case for the union.The surveys come a short time after former Conservative chancellor George Osborne said most people in England would not carevoters cast a majority for a united Ireland.He wrote in the Evening Standard: “By remaining in the EU single market, itis for all economic intents and purposes now slowly becoming part of a united Ireland.“Northern Irish unionists always feared the mainland was not sufficiently committed to their cause. Now their short-sighted support for Brexithas made those fears a reality.“It pains me to report that most here and abroad will not care.”The poll shows voters expect Scotland to become independent within the next decade by margins far in excess of two to one in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Scottish poll, conducted by Panelbase, found the SNP is on course for success in the Scottish parliament elections due in May - which is likely to be the trigger for a new political crisis.The piece suggested Nicola Sturgeon would use this to ask for a new independence vote, but it quotes senior government sources who say Boris Johnson will flatly refuse that demand, with the UK government having little intention of offering early concessions on further devolution.In the  referendum, Scotland voted against independence by . percent to . percent, with a turnout of . percent.YouGov, which conducted the surveys in Wales and England, found that support for Welsh independence has grown to %, up from the teens five years ago.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the polls place an obligation on parties to set out a new vision for the future that meets the needs of all. A decade of UK government policy that has stripped public services, removed opportunity from some communities and forced a new constitutional reality on the people of Northern Ireland and Scotland has had profound consequences, he said. I genuinely believe that our interests are best served in a new Ireland and that’s reflected in the hours of conversations we have held with people across this island, he said. The coming conversation places a solemn obligation on those of use who believe in a new future to engage with every community, sector and generation to set out our vision for a country and a society that meets the needs, hopes and aspirations of all our people.

What I#m afraid we#re seeing is people just being blasé or inaccurate about what the agreement actually means.Sir Jonathan told Prospect Magazine that was potentially storing up trouble for the future.Either you end up in the place where we ended up on the internal market bill - of ministers effectively implying that they#re prepared to ignore the bits of the agreement they don#t like, which would be a very serious problem.Or you have people basically being misled about what the agreement requires, or what it means. And then that will all be exposed.He added: I think that#s already happening. People [who were] led to believe that there#ll be no border checks, or that trade will flow as smoothly as [it] did when we were in the single market, are learning that that#s just not true. So you have a mismatch between the rhetoric and reality… and at worst, it implies a willingness of the government to somehow magic away the bits of the agreement that it no longer likes.Asked about the possibility of terminating the Northern Ireland protocol, he said there were mechanisms for Britain to raise concerns with the EU and resolve the problems.Sir Jonathan said: If the Government is saying it wants to use the mechanisms available to improve the operation of the new arrangements, then that would be perfectly understandable.If the Government were to be saying: #It#s outrageous that the EU member states are now imposing checks# - of the kind they#re perfectly entitled to impose - and that these are grounds somehow for the UK to walk away from the agreement, that would be pretty self-destructive.I hope that is not what is being said. If the UK continually gives the impression that it#s prepared to depart from its obligations when it decides they don#t suit, that I would have thought is a terrible message to send to the EU and to every other partner, or potential partner.Belfast Most ReadLoyalists hold talks with NIO to express anger over Irish sea borderIan Paisley is fth most expensive MP in UKBelfast delicatessen Sawers hits out at traffic warden #targeting a small business trying to survive#Nine police officers face Covid breach sanctionsTributes paid to Mac O#Neill who died in road accident near BallymoneyLatest Northern IrelandQuestions over control of Sinn Fein part of #misogynistic# and #lazy# narrative, says O#Neill Twelve further deaths with Covid in Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths and  new casesMan appears in court accused of raping -year-old girlMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and hospital occupancyLatest from Belfast Southampton dump holders Arsenal out of FA Cup as Manchester City survive scareKenneth Branagh to play Boris Johnson in new Covid- drama Man City given huge scare by League Two Cheltenham before late turnaroundSir Kenneth Branagh to star in drama about Boris Johnson’s handling of pandemicCustomers rally for coffee shop ‘completely destroyed’ by flooding,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At this stage it is not possible to say when we will complete the search but we anticipate that it will run at least into tomorrow.The disruption started on January  when police responded to reports of a suspicious device being left in the area.The CIRA claimed they had opened fire on a police helicopter on the evening of January  - a claim the PSNI denied.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmmo find: The scene in Wattle Bridge where a suspect device and ammunition were discovered by policeKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAmmo find: The scene in Wattle Bridge where a suspect device and ammunition were discovered by policeOn Tuesday officers saidthe claims were true they believed a privately owned helicopter flying in the area on Thursday evening may have been targeted by the group. The helicopter did not sustain any damage and those on board were unaware it was being fired at.Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation in Northern Ireland, condemned the attempt on the lives of officers.We know these republican groups are continuously looking for ways to murder the men and women I represent. Police officers have to be cautious and alert on a continuous basis. There can be no let-up in vigilance, he said. In their warped thinking, killing or maiming an officer may be seen to advance a political agenda. They couldn#t be further from the truth or more detached from society. A severe terrorist threat is the reality of what police officers have to deal with daily and thankfully we have been able to thwart them in their evil ambitions through a combination of expertise, patience, meticulous procedures and investigations.First Minister Arlene Foster said those behind the attack were crazed political ideologues, telling them to back off.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmmo find: The scene in Wattle Bridge where a suspect device and ammunition were discovered by policeKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAmmo find: The scene in Wattle Bridge where a suspect device and ammunition were discovered by policeSinn Fein MP Michelle Gildernew described the attack as futile and pathetic.Armed groups have no place in our society, they must disband immediately and allow our communities to progress in peace, the Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP said.Newtownbutler, situated near the border with Co Monaghan, has previously seen dissident republican activity, and this is not the first attempt to lure police to the Wattlebridge Road area.While responding to a security alert in August , police and Army Technical Officers narrowly escaped injury after inspecting a hoax device before a bomb exploded on the main A Cavan Road.Police have said the CIRA were also behind a booby trap device in Craigavon in July  and an explosive device on a heavy goods vehicle in Lurgan in January .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMark Lindsay FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMark LindsayBelfast Most ReadLoyalists hold talks with NIO to express anger over Irish sea borderIan Paisley is fth most expensive MP in UKBelfast delicatessen Sawers hits out at traffic warden #targeting a small business trying to survive#Nine police officers face Covid breach sanctionsTributes paid to Mac O#Neill who died in road accident near BallymoneyLatest Northern IrelandQuestions over control of Sinn Fein part of #misogynistic# and #lazy# narrative, says O#Neill Twelve further deaths with Covid in Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths and  new casesMan appears in court accused of raping -year-old girlMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and hospital occupancyLatest from Belfast Love Island’s Yewande Biala accuses Lucie Donlan of ‘racialised re-naming’Southampton dump holders Arsenal out of FA Cup as Manchester City survive scareKenneth Branagh to play Boris Johnson in new Covid- drama Man City given huge scare by League Two Cheltenham before late turnaroundSir Kenneth Branagh to star in drama about Boris Johnson’s handling of pandemic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For my entire le the Catholic Church and the authorities hid her identity from me when I finally found out who she was last year it was too late, she’d already died.” Mark McCollum’s mother, Kathleen McGuire, grew up in the Bogside in the s. She fell pregnant following a relationship with a Donegal man who served in the British Army at Ebrington Barracks. Like many unmarried women who became pregnant at the time, she was sent to a mother and baby home - in this case Marianvale in Newry . It was viewed as a ‘mortal sin’ by the Catholic Church, Mark said, which exerted its power over the community in those days. googletag.cmd.push Having a child out of wedlock was frowned upon it brought ‘shame and stigma’ to families, he added. “Once the Church knew or somebody rang a priest it was out of your hands. You knew where you were going and she was sent to Marianvale in Newry. “You did what the priest said, it was very hard to stand up to the Church. And we as children were the embodiment of sin, the spoiled fruit, the bad babies. “We were second class and they didn’t carewe lived or died. “We had to be put in nice Christian families to be redeemed.” googletag.cmd.push Mark was born and taken to Nazareth House in Fahan. He doesn’t even knowhis -year-old mother got to hold him before he was whisked away. Mark went on to live a very happy le as an only child with his adoptive parents in Raphoe. A short time after giving birth Kathleen moved to England. She would neverto Derry again.  STONEWALLED As a teenager at school and throughout his adult le Mark expended a lot of energy in search of his mother. Mark says he was met with preication any time he sought information. He was essentially ‘stonewalled’ by the Catholic Church, social services and other authorities.     In the late s he visited Marianvale where a priest, with a rudimentary laptop, was able to run through every detail of Mark’s le and that of his adoptive parents. He said: “I assumed then that he had all the details about my mother as well but he wouldn’t give it to me. “That’s the way it was, they had all this information, social workers had it, but we were not deemed worthy to have it. “Even to this day they won’t do it. It’s so frustrating.” Until last year Mark was of the belief that his mother was from Belfast, that’s what he had been told for decades. The Donegal man also found out that he was originally called Paul, all of these details made it nigh on impossible for Mark to find Kathleen and vice versa. “It was like trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together with lots of missing pieces. “And when I did find out that her name was Kathleen McGuire and she was from Derry it was too late, she passed away several years ago,” an exasperated Mark explained. What he did learn is that she relocated to Bradford and married a bus driver who died very young. Sadly, Kathleen didn’t have any more children. As someone who obtained double first-class honours in psychology, Mark is aware of the emotional toll it must have took. He said: “The treatment she received can leave a deep emotional scar and these girls were told they were dirty and the lowest of the low. “A lot of women subsequently had issues with intimacy.” A sorrowful Mark continued: “Her own health wasn’t great I don’t think and I think she ended up in a nursing home where she passed away. “I’m now trying to find out where she was buried in England.” After posting a message on the Creggan Memories Facebook page, Mark connected with Kathleen’s siblings and was able to find out more about her. The pandemic has thwarted opportunities to meet in person but communications have been positive and the family want her story to be told. Over the years Mark has visited Derry on many occasions never knowing his familial ties. In a strange twist of fate, one of his first jobs involved working on houses in Dove Gardens – a street that sits right next to the one where his mother grew up. He also performed in the Playhouse as part of his theatre work, and studied and worked at Ulster University’s Magee campus. “All the time I never knew that I was a wee Derry mucker,” he quipped.

INVESTIGATION Last week the Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin apologised after an investigation into the country’s mother and baby homes in the Republic of Ireland. About , children died in the  institutions under investigation. The report found an ‘appalling level of infant mortality’ in the homes which were established in the th and th centuries. The Taoiseach expressed regret for the ‘profound and generational wrong’ to survivors of mother-and-baby homes. The Irish government said the report revealed the country had a ‘stling, oppressive and brutally misogynistic culture’. However, Mark believes the language in the report attempts to absolve the government and church of blame and instead point the finger at the parents and society. “They were completely culpable for this system that ran for  years and more,” he said. “The Church were riding roughshod over state law and adhering to Diocesan Law and Canon Law. “They didn’t recognise the law, it was Derry and Raphoe so it was an all-Ireland approach so the report is flawed because it’s not playing by the same rules the church did.” He is disappointed that it precludes women and adoptees from Northern Ireland as the homes were run on an All-Ireland basis with babies from homes in NI being fostered by families living over the border. This isn’t ancient history, he stressed, as ‘the last one closed in ’. He said the Primate of All Ireland, Eamon Martin, apologised but not to women and children in the North. Mark counts himself amongst many mothers and babies who were in similar homes in Northern Ireland who want an inquiry to be held in the North. He said there should be a ‘full, unreserved apology’ which doesn’t attempt to sht blame, reparations for victims and memorials to those who died. “Marianvale is set for demolition and there isn’t even a note outside to say what it was,” a disbelieving Mark said. Stormont commissioned research into whether or not there should an inquiry held into the homes which operated in Northern Ireland. It is due to be published by the end of this month. In a statement last week after the publication of the report in the South, Archbishop Eamon Martin, leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, accepted that the church was clearly part of that culture in which people were frequently stigmatised, judged and rejected.

A few years ago, they were All-Stars,” Brennan told Cahair OKane after the game. “Like Conleith Gilligan and the others, they don’t become bad players in a short space of time. Paddy Bradley looked sharp as he scored -  “They’re very good in training, they keep themselves in good condition and they’ve shown tonight that they have a massive amount to offer this year.” googletag.cmd.push Cavan actually scored the first point through a Paddy Gumley free but Derry hit seven unanswered points in  minutes to take a decisive lead. Cavan dropped Padraig O’Reilly back as a sweeper to try and limit Derry’s scoring before half-time, but the home side’s struggle at midfield was highlighted when they took Ciaran Galligan off seven minutes before the break. They did briefly recover to make it - to - but after Michael Drumm took a nice point, Bradley and Gilligan put on the after burners to make it - to - at the interval. Clearly knowing that Derry wouldn’t enjoy the same superiority in the second half, John Brennan brought on Barry McGuigan to replace Niall McNicholl, with the Slaughtneil man slotting in at half-forward and pushing Ciaran McGoldrick further up. googletag.cmd.push Cavan’s plan for the second half was evident from the throw in. They got it and hoofed it as high and as far down the field as they could. Eventually, they copped on that it wasn’t working and changed it. It took them  minutes to really make their impact on the second half. They scored just two points, only one of which came from play, in that first segment of the second period. However, Gerard Pierson clipped over a couple of lovely scores and from a comfortable position, Derry found their lead cut to three points with a quarter of an hour to play.

He kicked Derry’s final score after a one-two from a free ten minutes from time, and although Michael Brennan did lash the ball past debutant ‘keeper Danny Devlin from a tight angle with four minutes to go, the visitors went home with the first two points of the year.

Whether it’s helping to organise a fundraiser, volunteering his time or simply making a donation, Martin has always been more than generous. His kind nature and willingness to put others before himself have meant he has helped many charities and people in need over the years. For Martin, however, he says he only wants to put smiles on faces. Born in Crebarkey, on the outskirts of Dungiven, Martin moved to the north Derry town with his family when he was just five years old. googletag.cmd.push Prior to their arrival in Dungiven, Martin attended the old schoolhouse in Cashel, a journey he made on foot each day alongside his siblings. Following their move to the town, Martin, one of nine children – five boys and four girls – continued with his schooling there. From a young age, Martin always showed a good work ethic, and it wasn’t long before he secured his first part-time job – delivering the Coleraine Chronicle newspaper to locals. “I was still at school at the time, but I really enjoyed that wee job. I had eight dozen papers to deliver at the time and it kept me busy,” laughed Martin. googletag.cmd.push “After that, I got a job on Turner’s block and milk lorry and that was something I really enjoyed too.” Martin recalls a happy childhood growing up and has fond memories of gathering potatoes as a youth and playing marbles with his friends. “When I was younger, we used to kick a ball about the green down at Mitchell Park. There was maybe about  or  of us and we would have played soccer or Gaelic football in dferent wee teams. It was great craic and there was very little traffic about then. “I also remember we used to go down to the ‘Pound House’ and play marbles and stuff. There was an aul footgo down there and we used to go down and swing from it to pass the time. The craic growing up was mighty,” he laughed.     After leaving school, Martin, like many other young men his age, choose a career in the construction industry and over the years he worked on many building sites across the North. Despite working long hours, Martin decided he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, William, and join the local fire service. In , at the age of , Martin joined the local station as a part-time firefighter and said he was ‘proud’ to have worked alongside his late father for a few years prior to his retirement. Recalling his time there, the -year-old says he has many fond memories. “I really enjoyed it and I wore my unorm with pride. I can definitely say I gave it %. I definitely think we made a dference to people’s lives. We gave up our time to do that and we weren’t getting paid for it,” he said. “At that time, I was working as well soyou got the call to an emergency you just had to drop all and go.” Over the years, Martin says there were ‘many good days and many bad days’ working as a firefighter. “We attended a lot of accidents and a lot of fatalities over the years and I’ve seen many things that I’ll never forget. At that time, we would have attended a fatality and then had toto our work after it without getting counselling straight away. The things I witnessed I’ve never talked about and have always kept it to myself. It was tough,” he recalled. However, for Martin, who retired from NIFRS in  after  years’ service, the toughest point in his career came following the tragic death of fellow firefighter and friend, Joe McCloskey. The -year-old Dungiven man, who was also a part-time firefighter, died in a blaze at the Gorteen House Hotel in Limavady on Halloween night . “Joe was  per cent. He was loyal and such a decent person who lived for the fire brigade, and unfortunately died for it,” said Martin. “At the time of his death I was off-duty due to an injury and his death really, really upset me. Joe wasn’t just a colleague he was also a really good friend and I was the best man at his wedding, so we were close. We both went into the fire service at the same time. Dungiven lost a true fire fighter when Joe died,” he added. Not long after joining the fire service, Martin’s fellow colleague, Lenny Maguire, set him up on a blind date. Luckily for Martin, it turned out to be love at first sight, and after several years of courting, he went on to marry his blind date, a young woman called Bernie, from nearby Claudy. Martin and Bernie went on to have three sons together – Christopher, Sean and Stephen. Here they are pictured together.  Sadly, Bernie passed away in  following a hard-fought battle with cancer. “Bernie was such a good person. She was quiet and there was no bother or fuss with her. She was such a kind person and she worked hard in Desmond’s Factory in Claudy for many years, but she got it hard and she suffered with her sickness. We really miss her so much,” he said. Martin, who is well-known for his charitable spirit, says his fundraising all began back when he worked as a part-time firefighter. “Back then we would have done a lot of fundraising for the likes of Children in Need and I suppose that’s when it all started,” he said. Martin also volunteers to steward at many community events and funerals and in the recent past has helped to distribute food hampers to those less fortunate in the community. “I never thought I’d see the something like a global pandemic in my letime, but I think Covid- has been like a wake-up call for the world and people have come to learn to appreciate what they have more. There are many people out there who have been badly affected by it all and it’s been so tough on them. “I like helping other people. I want to do it for them, not for me,” said Martin, adding: “I always put others first before me because I like to see a smile on people’s faces.” Martin’s charity work over the years has not gone unnoticed, with local councillor, Sean McGlinchey nominating him for a community award in . Martin, who went onto win the ‘Spirit of Dungiven’ award for ‘Most Caring Person’, organised by McNicholl’s Eurospar, said he was ‘shocked’. Described as ‘an exceptional and very unique person’, local councillor Sean McGlinchey said: “I’ve never met anyone in this community like Martin and despite everything he’s always smiling and laughing.” Martin said: “I was so surprised when I won the award because I feel there is other people out there who are as good as I am, but I did feel so honoured to win the award. It was really nice to receive it, but I don’t do things for the praise, I do it for the people,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He had worked for many years as a bus driver in the city. In this article, his former colleagues at Ulsterbus pay tribute to their friend. Its amazing how so few weeks can have a big impact on a workplace. Earlier this month, Ulsterbus in Derry lost one of its most respected drivers. Joe was a great friend, work colleague and confidante to us all. As a bus driver, Joe was kind and helpful to his passengers and this was also extended to any new starts who needed a helping hand. Also as a shop steward with Ulsterbus, it has to be said that Joe got many of us out of a few sticky wickets in his time. googletag.cmd.push Joes loss will be immense to his work colleagues but to his greatest love of all his we and children. Their loss is immeasurable. Joes we, Joanne, and children, Joseph, Sean and Aine, have lost a great husband and father. Joe had no greater love than that which he had for Joanne and their children, although they would tell you that Fulham FC would have run them close. Joe absolutely adored Joanne and he was so proud of his children and grandchildren. Joe was very much an out-doorsy type of guy. He loved playing football and riding his moped. He was also a keen cyclist and a very keen hiker.Joe would claim to have scaled most of Irelands highest peaks. googletag.cmd.push As with all things Joe did, his commitment and fight knew no bounds. He gave his all against the illness which finally took him, but Joe OHagan will always be remembered as a man of great love, great passion and for simply being a great man. God rest you, Joe, and our thoughts and prayers are with your family and friends. You will be greatly missed by us all at Ulsterbus.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They recorded the fastest time lting the sandbags on the first event, Sole Survivor, before winning the three-way race in Fast and Furious to avoid the eliminator and book their spot in the last eight. It keeps their hopes alive of becoming Irelands Fittest Family. Michael Doylewas joined on the team by his daughter Aoe , sons Ciaranand Niall . “We always saw it when we were younger and thought wed do that sometime,” Niall told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “Then, it popped up on Aoes social media and said enter now, so she clicked on it and then told us we were entered,” he laughs. The family shot videos of themselves performing runs, long jumps, the plank and a range of fitness tests. The coaches trawled them all before making their selections. “We got a phone-call to tell us we were on the show, we couldnt believe it. God knows how many families entered it,” Niall said. While his children had their ious GAA training sessions to keep them in shape, Michael was taken under their wing to get him primed for action, running the roads and practicing lting work around the family farm. googletag.cmd.push Sunday was the third of four heats, filmed at the Killruddery Estate in Wicklow, with two families going through on the night to the next round. “We had no clue what we were getting into,” Niall admits. The family had toyed with the idea of nominating their father to head up into trees to be the sole survivor with his joinery background of walking around roofs and wall plates. But Anna Geary had other ideas. “She said Aoe would do really well and told us the girls have done welland Da would be of more benefit lting bags so it made sense,” Niall reveals.     It left their sister to balance on a beam, saying her Hail Marys while the others slogged it out below on the forest floor. Niall said moving the sandbags was definitely the toughest part of the day. Coach Anna Geary helped the Doyles to crack Sole Survivor  “You have kg on each arm and they are sagging down each time you move. They are bouncing as you are running and the arms are getting pulled out of you.” When it got to event two, the Fast and Furious, the tactics came into play again and Niall was nominated to run last, with little rest time before his second run. The fastest team back on top of the straw bales would avoid the eliminator. “They agreed I was suited best, so I went last and had to run again, so I had to pace myselfso I wouldnt be burned out for the second one,” Niall points out. “When you are running back up the hill, you are wonderingsomeone is catching you. You are always going as hard as you can and conscious of everyone.” In the end, they were first home and avoided the lottery of the eliminator. “It feels amazing and there are so many things going through your head,” he added, thinking of the feeling as the final member of the family climbed to the top of the bales. “At the start we only thought about getting over the first event and not being eliminated. Anna saidwe got over it wed be grand.” Irelands Fittest Family continues with the final heat on Sundayon RTE.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Coyle, who scored  goals for the Candystripes, burst onto the scene as a teenager with  goals in his debut season back in  . Still a regular at the Brandywell as a co-commentator with Radio Foyle, the former talismanic forward watched as Parkhouse hit the ground running his first season in senior football in . Then only -years-old, Parkhouse scored  goals in a memorable season for the club which saw them reach the EA Sports League Cup final and qualy for European football. Parkhouse arrived on loan from Sheffield United, and scored in front of a packed Brandywell on his debut against UCD, just one of many highlights for the teenager. As well as scoring twice against Finn Harps on a memorable night in Ballybofey, Parkhouse also scored  in one game against Waterford in the EA Sports Cup semi-final, as well as a goal in the final against Dundalk. googletag.cmd.push He has now ed to the Brandywell on a three-year deal from Sheffield United, and fans are excited to see him replicate his  form, especially after enduring a disappointing season last year, when City’s top scorers were James Akintunde and Walter Figueira, both with four goals apiece. “It’s a good signing,” Coyle agreed. “He had a good signing here two years ago and he proved himself that he’s a good, capable, League of Ireland player. The fact that he’s also a local and he gets the club is a big plus as well. “He was an unknown quantity back then. Nobody really knew much about him. He was raw he was young and he took everybody by surprise. This season is going to be dferent. People will be a bit tuned into the way he plays, but the fact is he’s still young, he’s only , he’s still got a lot of football in him and the fact that he wants to come to Derry and he’s showing that desire and hunger to play here is a massive plus.” googletag.cmd.push Coyle has warned however that the -year-old will need supporthe is to hit the same heights as he did in his debut campaign. In , Jamie McDonagh, Barry McNamee and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe created  assists between them whereas last season the top creators were Walter Figueiraand Colm Horgan, Jack Malone and Ibrahim Meite . “When you’re scoring goals and you’re playing up front, you’re always going to be the man that everybody looks to,” Coyle explained. “You could see it last year that’s where Derry’s problems were. I think everybody is looking for someone to give them that lt.     “People forget though that two years ago he had Junior on one side and Jamie McDonagh on the other, and they provided a lot of ammunition and chances for him. Derry will have to get that kind of player and get a player of the same standard to not just score goals, but to make chances as well.”  Dying breed Coyle also believes that out and out strikers are a dying breed in the League of Ireland over the years, making the signing of Parkhouse a huge plus, as long as the club gets the players to complement that role. “Strikers in the League of Ireland in the last five, six seven years, they’re dwindling, because of the style of play,” he continued. “Even Shamrock Rovers – Aaron Greene and Graham Burke were playing up front for Shamrock Rovers, but they were pitching in goals from everywhere. They were not just relying on centre-forwards. “I think the way the League of Ireland has changed over the last  years or so – it’s great having someone like Parky who might get you  goals a season, but they are few and far between now. Soyou can get players around him who will create chances for him, he’ll win you more points than you’ll lose.” The fact that Parkhouse has signed a three-year deal is signicant for the club and the player and shows a commitment between both parties as the club attempts to rebuild yet again. “The club have come in for a lot of stick over the last couple of years because they have signed so many players on short term contracts,” Coyle pointed out. “The fact that Parky is only  and he has made it known that he wants to go back to England as well, the club are not going to sign him on a one-year deal and then lose him. If he does well, they know there’s a chance they could sell him, so it was a no brainer for everyone at the club to give him a longer deal. “Derry are on a sticky wicket at the minute because you look at Shamrock Rovers and Dundalk, especially Rovers winning their first league, it’s going to be hard for everyone to try and catch them when you see the calibre of players they are signing. Derry have to be shrewd and they have to be wise who they bring in andit means going that wee bit further to give people two- or three-year contracts then they are going to have to do it.”           --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

come up with an investment package and increase enforcement patrols in the Lough Park area of Ballynahinch.Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown has expressed concern about the parkrsquos lack of maintenance and wants the local authority to act.He has appealed to council officials to prioritise the key issues of littering, dog fouling and general upkeep both at the Ballynahinch park and other locations across the district which, he claimed, are falling into disrepair.Cllr Brown said he has been contacted by concerned residents about continuous littering, dog fouling and lack of maintenance which has led to overgrown weeds and fallen trees in the Lough Park area in particular.ldquoI feel there is a real need for local council involvement and increased enforcement of the rules in a bid to discourage this sort of behaviour, he declared.Cllr Brown said he has asked the local authority to increase the number of patrols carried out in this area and to implement improved signage in an attempt to dissuade people from this type of activity.ldquoWhilst I appreciate that the coronavirus pandemic has led to resources being strained, putting a lot of maintenance work on hold, I am hopeful that it can be arranged for a team to clean the area as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoAdditionally, I am committed to my ongoing efforts in calling for the council to invest in facilities at the Lough Park in order to improve it as an amenity for the community in the surrounding area.Cllr Brown said that given the heightened lockdown restrictions it was vital that spaces for outdoor activities, ldquowhich allow everyone to stay fit and look after their mental wellbeing, are free from litter and other debris.ldquoBeing able to spend time outdoors is so important and I feel strongly that our local communities should have access to well maintained parks and playgrounds, he continued.Cllr Brown said the local authority recently supported a Green New Deal motion, explaining that one of its signicant aims includes addressing the litter problem by calling for a recycling bin in every local outdoor space and ensuring a new green space in every district electoral area.He

success were recently sown by a team of volunteers from Phoenix Natural Gas which is working in the resort as part of a poundm investment to bring mains gas to East Down and Lecale to provide home and business owners with an additional element of choice when itcomes to heating their respective buildings.Nearly  fruit trees and more than  spring flowering bulbs have been planted as part of the new orchard project which is designed to provide a place for residents to come together, learn about the environment and grow fresh produce that can be shared across the whole community, resulting in neighbours being more connected and crossing age, religious and social ides.Phoenix volunteers recently gave up their time on one of the coldest and wettest days of the year to prepare the groundworks for the community orchard, working alongside Tullybrannigan resident and orchard organiser Darren Rice.He said that during lockdown, there was great community spirit with people spending more time than ever at home, explaining that the idea was to create a safe and sustainable place where residents could get together and grow together.Darren continued: ldquoAs winter approached and people were moving back to offices away from their local area, we feared we may lose that community spirit so a bunch of us got together within the Covid guidelines and thought lsquowhat is something simple we could deliver that brings people together rsquoldquoA neighbour had wanted to tidy up an area of grass near his house for years which sparked the idea as there were other similar grassy areas that werenrsquot kept as neat and tidy so we thought of a community orchard.Darren added: ldquoWe were really pleased to receive the support of Newry Mourne and Down Council, Bonniersquos Caravan Park, Mourne Heritage Trust and Phoenix Natural Gas to make the community orchard a reality.Over four days, volunteers planted plum, cherry, apple and pear trees as well as elderberry and blackcurrant shrubs.Among the volunteers was -year-old Emily Gargan, who was part of the project from the beginning and is looking forward to tasting the plums and cherries most as Irsquove never had them straight from the tree before.It is hoped the trees will yield some cherries this year, but it will be  before the residents of Kinghill and Tullybrannigan will have their first signicant community harvest.In the meantime, they have installed three benches to allow residents to sit and watch their hard work come to fruition.Phoenix Natural Gas has been supporting communities across East Down as it extends access to the natural gas network to , consumers in the area.Speaking about the importance of giving back to the communities it serves, Jonathan Martindale, the companyrsquos director of business development, said a fundamental element of its business plan is to get active and involved in the communities we connect to the natural gas network.ldquoWe were delighted to help the Kinghill and Tullybrannigan Community Group create a beautul space for residents where they can grow and harvest together and which will be an asset to the community for years to come, he said.ldquoProtecting and preserving the environment is important to us at Phoenix Natural Gas and in addition to the environmental and efficiency benefits householders make when moving to natural gas, we continue to look for opportunities where we can add environmental value to the communities around us..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"

He was Eventing Irelandrsquos leading rider from -, accumulating the most National and International points.Admitting that the coronavirus is not interrupting preparations too much just yet, Joseph said the current period is part of his year. However, the virus has prevented coaches based abroad coming into the yard.March traditionally heralds the start of the eventing season, with Joseph explaining that the Irish teamrsquos plans are geared towards preparing for the Tokyo Olympics.ldquoWe should be involved in a lot of fitness work at this stage in the year for both the riders and the horses, but we are just keeping working away as best as we can, he explained. ldquoI am lucky in that I have good facilities to use at home and can train the horses to a certain extent.But as with all sports stars preparing for the Games, that does not mean things are all plain-sailing for the -year old.ldquoThere are dficulties at the moment obviously, Joseph continued.ldquoNone of us know what the travel situation will be over the next while, and then of course you also have to take into account the problems that Brexit will pose, particularly for our sport and the cross-border basis.Joseph earned his place on the strong quintet team for the London Olympics in  with Electric Cruise and was one of only five competitors to post a clear cross country jumping round, followed by two classy clear show jumping rounds. He was also shortlisted for Rio Olympics in .Born in Mullingar, Co Westmeath, Joseph and his identical twin brother Ciaran were given boots as one of their first presents mdash football boots.The Murphy clan hail from GAA football stock. However when they had enough money saved up in the local Credit Union, they took out a loan to buy their first horse, an Irish sport horse called Hayes.

Josephrsquos first love is hunting but holds a jockey licence, has won at Point to Points and is also a qualied quantity surveyor.ldquoI feel very proud that my work makes me a part of Team Ireland Olympics. When you are working with the horses in the yard, you are part of a much bigger community. It is great when I look at where we started, where Irsquove taken things in my sport now, both for myself and the staff with me, he reflected.ldquoWhen you are competing in big championships and winning events and medals, people only really see that dayrsquos achievement or those few moments. But athletes know the work, the yearsrsquo of work, hours and sacrice that have gone into getting to that moment.ldquoThat is what makes an Olympics special. The training and preparation are a big part of the overall job of success when you get to the Games. As I have said, with the extra time I now have, I can use that to my advantage.Joseph spreads his time based in the UK and Ireland to avail of both countriesrsquo events. He is also a Horse Sport Ireland level two coach and in between riding, he spends a lot of time teaching horses and riders of all levels in Ireland, the UK and America.ldquoThey come to me from everywhere. I do take on a lot of coaching and that can take me all over the world too, as well as the competition side of things. But the lack of travelling over the past year has been a big blow, he admitted.ldquoThe spread of the virus has obviously made that side of things a lot more dficult and has taken a lot away from me. The coaching and mentoring side of what I do is something Irsquom very passionate about.ldquoThe Olympics is one thing, but there is a business aspect to what I do as well. We have a very good system in our yard for how everything works. I have four staff who are very good at what they do. They are very hands on.Reflecting on the past year, Joseph admits it has been very dficult.He continued: ldquoI have two horses that are qualied for Tokyo. Some people have not been as fortunate as me across dferent Olympic sports in that they did not get the time to make their mark to qualy. For that, I have to be thankful and look on the bright side.ldquoOne of the horses that I bought more recently, I did so specically for Tokyo and that was obviously done before we realised that they would be postponed. That was certainly something we did not foresee then.ldquoIn this sport, you plan things to the maximum in the sense that you need all the ingredients at just the right time. Certainly the fact that we have had the schedule changed has not helped us or indeed anyone competing in the sport.Joseph said preparing to compete in the Olympics takes a long time and a lot of planning and, given the impact of the virus, he has had an extra  months to prepare for Tokyo, insisting the mindset has to be that the Games will go ahead this summer and will not be postponed for a second time.He explained: ldquoAs an athlete, you cannot allow that sort of thinking to cloud your mind. It is all about getting things just right for that time. Last yearrsquos postponement is not as much of a negative as you might think. We have really just had to re-group and go again expecting the Games to happen.ldquoAs a sport and for athlete, that is dficult of course. Preparing for these Games for so long has been a huge part of my le,and ultimately what you are striving to achieve. It puts everything  in perspective.ldquoTherersquos a chance of course that they may not happen, but there is always a plan B. I always try to look at things in a positive way. You actually deal with all sorts of things dferently in le when you work with animals. I try to be relaxed as possible about these things.Joseph is very proud that his work makes him a key part of Team Ireland Olympics and that he is part of a much bigger community.He said while people see athletesrsquo moments of glory and indeed their pain at major world events such as the Olympics, they are unaware of the years of training and sacrice that got them to the international stage.For Joseph, it is a lersquos work that only the others competing at such a high level can truly understand.He said the athletes around him know the years of work, hours and sacrice that have gone into getting torsquo that momentrsquo explaining that this is what makes an Olympics so special to compete in.ldquoThe training and preparation are a big part of the overall job of success when you get to the Games.Josephrsquos journey to the top is all the more remarkable given that he was not steeped as in an eventing upbringing and he did not even really entertain the prospect of making his le in the sport until his late teens.ldquoIrsquom originally from a football background and didnrsquot even start riding until I was . It was something I had been interested in for a while before that, but it was dficult to get established, he revealed.ldquoMy twin brother Ciaran is involved in racing too. I always had a huge interest in horses and eventing, but in the early years, the finances werenrsquot there to allow me to explore it more. But I knew there was something in me a passion, a talent and it was something, thankfully, I was able to bring out because I wanted it enough. I suppose you could say the passion came through in the end. If you have that, it will come through.Joseph has also worked on every aspect of his sport and fitness in order to make sure he has that slight percentage of an advantage over competitors mdashthose margins that can make all the dference when it comes to competing at an Olympic level. His extra preparation has included regular work with Ballygowan-based personal trainer Martin Spence.ldquoI identied a few weaknesses in my riding and wanted to change that. That is why I contacted Martin. I couldnrsquot say enough about him in how he has helped me develop my strength more. I go to him three mornings per week and we work on certain key exercises, said Joseph.ldquoHe goes through watching my videos on the horses, seeing which muscle groups need to be worked on for the benefit of that. That is what going to him ultimately is all about mdash helping my riding. Everything I do with him is training that is geared towards improving me in my sport. Joseph also says he is indebted to others who have helped keep his dreams of sporting achievement at the Olympic level on course.ldquoFor many people in sports such as mine, what some might call minority sports, we are so reliant on being able to generate funding. Sports people work so hard on their chosen disciplines, especially when you consider sports such as eventing which are expensive. They are not always the type of sport that is often in the public eye, he said.ldquoIn that sense, I am indebted to the help that agencies like Sport NI have provided me with and am very thankful to the organisation.Joseph added: ldquoNo one who was preparing for the Olympic Games for these past several years could have foreseen what would have happened over the past  months in the world and that the Games would be delayed.ldquoFor now, I am just keeping focused on what I have to do and be ready to achieve it a year later than I had thought I would. That is the only mindset I can have..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"  "},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20Jan2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians blast council decision over sports hub  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillors joined forces on Monday night to ensure that potential development plans for sports facilities at Dunleath Park in the town would remain a Newry, Mourne and Down Council priority.They were angry with an officersrsquo recommendation that a notice of motion on the development of the area be referred to the Downpatrick District Electoral Area Forum, instead of the local authority setting up a dedicated working group to deal with the issue.At a meeting of councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee it was reaffirmed that Dunleath Park was located on a flood plain which could restrict what could be achieved at the site.The area mdash which is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League and other sports clubs mdash has been considered as the potential site for a sports hub in the town, with council officials currently investigating the potential for a walking trail in the park as well.A number of councillors expressed disappointment that the development of Dunleath Park was not going to be given the same priority as the local authorityrsquos development plan for the Albert Basin site in Newry where a working group has been created to oversee the progress of this scheme.Cllr Dermot Curran said Downpatrick a town centre sports facility for young people was needed more than ever, particularly during the coronavirus lockdown.ldquoThere are so many things that could be done for Dunleath Park and I would have thought that a working group was the best way forward, he said, expressing disappointment over the referral of the matter to the DEA Forum.Cllr John Trainor also disagreed with the council recommendation, declaring: ldquoWe have pushed for a stand alone group to explore the feasibility of what can go on at this site.ldquoI would assume that the acreage of Dunleath Park would be similar to Newryrsquos Albert Basin and we should be taking a serious look at it as a town park complex. Many Downpatrick people feel that Dunleath is the townrsquos park for recreation and leisure.He made a counter proposal to establish a working group between council officers and the Downpatrick DEA councillors to progress the issue.Cllr Oonagh OrsquoHanlon said: ldquoIrsquom really disappointed with the officerrsquos report. We need to get the facts about the possibility of putting something on Dunleath Park or not.ldquoTherersquos more to Dunleath that the actual pitches themselves. There is space around the back of Russell Park which is not being fully utilised as a town centre space.ldquoAre we exhausting the possibility of what can be done or just kicking it down the road to the DEA which would not be able to make any actual decisions on it Cllr Gareth Sharvin pointed out that the council recommendation was counter to his original notice of motion brought to the local authority last year.ldquoThe development of Dunleath Park does merit a working group and while a flood risk assessment is being undertaken, thatrsquos great as it will help us identy areas that can be developed, he continued.ldquoThe purpose of the working group is to prepare a shovel ready business case. The DEA Forum does not have the mechanics to get projects to that point.ldquoItrsquos also an opportunity for the council to clearly state to the people of the Downpatrick DEA that the council is doing something for sports and recreating within the town centre.Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, also spoke in support of a dedicated working group being formed by the council.ldquoDownpatrick is the country town of Down and I believe that it shouldnrsquot just be left to ndash no disrespect to them ndash the DEA councillors, he said.ldquoThere should be a working group set up, something similar to the Albert Basin project, where everybody can play a part. Dunleath Park is not just for the people of Downpatrick, itrsquos for the people of the greater Down District area as soccer teams travel from Comber for the summer league.A proposal from Cllr Sharvin, seconded by Cllr Curran, for a working group to be set up to oversee the redevelopment of Dunleath Park will be discussed at the next monthly meeting of the full council in February..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"  "},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20Jan2021-Respected.jpg","title":"Respected clergyman fondly remembered  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to the minister of Clough and Seaforde Presbyterian churches who passed away last week after a battle with cancer.The Rev Adrian Adgerhas been described as ldquoinspirational, a devoted pastor, teaching elder and evangelist and someone who had a contagious smile.Mr Adgerrsquos funeral service mdash conducted by the Rev Brian Smyth who had known him for  years mdash was held at Clough Presbyterian Church last Friday afternoon.Mr Smyth, who is the minister of Trinity Presbyterian Church in Ahoghill, met Mr Adger at the Belfast Bible College in  and they worked together as colleagues at the Belfast City Mission for a number of years. In , he married Adrian and his we Karen.Addressing mourners, Mr Smyth said he was not at the funeral service as a professional minister, but as a ldquoservant of God seeking to do what I know Adrian would have done for me.Educated at Gracehill Primary School, Mr Adger moved to Ballymena Academy and after passing his A-Levels went to Stirling University to study accountancy.In , Mr Adger graduated and ed to Northern Ireland to complete a diploma in financial accountancy at Ulster University in Jordanstown, subsequently becoming a trainee chartered accountant in Belfast.In September , he began a three-year Diploma in Theology course at Belfast Bible Collegein Dunmurry with Mr Smyth enrolling on the same course.ldquoAlmost immediately we clicked and became best friends, he said.ldquoWe started to pray together and only now has that come to an end. Almost  years have passed since we first met and that friendship has been so wonderful and I will miss my best friend so very much.The two men graduated from BCC in June  and in the autumn BCC took over the work of the Woodvale Mission Hall in Disraeli Street and were looking for a missionary with Mr Adger filling the post.In the summer of , he moved from the Woodvale district to serve in the Fairview Road Hall in Newtownabbey and in  was on his way to Nigeria for a time where he was excited about the work of Africa Christian Textbooks .Two years later he tendered his resignation to the Belfast City Mission as he prepared to go back to Nigeria for almost six months.In September , Mr Adger began his studies at the Union Theological College and subsequently served as an assistant minister in Ballyclare Presbyterian Church, endearing himself to the people of that congregation.ldquoWhen he became eligible for a Call to become an ordained minister within our denomination once again he was much in prayer, said Mr Smyth. ldquoSeveral approaches were made but he was absolutely thrilled to be ordained and installed as the minister of Clough and Seaforde in June .Mr Smyth said that when his friend was diagnosed with incurable cancer, it also became his wersquos cancer, with both of them walking that dficult road together, describing their faith in Christ as ldquoinspirational.He continued: ldquoYou both kept your eyes on the Lord and you both demonstrated what living for Christ is all about.ldquoYes, it can be easy to follow Jesus when the sun is shining and all things are going well but when the dark clouds of Godrsquos providence gather round us it can be a dferent matter. However, it didnrsquot change Adrian or Karen and resolutely they kept the faith and shared Jesus with everyone they met. Many consultants and nurses heard the gospel from this fearless man of God.Mr Smyth said his friend was diagnosed with incurable cancer in November  but rather than relaxing and taking it easy, ldquohis ministry moved up yet another gear.He added: ldquoWe are so glad that Adrian knew Jesus as his personal Lord and Saviour. I pray you will hear the call of God today just as Adrian did and know Christ as your personal Saviour..prettyPhoto.jpg\" alt\"\" width\"\" border\"\"  "},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12013611.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But in Northern Ireland there is always sensitivity over the use of the army in such situations, and so they did not fulfil the same role here.

Foolish talk from him and others undermined the more considered critiques of lockdownThe hospitals are full in Northern Ireland, where coronavirus infection levels have surged — as indeed they have done in all the regions on these islands.Covid’s forceful winter reappearance has happened across Europe.Sweden, which seemed for much of  to have adopted a fair balance between containment of the virus and minimising harm in other walks of le, is not looking so good.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

This is impossible once case numbers pass a certain level.When the history of this time is written, those nations will probably be seen to have handled the pandemic the best.Yet while that is very likely, it is not yet certain.This is because sensible and thoughtful lockdown scepticism has not yet been shown to be groundless.However, such scepticism is greatly damaged by the lunatic fringe of lockdown sceptics.This includes the rubbish talk that Covid- is just like a bad year of seasonal flu, when it was obvious from Italy in February that it was far worse than that.It has been clear since then, or certainly since late March, that the damage done by coronavirus falls relentlessly with age until, at the level of a pre-teen child, death in a car crash is far, far more likey than from Covid. But even so, as the prime minister’s experience showed, the virus hits people under the age of  in ways that seasonal flu does not.Intensive care doctors said early on that Covid attacks the lungs in ways they had never seen before. The severity of symptoms in some cases was also knownway back, in March. Even people who missed such reports cannot have failed to notice that Boris Johnson, then aged only , was fighting for his le in early April.That was before we learned about the damage of long Covid.Lockdown scepticism is further damaged by the ludicrous conspiracy theories about global plans to control people.And by the idiocy of the former president of the United States, Donald Trump, and his chaotic response to the crisis, and his dangerous talk about disinfectant.But sensible sceptics accepted from day one that Covid was very serious. They also accepted that lockdown is highly effective in stopping a virustaken to extremes .The only question was whether the effect of the cure was worse than the disease.As said above, at present it seems not. It seems that the cure was appropriate, and perhaps not administered severely enough. This will be even more so , as the prime minister said yesterday, the mortality rate in the new iant is worse than before. It will be sothe reports of larger numbers of young people in hospital are a sign of a worsening mortality rate in the under s .But look at some of the other stories that we report today, about resumption of cancer surgeries. Think about that! Cancer surgery was cancelled, a quite remarkable state of affairs, often affecting people far below the median Covid death age of  .Or consider the story about further exams being cancelled.Or the story on page  about the decline in the mental health of older people. I was talking to a woman who works in Alzheimer’s this week and she said that she had seen a sharp rise in deaths, hastened she thinks be lack of contact.We will not know for years, or perhaps ever, the full toll from lockdown: the domestic violence, the chronic loneliness, the ruined jobs, ruined industries, the despair caused by lost jobs, the damage done to education and so on.We seem to have become used to such privileged and safe lives in the western world that we seem unable to accept that there are some situations which arise in which there will be very large numbers of deaths whatever we do.And this might be one of those grim situations: that pursuing lockdown causes immense suffering and heartbreak and death but letting the virus rip does too.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: It is only because NI is so cowed by grievance mongering that army help in pandemic is in doubt——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMore than one hundred homes were flooded in the village, with Cardf Road at Eastbrook in Dinas engulfed by water on December , as well as Sunncroft Lane, Millbrook Road, St Lythans Close, Murch Road and Greenfield Avenue.Residents of  homes which were particularly wrecked by floodwater throughout the evening have now written to the Vale council and Natural Resources Wales in a bid to find answers.In the letter they say they felt ldquolet down by ious authorities.ldquoNo help was provided apart from the fire service, the council was directing residents to Barry to get sandbags ndash but the roads were flooded and gridlocked, and residents were dealing with the immediate flood warning alert.Dinas Community Council questioned whether the drains had been properly cleared prior to the floodingConcerns have also been raised about drains not being maintained properly for \"at least a year\", which residents believe contributed to the amount of floodwater.Many residents have now moved upstairs in their homes , while others have been instructed theyrsquoll need to vacate their properties ndash some for up to  months ndash while repair and safety works take place.Resident and councillor Stephen Grfiths, who lives on Greenfield Avenue and whose home was also flooded ndash praised the community for its ldquofantastic spirit after more than pound, was raised to help those affected.Recounting the day of December , he said: ldquoIt was raining pretty heavily but didnrsquot seem anything out of the ordinary.ldquoI certainly didnrsquot expect my house to flood. Irsquove been here for eight years and itrsquos never happened before.ldquoIt was at pm when I realised the drains were backing up ndash not long later the water started coming in and within minutes it was up past our ankles.Mr Grfiths has been able toto his home ndash but he believes it will be months before hersquos back to normal.ldquoChristmas wasnrsquot a great time thatrsquos for sure. We just spent it cleaning and drying the place out. A lot of work needs doing.Stephen Grfiths home on December Cllr Chris Franks said the Vale council and Natural Resources Wales ldquowent missing on the day and the response up to now ndash he says ndash has been abject.Dinas Powys Community Council will begin their own inquiry into how so many homes were flooded, and said they will be meeting virtually with Natural Resources Wales this week.ldquoWe donrsquot believe the stream has been dredged for a long time, which could have added to the levels of floodwater, Cllr Franks said. ldquoNo sandbags were delivered to residents, drains are yet to be unblocked even though complaints have been made, and street lights are still not working since the flooding.Tim England, operations manager for flood and water management for Natural Resources Wales said: ldquoOur thoughts are with those affected by the flooding over the Christmas period at the end of what was a year of exceptional weather events.ldquoSeveral days of intense heavy rainfall in the lead up to Christmas left ground saturated, drainage systems overwhelmed and caused several rivers to overtop.ldquoWe are now working with local authority partners to assess the sources of flooding at the locations affected across south Wales, to investigate what happened and to identy any steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of it happening again.ldquoOnce all the information is gathered, we will be in a better position to inform those affected of what actions are possible.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesperson said:ldquoThe Council wouldfirstly wish topass on its sympathy to those residents affected.ldquoThis excessive rainfall resulted in many drain gullies becoming partially or fully blocked with silt and debris.Also a large number wereunable to disperse flood water as they feed into rivers and watercourses that were themselves overflowing.The community coming together to help residents at Sunnycroft Lane. Picture: Sally WalshldquoThe council routinely cleans gullies, and this last took place on December , just over a week before the heavy rainfall arrived. We are now allocating extra resources to inspect and where necessary cleanse all highway drainage in areas affected by flooding. There will also be an investigation into the flooding, carried out in partnership with NaturalResources Wales and Dwr Cymru.ldquoTo help support residents affected by flooding, the council provided over  sandbags and around  full-sized builders skips to help dispose of water-damaged furniture, floor coverings and other household items. We also provided regular updates on the situation through social media and the council website.ldquoThe council routinely repairs faulty streetlights, whether they have been damaged by flooding or any other cause. An assessment of damage caused by flooding has also now been carried out and further repairs will take place shortly.ldquoReports of any faulty streetlights should be made to the councilrsquos contact centre so appropriate action can be taken. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIN our bridge improvers sessions, we are continuing to deal with opening two bids, playing Benjy Acol.Here is a hand with a big point count that requires careful bidding to reach the right contract.The AuctionNorth has a hand with twenty-three points. So, playing Benjy Acol, North opens two diamonds. This shows at least nine tricks in hand or a balanced twenty-three points plus. It is forcing to game. Her partner, South, with only four points bids two hearts, which asks North, her partner, to show what she has. With a balanced hand North bids two no trumps. South now knows that between them they have more than the magic twenty-five points required to play three no trumps.But hold on a minute, whatNorth has five hearts  Four hearts would then surely be a better contract than three no trumps. So, as with last weekrsquos hand, the correct bid by South is now three clubs - five card puppet Stayman - asking Northshe has a four or five card major. North bids three hearts, showing her five-card heart suit. South now bids four hearts, as she knows that they have eight hearts and at least twenty-seven points between them. This is indeed the best contract, as three no trumps makes, but not so many tricks on a spade lead.The playEast begins with the queen of spades. North as declarer looks carefully at the hand before winning this trick with the king in dummy. She realises that this was the only way to dummy to be able to take the heart finesse. Remember - eight ever nine never is the rule. In other words, with eight cards between you in a suit the percentage play is to take the finesse. But with nine cards between you, the percentage play is usually to play the ace and then the king to try and drop the queen. So, declarer at trick two plays the two of hearts from dummy, playing the jack from her hand to execute the finesse.This wins, as West has the queen. North then plays the ace of hearts followed by the king, removing all the opponentsrsquo trumps. The odds for a   break are good, % in fact. Declarer then plays the king of diamonds from her hand. West holds up his ace of diamonds for two rounds, until declarer has played the king and queen, overtaking the third diamond with his ace. West does this in case declarer has a losing club, which could be discarded on dummyrsquos jack of diamonds.East has played first the three and then the five of diamonds, indicating he has three cards in that suit. We will see next week how he would have played his diamondshe had four cards in this suit, using what is known as a Peter. West then plays his ace of clubs, and it is all over, North winning the rest of tricks with the ace of spades, the remaining trumps, and the king and queen of clubs. So, she makes her contract of four spades with an overtrick,  tricks in all ndash two spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs.Well bid and well played. Without the use of puppet Stayman North would probably play in three no trumps. On the lead of the queen of spades this only makes nine tricks - two spades, five hearts and two diamonds. Declarer takes the heart finesse and plays all her hearts. Then, she plays the king and queen of diamonds, West winning the third diamond with his ace, having refused to take the king or queen. West would thenthe ten of spades, which would be won by declarerrsquos ace. But when she plays the king of clubs, West pounces with his ace and plays the nine of spades, which wins, followed by Westrsquos last spade won by Eastrsquos queen, East West making four tricks ndash two spades and two aces, East having to discard one of his spades on the preceding tricks.What have we learnt . As we saw last week, five card Puppet Stayman, after the opening bidder has shown a strong two no trumps, is vitalyou are to find either a   of   fit in one of the majors. lsquoPuppetrsquo has sunk into bridge jargon over the past forty-five years. The convention was originally invented by Neil Silverman and developed in the s by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson, all American players. As well as finding a   fit in a major, -card puppet Stayman has the advantage that,there is a   fit, the person with the strong hand plays the contract, and the lead comes up to him.. Always take care to take the first trick in the right handyou want to take a finesse.. Sometimes it is advisable to hold up an ace, particularly in no trumps, to block your opponents from entering the hand with winners in it.Penarth club newsPeter Sampsonrsquos ladder competition continues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAnd his senior Welsh Conservative colleague - chief whip Darren Millar MS - has also resigned from his front bench role over his part in the incident.Mr Davies - MS for Preseli Pembrokeshire - had faced calls from within the party to step down as leader after news of the controversy broke last week, but only yesterday he had announced his intention to remain in post.But in a statement released this morning, he said he believes his actions are becoming \"a distraction\".\"Yesterday I indicated to the Conservative group in the Welsh Parliament that I wished to resign, but they urged me to reflect further, and we agreed to meet again on Monday.\"However, for the sake of my party, my health and my own conscience, I simply cannot continue in post.ldquoTherefore, I am stepping down as Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Welsh Parliament with immediate effect.\"ASenedd investigation concluded yesterday that Mr Davies and other politicianswho drank alcohol in the Senedd last month may have breachedcoronavirusrestrictions.As well as PaulDavies, Labour MS for Blaenau Gwent Alun Davies, Welsh Conservative chief whip Darren Millar and the partyrsquos chief of staff Paul Smith consumed alcohol in a Senedd tea room.The incident happened on December , four days after a ban on the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol on licensed premises came into force n Wales, although off-licences were allowed to sell alcohol until pm.Similar circumstances reportedly arose the following day.Those involved have been referred to the standards commissioner, and the catering firm involved has been referred to Cardf council.In his statement this morning, Paul Davies says:ldquoI am truly sorry for my actions on the th and th December. They have damaged the trust and respect that I have built up over  years in the Welsh Parliament with my colleagues and the wider Conservative Party but more importantly with the people of Wales.ldquoWhilst using the Senedd facilities at all times my colleagues and I maintained social distancing. There was no drunk or disorderly behaviour. We did not have to be escorted out of the building as some reports have suggested.\"What we did was to have some alcohol with a meal we heated up in a microwave, which was a couple of glasses of wine on the Tuesday and a beer on the Wednesday. I broke no actual Covid- regulations.ldquoFor the last  months of the pandemic, I have followed the Covid- regulations to the letter. As with everyone across Wales, I have not seen family members or friends, Irsquove not eaten at my favourite restaurants and, like you, we enjoyed a subdued Christmas compared to other years. I will continue to follow the Welsh Governmentrsquos Covid- Regulations and I would urge everyone to play their part in defeating this virus so that we can allto normality.ldquoMy priority as Leader of the Welsh Conservative Group in the Welsh Parliament has always been to bring the Conservatives into government in Wales. Our main focus as the Welsh Conservatives must always be on challenging and removing a failing Labour government.ldquoI am grateful for the support of colleagues in the Welsh Conservative Party for their support in this dficult time, and especially to my we Julie and my Senedd colleagues who have offered empathy, trust and advice. They have treated me with the same courtesy and decency I hope I have always extended to others.ldquoOver the last couple of days, I have been speaking with colleagues in the Senedd and the wider Conservative Party. Whilst they have confirmed they do not wish to see me step down, I believe that my actions are becoming a distraction from holding this failing Welsh Labour-led Government to account, not just on their roll out of the Covid- vaccines but from more than  years of their dither, delay and failure.\"Yesterday I indicated to the Conservative group in the Welsh Parliament that I wished to resign, but they urged me to reflect further, and we agreed to meet again on Monday. However, for the sake of my party, my health and my own conscience, I simply cannot continue in post.ldquoTherefore, I am stepping down as Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Welsh Parliament with immediate effect.ldquoIt is for the group to decide how best to choose a new leader, but I hope that process will be seamless and speedy, and I pledge my support to whoever becomes leader.Mr Millar - MS for Clwyd West - also issued a statement, referring to \"a dficult week\".ldquoI want to apologise to my family, colleagues and constituents for any embarrassment that some of the media stories may have caused in recent days,\" he said.ldquoThere have been some wildly inaccurate and unfair reports so I want to set out the truth.\"As has been the case in most weeks since September when the Hybrid Senedd was sitting in Cardf Bay, on both the th and th December last year I used the self-serve catering arrangements that were made available for Senedd Members. On both evenings I served myself a pre-ordered, pre-prepared meal that was reheated in the microwave and ate it while drinking an alcoholic beverage and discussing work matters with colleagues.ldquoSocial distancing was maintained throughout these working dinners and it simply did not occur to either me, my colleagues or the catering team that the arrangements may have been inappropriate.ldquoThere was a member of catering staff present in the tea room for a short time after my arrival on the th December but she did not serve me a drink, nor did I request one. In fact, I encouraged the member of staff to go home and close up the counter as it had been a long day for her. No members of catering staff were present on the th December and the counter was closed for the whole evening.ldquoWhile I am advised that I did not breach coronavirus regulations I am very sorry for my actions, especially given the impact of the tough restrictions that people and businesses are enduring.ldquoFor this reason, and given that Paul Davies has resigned as Welsh Conservative Group Leader in the Senedd, I have decided to step down from my front bench role in the Welsh Parliament.ldquoI am cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and will continue to do so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So on th Dec , the ABC Positivity group page was created.“In November  I suffered from work-related stress and was off work for three months. With guidance from my GP and a counselling service I was able to recover and manage any future mental health problems. I feel this has helped me understand what some people are going through and this is “my” way of trying to help.“I have received some amazing encouragement and responses from the public. Within a couple of weeks I had over  members and now I have over ,.“The response has been overwhelming.“I also would like to thank members of all parties in Armagh Banbridge and Craigavon Council who have private messaged me with words of encouragement or offering me helpneeded. Some of the council members have even shared the page whilst also participating in posting messages and pics etc.“I have got ious messages publicly and privately. One lady said: ‘It’s lovely being part of a group where everyone is on the same page and people are supporting and caring online, rather than tearing each other apart.’ “Another member said: ‘I want to say a big ‘thank you’ for starting this page. I was at an all-time low leading up to and during Christmas. Now I feel like a spring chicken, and ready to face whatever. Each post I read boosts me up more and more’.” Paul said: “These comments were special and struck a chord with me. It showed me that my idea was working and that there was positivity out there and helping those in need.”After his own recovery from mental health issues, the -year-old decided to get out and about more. “I love getting out on my mountain bike and also purchased a drone. I now love getting out at any opportunity and try to get amazing pictures from dferent areas,“I completed my drone pilot license in December  and have another Facebook page called “Blackbox Aerial Photography”.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Chief Inspector Gerard Pollock from Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Contact Management Centre says the public often ring ‘’ to get in touch with an officer about an incident they’ve already reported, or to obtain an incident reference number. Chief Inspector Pollock explains: “We want to make it easier to contact the officer dealing with your incident by consistently providing that information up front and in a timely way.” In January, the first phase will roll out for online reports. The second phase roll-out will be for  calls and over-the-counter reports. It’s hoped this will start later in Spring . “Currently, we advise anyone who makes a report online whether police will be attending or not by email when we receive a report, and the incident reference number,” explains Chief Inspector Pollock. “However, we will be introducing new feedback to include details of the attending officer and how to get in touch, details of how to contact your local neighbourhood policing team and key crime prevention tips to help keep you safe from crime in the future. “This provides a simple and clear record of your report to the Police Service along with key details should you need to get in touch about the incident. The key here is making the attending officer more accessible to the public, while also using that as an opportunity to deliver timely crime prevention advice to reduce their risk of becoming a victim of crime in the future.” Chief Inspector Pollock recognises not everyone has, or uses e-mail, and says officers will still contact people by phone. However, we have seen a growing trend in  of people going online to report incidents with a % rise on , he explains. During our current online reporting process you have a choice to provide your email address and overwhelmingly the public choose to do so, so that’s why we’re starting with online reports. For those who do provide an email address during the process they will receive the officer’s email address and work mobile number which they can use to contact them. “Policing is   and our officers work a range of shts,” says Chief Inspector Pollock. “That often means it can be a number of days before they are on duty at an appropriate time to call someone to provide an update. In order to keep our victims updated we want to ensure we use all the resources available to us, including email.” Chief Inspector Pollock adds: “We see this as an enhancement to our current service options, not a replacement, and we understand some people do not have an email account. So, for those people we will continue to provide those key details via our ‘’ service. However, we also recognise for many people that’s no longer the best way for them, so we’re providing a range of options that meet the needs of our communities.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eebebbfda   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edaabccaebdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1611326623703.jpg--covid_19___fri_22nd_jan_figures.jpg?161132662300","title":"covid  fri nd jan figures ","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.
