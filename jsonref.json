Jones is not much read today – and it’s easy to see why in the unlikely event that you get through From Here to Eternity – but I was curious about The Thin Red Line because of Terrence Malick’s masterly film. Well, the novel is recognisably the source, in that it takes place during the American assault on Guadalcanal in the second world war, but one slowly realises (almost disbelievingly, given the film’s stately cadences) that the book is actually a very violent comedy: “a sort of nonsensical hysteria of cruel fun”, as one officer sees it, more akin to Tarantino than Malick.“Hysteria of cruel fun” is also an apt description of the bonkers world of Ivy Compton-Burnett. In scope (English upper-class households between the wars) and form (almost entirely dialogue), novels such as A House and Its Head and Manservant and Maidservant get by on the most meagre of narrative rations. Imagine the Wodehouse books, with Jeeves and Wooster stranded at the precise moment, in Gaspar Noé’s Climax, when the cast begin to notice that the punch has been spiked. Since this dread realisation can be expressed only within the clipped register of class and period, a tightly repressed mania holds sway. Relief takes the form of howls of laughter from the reader.One of the funniest books of the past 10 years is by the eminent critic Terry Castle. The Professor and Other Writings includes the scandalous memoir of her friend Susan Sontag, whose unremitting seriousness led Castle to perceive her as a great comic character. The long title piece is a side-splitting account of a tragic affair with a professor when Castle was a student in the 1970s, back in the days when the application process for a fellowship included getting catatonically stoned.Speaking of sex, drugs and California, Slow Days, Fast Company is the best book by Eve Babitz, who seemed to get high – often in bed – with practically everyone in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 70s. At one point in this collection she ends up in Palm Springs in the company of thinly altered versions of Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner and his wife. The house where they’re staying is such a sleek celebration of modernism that the sliding doors leave one of the guests longing for doorknobs.Having started with film, let’s end there, too, via a poem by Billy Collins. Poets have long taken solace in the belief that their work is so good that nobody in their right mind would ever want to read it. And then along comes Collins, whom everybody adores and whose books sell in chimney-height stacks because, as well as being wise, tender and clever, they’re so funny. The fact that the poems are often about dogs doesn’t do any harm, either. “The Revenant”, in Aimless Love, is a monologue from a dog who, having been put to sleep, returns from the dead to tell his grieving master just one thing: “I never liked you.” It seems that Alejandro Iñárritu took a lot of liberties with the film version.• Geoff Dyer’s books include Out of Sheer Rage  (Canongate)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ddf65204691be40ee6f871355a5f77339e39c93/0_1708_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6797c934c2b2a927cdddbf7413d70416","title":"sally rooney i want the next thing i do to be the best thing ive ever done","story":"The Normal People author on the joy of Jeeves and the influence of JD Salinger’s Franny and ZooeyThe book I am currently readingMargaret Drabble’s 1972 novel The Needle’s Eye. This is only the third of Drabble’s books I’ve read, and I’ve admired them all. I’m living in a fairly remote rural area at the moment with no internet access, and now that the bookshops are closed, I’m working through my accumulated back catalogue of unread novels.The book that changed my lifeI think all my favourite books have changed my life in one way or another. Last year, Emmanuel Carrère’s book The Kingdom (translated by John Lambert) set me off on a path of reading and thinking that I’m not sure I would have ventured down otherwise.The book I wish I’d writtenI don’t tend to wish I had written other people’s books. It would take the fun out of being a reader. I would like to write something as good as James Joyce’s Ulysses, for sure, but I don’t think I want to have written Ulysses itself, no.The book that had the greatest influence on my writingThe honest answer is probably JD Salinger’s Franny and Zooey. I read it maybe once too often in my youth.The book that is most underratedIt would not be exactly correct to call the Gospels underrated, but I often think people are not as familiar with those interesting texts as they might presume themselves to be.The book that changed my mindIt’s a sad truth about my mind that it is a very hard thing to change. Lots of books have introduced me to new information and new ways of thinking, but I can’t remember one that has really reversed my opinion on anything. I’m sorry to say that if I thought a book had a chance of changing my mind, I suspect I might not read it.The last book that made me cryI recently shed a little tear at Philip Wakem’s letter to Maggie Tulliver near the end of George Eliot’s The Mill on the Floss. (That was one of the back catalogue too).The last book that made me laughPG Wodehouse’s The Inimitable Jeeves – the story “The Purity of the Turf”, in which Bertie is consulting Jeeves as to whether to lay a bet on the forthcoming Girls’ Open Egg and Spoon Race at the annual village school treat. Jeeves advises that last year’s winner is an odds-on favourite. “They tell me in the village that she carries a beautiful egg, sir.”The book I couldn’t finishThomas Hardy’s Tess of the D’Urbervilles. I just didn’t like it. I don’t know why! Maybe I’ll try again another time.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readI’m not really ashamed that I haven’t read Tolstoy’s War and Peace or Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. But I probably will feel a bit more contented once I have read them, which I hope will be soon.The book I give as a giftI try to choose gifts with an eye to what the recipient might like to receive, so there is no universal answer to this question. For the aesthete, however, Teju Cole’s beautiful Blind Spot is hard to beat.The book I’d most like to be remembered forI don’t think I care much about being remembered, really. I never think about it. But like anyone, I always want the next thing I do to be the best thing I’ve ever done.My earliest reading memoryWhen I was very young I was given a book based on the Disney film Aladdin. Down the side of the pages was a plastic attachment with a series of buttons on it, each of which made a different noise when pressed. That’s the first book I remember reading.My comfort readAll the Jeeves books, as above, and all of Jane Austen’s novels, especially Emma.

When it comes to good writing, we can tend towards a romantic vision of it being an unexplainable, inimitable act of ine intervention. It can be inspiring – and often unpalatable – to be reminded that the best writing is more often the result of of hard and constant work.Even if the last thing you are planning on doing in lockdown is writing a novel, here are some of the best guides on writing: how to do it, how it works and how to be inspired to start. There were plenty of books that did not make this list that I would still recommend as entertaining, stirring and useful for would-be writers, such as The Writer’s Chapbook (a collection of advice given by authors in the Paris Review, which seems to be out of print now), Tillie Olsen’s Silences (important but not stuffed with practical advice) or Annie Dillard’s The Writing Life (ditto). And as any successful writer would say, the best thing you can do to learn how to write is read, read, read. But it couldn’t hurt to try a few of the following, too.Who better to learn from than a man who went from living in a trailer park to being one of the bestselling authors in the world? While some of King’s advice could be considered common sense (write every day, don’t presume to be smarter than your readers, read more), the details of King’s own life (alcoholism, car accident), his punishing schedule (2,000 words a day) and his no-nonsense humour (“The road to hell is paved with adverbs”) make this a very readable guide. So many authors credit On Writing as being instrumental in becoming a paid writer.Another classic of the genre. Lamott – an author and creative-writing teacher – focuses on the inherent value of writing, even if it is never shared with anyone, never published, or never makes money. The lessons she shares with her students, who “kind of want to write but really want to be published”, are refreshing – such as the maxim that all good writers write “shitty drafts”. There are good practical exercises, too.A relatively new addition to the genre by the Booker-winning author, who recalls anecdotes from his colourful life (“hellraiser” is an apt description for Pierre) to explain the intricacies of good storytelling. There are some real gems (his tale of finding children living in the attic of his family home is astounding) and there are some tips you won’t get elsewhere, such as: “Weed is a writerly drug … it is the drug of choice for staring at a blank page and watching stories grow out of tangents.”Just as journalists such as Hunter S Thompson and Tom Wolfe pioneered the flashy, challenging and sometimes infuriating “new journalism”, McPhee was shaping an equally influential form of nonfiction while writing for the New Yorker: quieter, equally literary, blending fastidious accuracy with novelistic storytelling. This collection of essays is warmly reassuring and instructive, and worth buying for the essay called Structure alone, in which McPhee explains how he plans long and complex nonfiction works.Yes, there is more than a whiff of spiritual cheesiness in this guide to “recovering your creative self” – Cameron uses “God” as a stand-in for creative energy, which might ruffle some atheists – but it has helped everyone from Elizabeth Gilbert to Martin Scorsese. Several authors I have spoken to swear by some of Cameron’s exercises, particularly “morning pages”: handwriting three pages of stream of consciousness before tackling any work, in order to get the day-to-day baggage out of your mind and focus on creative thinking instead.Last year, I met the Let the Great World Spin author and he immediately began nudging me to write a novel. Whether it was the wine or sheer politeness, I was intrigued to meet an author who seemed so buoyed by the possibilities of other people’s writing – so when I heard about this book, I had to buy a copy. Broken up into 52 short pieces on everything from opening lines to procrastination, it is not so much a manual as a “word in the ear”, as McCann puts it. Crucially, as a creative-writing teacher, he dispels the notion that you have to have a qualification to become a novelist: “In the end nothing will matter but the words on the page: who cares if they came from an MFA or not?”Having written screenplays including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, and novels such as The Princess Bride and Marathon Man, Goldman could not be a better teacher. While this guide sometimes favours gossipy entertainment over practical advice, authors have said they appreciate its lessons in ruthlessness – and one of the last chapters, titled Before We Begin Writing, is brilliant for writers of all kinds.Cron’s lengthy subtitle – How to Use Brain Science to Go Beyond Outlining and Write a Riveting Novel (Before You Waste Three Years Writing 327 Pages That Go Nowhere) – tell you everything you need to know. She uses neuroscience to explain why certain books keep us up reading into the early hours and why others bore us to tears. No matter how beautiful your writing is, if your protagonist doesn’t have an internal struggle, Cron argues, readers will not care. She then explains how you, a writer, can use that to hook and hold readers and get everything right by draft four or five, instead of 14 or 15.“This is not a book for beginners,” the late, great queen of science-fiction writes at the start of this book and she isn’t one for hand-holding. There is no advice on rejection letters or finding “God” here, or even advice on plotting or characterisation. (If you are after that, you’d be better off with King.) Instead, Le Guin provides useful exercises to encourage writers to improve their work at the sentence level, including one called Chastity: write a page of descriptive narrative prose, without adverbs, adjectives or dialogue.Finally, the grandfather of writing books. Written by the Charlotte’s Web author (White) and his former English professor (Strunk), the duo don’t teach you to kill your darlings so much as massacre them with a big smile on your face. Omit needless words. Avoid a succession of loose sentences. (Read: too many commas.) While some writers would bridle at such concrete edicts on what makes “good writing”, others have credited the book with helping them gain clarity and shed affectation in their writing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16d0a4579e9df28986d8a49e4b7c0084222ce4f/0_84_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f29f4e2cfbcb330796ec6a26b6da65e","title":"us airlines empty planes coronavirus environment","story":"The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air.Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.“The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.”This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people.However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.“You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.”The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.“The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.” A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”."},{"url":null,"title":"have you been affected coronavirus anywhere but westminster","story":"For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you As the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.Do you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

But the truth is, we’re nowhere near controlling coronavirusThere has not been a lot of good news lately. But with the discharge of Boris Johnson from hospital on Sunday, and statements that the “peak” strain on the National Health Service would be over the Easter period, you might be under the impression that the storm is passing, and the Covid-19 pandemic will soon be a memory.Fueling this mood are reports from studies of communities already hit by the pandemic. At long last we are beginning to see the results of work looking for signs that people have already been infected, through the presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. Some of this data suggests strongly that many infections may have passed unnoticed, with the only symptoms being mild things such as loss of the ability to smell and taste, and that as a result, more people may be immune than had been thought. Surely this is a sign that communities around the world can breathe a sigh of relief and start getting back to work?Unfortunately, it is nothing of the kind.Talk of the “peak” can be misleading, because it’s not clear whether you are talking about the Matterhorn or Table Mountain – both have a summit, but the peak is far more pronounced in one than the other. In countries such as Italy (unlike Wuhan) the initial surge in the Covid-19 pandemic has not evaporated quickly. There are multiple reasons for this but the most important is that the impact of physical distancing achieved in China has been hard to accomplish elsewhere, mostly because of the freedoms we correctly value in liberal democracies.Worse, there may be a mountain range. In other words, what is happening right now could be just one peak – not the peak. And the reason for this is that despite all those positive signs from antibody testing, the huge majority of the population is not immune.An editorial in the British Medical Journal has reported data from China suggesting that as many as four in five cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection could be asymptomatic. It then goes on to quote people from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford, who say that if this is true “What the hell are we locking down for?” I wish those people would be brave enough to go and repeat that opinion in an ER in the Bronx right now, in which actual medicine is going on. Worrying about the exact rate of asymptomatic infection, or the currently unknown duration of immunity and a possible “second wave”, is like politely applauding the performance in a jazz club and murmuring “nice” while the building is demolished around you and the piano player gets decapitated.There have been more than 93,000 cases of Covid-19 identified in the UK. Let’s round that up and say it is 100,000. So if the reports from the BMJ editorial are accurate, the actual number would be that multiplied by five, in which case there would have already been half a million infections in the UK. If this really is the peak and we see as many cases on the way down as on the way up, that would total 1 million infections from the initial surge in the UK – hopefully all of those people would then be immune.That would leave about 65 million people in the UK still without immunity.I am going to be unusually optimistic here, and assume that everyone who has Covid-19 becomes fully immune (not a given), and that the virus is towards the less transmissible end of the range of estimates currently available. If this is the case, you would need half your population to have been infected to achieve a level of population immunity that would stop the epidemic continuing to grow and overwhelming healthcare systems. As I write the UK is reporting more than 10,000 deaths from Covid-19. Due to the realities of collecting data during an infectious disease emergency like this, that is likely to be an underestimate. Again, if we assume this is the peak and there is the same number on the way down that’s 20,000 total from the initial surge. And to get to population immunity you have to multiply that by at least 30: based on the current data, that’s about 600,000 deaths to get there, minimum.Finding a vaccine to offer a complete solution to this pandemic is, even in the best scenarios, is still a long way off But it is not hard to see many ways we can slow the pace of the pandemic and save lives. One of them is greatly improved testing to identify cases and their contacts, which could be supplemented by clever digital methods to spot who has been at risk. Governments around the world are attempting ways to keep jobs and businesses afloat while lockdowns are in place – but the pressure remains to swiftly end such shutdowns. I get that this is going to be a mammoth strain on the economy. But the deaths of many thousands of people would be too: it is simply not possible to thoroughly insulate an economy from the impact of a pandemic of this kind.Where I live, in Cambridge Massachusetts, I keep hearing sirens. This crisis is not close to over, quite the reverse.

Well, dream on. Across Europe schools are now tentatively beginning to reopen, at least in countries such as Denmark which locked down earlier than we did German schools too are likely to start returning from early May. But in Britain, it might be half term before that can be considered.Nobody wants schools and nurseries to reopen until everyone is sure it’s safe, obviously. Children seem for the most part only mildly affected by the virus but not immune, and teachers continue to be vulnerable parental physical distancing amidst the general muddle of drop-off and pickup would be a struggle, and once the kids are mingling freely some adults will want to do the same. Yet knowing that there’s no alternative doesn’t make it any easier to earn a living while you’re trying to teach the bus stop method for long ision.For not everyone is charmed by small persons barging gleefully into video calls, and the prejudices some employers have always harboured against working parents haven’t magically disappeared overnight. The charity Working Families reports a spike in demand for its free legal services it’s hearing from women told that if they can’t manage working around their children they should just take unpaid leave, and from pregnant women sacked if they won’t work in risky public-facing roles. The tragic death of a heavily pregnant nurse, Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, is a chilling reminder of the anxieties facing many expectant key workers, although we still cannot know whether she was infected at work or not.Parents worry at the best of times about competing with childfree colleagues who can put in as many hours as it takes, but strip away our childcare and we feel more exposed than ever. This epidemic has been a giant leap back to the dark days before organised childcare families can muddle through for a bit, but in the longer term home-working with kids underfoot is the 21st-century equivalent of Victorian urchins playing under their mothers’ looms in textile mills.Single parents, the vast majority of them women, are as ever at the sharp end of this, and lone parent charity Gingerbread warns that many feel increasingly “alone and overwhelmed”. But dual career couples have their challenges too.Whichever partner chose a job in normal times that seemed flexible around the family is more likely to be slumped over a laptop at 2am now, the classic price paid for stealing time with the kids in the afternoon. And if one of you has to crack and request a furlough, it makes more sense for that to be the lower earner.It’s men who are the most obvious victims of this epidemic, being twice as likely as women to die of coronavirus. Seven in 10 of those ending up in intensive care with Covid-19 are also male, something only partly explained by risk factors like more men smoking. On the economic side, the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds job losses so far have disproportionately hit women, as well as young and low-paid people. That’s no surprise given who tends to work in the pubs, restaurants and shops most directly hit by lockdown, and things may change as other industries start being affected by slumping consumer demand. But the lesson from the aftermath of the banking crash is that ministers were too slow to realise austerity was affecting women differently from men there’s no excuse for making the same mistake this time.Now that four in 10 companies still trading are seeking to reduce staffing levels and over a quarter are cutting hours, ministers should be auditing what’s happening on the ground and using the pulpit of those daily press conferences to warn employers that discrimination law still applies in a crisis.There’s a reason it’s illegal to target women on maternity leave when making redundancies, and it’s that too many bosses try it on at the best of times. Don’t let the worst of times become an excuse for turning back the clock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6f9a639a5d64ad2a0a1cdb4d5c49cc04e08612/0_46_700_420/master/700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c04dd8f76b83fa2ba1044991b3faf39","title":"lecturers condemn durham universitys plan to shift degrees online","story":"The University and College Union (UCU) has condemned plans by Durham University to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The radical redesign of the university’s curriculum, revealed by student newspaper Palatinate, would “invert Durham’s traditional educational model”, based on residential study, with one that places “online resources at the core enabling us to provide education at a distance”.The proposals, drawn up by deputy vice-chancellor Antony Long and vice-provost for education Alan Houston, warned that Durham has been slow to develop online education compared to its competitors, which posed “a very significant financial and reputational risk” to the university.Under the plans, seen by the , some students would only study online, some would be taught on campus, and others would do both. The proposals, drawn up without consulting staff or students, would reduce the number of modules taught in person by a quarter in the next academic year, with the goal of providing at least 500 of them completely online by the summer of 2021.The document, due to be considered by the university’s senate later this month, also proposes contracting a private education firm, Cambridge Education Group Digital, to develop a business case to implement the plans.The UCU said that universities “should not see the global pandemic as an opportunity to try and drastically alter their different business models”, and urged Durham to consult properly with staff and students over any changes.Grady added: “This looks like an attack on the livelihoods and the professional expertise of hard-working staff – all to line the pockets of private providers who don’t have the same track record of providing high standards of education.“Durham needs to halt these plans. The fact there has been no consultation with staff or students is unacceptable and we will continue to defend the quality of education staff provide and our members’ jobs.“Changes to our higher education system should be led by staff from the ground up, whether they are necessitated by Covid-19 or not. We will do everything we can to challenge this and any other similarly destructive proposals.”The university aims to provide its key postgraduate and first-year undergraduate degrees online by October 2020, with a focus on delivering those with the most “international market potential”.Durham UCU branch held a virtual emergency general meeting this week where members “voted to firmly oppose rushed long-term changes taken without proper consultation”.More than 300 Durham academics have also signed a letter to vice-chancellor Stuart Corbridge, describing the proposals as “highly concerning … cynical and reckless”.Prof Antony Long, the university’s deputy vice-chancellor, said: “None of us yet know what the 2020-21 academic year will look like, but we must plan now so that when we do, we have options properly developed and ready to implement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e77cae5e3e78daf7130a3f267b4e70d1a8f99d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e6126b9180154e00ebd12b3f69ec345","title":"home birds how to spot 20 of the most common species from your window walk or garden","story":"Now there’s no traffic noise to drown out their sounds, it’s a perfect time to learn how to distinguish birds by their songsAs our cities, and even parts of the countryside, have fallen eerily silent, with traffic and aircraft a distant memory, many of us have started to notice a new sound: birdsong.Now that spring has well and truly sprung, this is the ideal time to get to know your local birds. Spotting them is one way to identify common species, but why not try learning their songs, too? That’s not as easy as it sounds: rather like learning a foreign language, it can be pretty daunting. But with patience, time and effort, it can be done – just follow these simple steps:1 Sit in your garden if you have one, or take your daily walk, either early in the morning or during the hour or so before sunset, when the volume and intensity of birdsong is at its peak.2 Listen to the bird first then try to get a good look at it, to help you identify the species.3 Use mnemonics (see below) to help you remember which bird makes which sound.4 Focus on only one or two species each day. Then, when you get home, listen to recordings of their songs, and when you go out the next day, try to hear them again.5 As Bill Oddie says, think about the rhythm, tone and pitch of each song: fast or leisurely cross or plaintive high, low or medium pitch?Remember, practice makes perfect – and you’ll never have a better opportunity than now!Sparrow-sized, with a black head, white cheeks, a green back and a black stripe down the front.

Her mother was very ill in a care home at the time. Waldman couldn’t visit her, or see anyone else, because of the lockdown. So she worked from home wearing extraordinary outfits and posting the results on Facebook to “cheer up” her friends.She sent a photograph of herself wearing the dress to the care home where the staff printed it out to show her mother. Tragically, her mother died before she could see it. “It’s a sad story,” says Waldman, “but it is also a happy one in a way, because I have these dresses that she made.” Waldman says she will wear more of her mother’s exquisite creations during lockdown, including the wedding dress her mother crocheted for her, as well as “funny outfits” – such as a flamenco dress – to raise friends’ and colleagues’ spirits, as well as her own.We asked our readers what they were wearing in lockdown. Some of the stories, such as Waldmans’, were more poignant than we could ever have anticipated. Some readers said they were simply relieved to be spending more time in elasticated waistbands. Many readers were using clothing as a means of comfort, distraction and fun.“I always choose clothes that lift my mood,” says London-based sewing teacher and fashion designer Karen Arthur (pictured in main image). “Making an effort helps me to feel a little better.” She made her outfit out of a pair of curtains her friend Ian found in his dad’s attic. Although Arthur’s business has ground to a halt, she is making face masks instead. “I brought my sewing machine and some fabrics home with me just before lockdown was announced, thank goodness,” she says.Many of us might feel a bit Miss Havisham all dressed up home alone, but Arthur is far from alone in dressing brightly at this dark time. “My friends and I have made a pact to wear beautiful long party gowns to the supermarket the next time we shop in Sainsbury’s,” says Rachel Bailey-Hogg, who is a lecturer. “It’s all a giggle and hopefully makes others smile too.”Hen, an events assistant from Bristol (pictured in main image), is another believer. “I’ve been pretty much forcing myself to wear as much bright colour as possible,” she says, “to trick myself into brightening my mood and not feeling quite so scared. It’s been a partial success. I’d describe myself as a fairly bold dresser anyway – I’m known at work for wearing big novelty earrings – so I’m trying to lean into that and make WFH as much fun for myself as I can.”Another vivid dresser, Lizzie, wears a cardigan which recalls the children’s rainbow drawings that adorn windows across the UK. This, she says of her outfit, “is peak work-from-home chic. The skeleton leggings cost a fiver and the bones glow in the dark.”Some readers are using clothing to recreate the rhythms of a normal week. “Getting dressed in the morning motivates us to get up and start the day – as does coffee. It is a small daily ritual that gives us something to look forward to,” say 28-year-old art student twins Becky and Alex Chipkin.Antonia, 38, has instigated “fancy Fridays” for video calls with her colleagues. “It makes Friday morning feel like the evening preparations before going out,” she says. Online, attempts to make Fridays feel special through clothing proliferate, with hashags including #DressUpFriday and #FormalFridays often trending on social media.The popular style blog Man Repeller has struck a nerve with the hashtag #goingnowherebutfuckitimgettingdressed, with almost 7,000 people posting photographs of isolation outfits on Instagram.“For many people, dressing is a survival mechanism and at the end of the day, from the most trivial to crucial corners of the human experience, that’s all any of us are trying to do,” says Leandra Medine, founder of Man Repeller. Her own strategies include a dress code for “date nights” with her husband, in which both parties are “required to get dressed, even put on shoes, to meet in the living room”.That makes sense to psychologist Dr Carolyn Mair. “Not knowing when this lockdown will end really is stressful for us – we feel a lack of control,” she says. “Getting dressed is a form of taking control and structuring our day and reassuring ourselves that we have not lost our value. Routine is hugely important.”Some are dabbling with fancy dress in lockdown. Online, photographs of digital project managers wearing jester hats or archaeologists dressed as Power Rangers in Zoom meetings proliferate. Jo Parry, from Cardiff, has pledged to wear a different costume every day, ranging from Cruella de Vil to Gollum. Ella, a 34-year-old climate change scientist, has been raiding her festival fancy-dress box since lockdown began. “I didn’t want to fall into the trap of spending all day mooching around in pyjamas, so I decided to wear something every day that I couldn’t wear to work,” she says. “It has raised more than a few smiles when I’ve been out for my daily dose of fresh air.”Personal sartorial challenges abound. Some are crafty and intimate: Gina Bennett and Ron Evans have transformed one of Evans’s old T-shirts into a top for Bennett and are now wearing matching outfits for – they insist – the first time ever.Alex Pratchett, from Oxford, a “kit geek” who draws footballers for a living, is alleviating football withdrawal symptoms by wearing “a different football shirt every day until the lockdown ends. If I run out of shirts before it’s over, the virus wins. If nothing else, it will help mark the passage of time, as I was previously struggling to remember which day of the week it was,” he says.Online, creative types whose working lives have stopped abruptly have been using their wardrobes as performance art. Andrew Downs, of the set designers James English Productions, for example, has been wearing vintage clothing to stage baroque, Acorn Antiques-like tableaux for Instagram with his mother and husband. Dressing up, he says, brings “structure. Otherwise you are changing from your day pyjamas into night pyjamas.”But for every person extolling the mood-lifting benefits of dressing as they would have done four weeks ago, there is another revelling in the opportunity to shed their skin.Matt Hepworth, from Bristol, speaks for many in gravitating towards one well-worn item of clothing, in his case a “comfy old raving hoody” because, he says, it “makes me feel young, is warm and I wouldn’t dare ever wear it to work”.Colin, a library assistant in Scotland, is “usually fairly respectfully dressed” at work in a uniform of lilac shirt and smart trousers. The upside of working from home, he says, is getting to wear his favourite band T-shirts. “I wonder if many of the library users would know how much I am into heavy metal, doom metal, heavy rock, grunge and other noisy music genres,” he says.Teacher Emma Leslie is working her way through her wardrobe of casual clothes, which she would never be able to wear at school due to a strict dress code. “It’s not always the most practical thing to be doing but it does help to take my mind off the situation,” she says.Dressing without an audience has proved liberating for many. “My current job is the first place I’ve ever worked where I am out as both queer and non-binary,” says H, a 27-year-old computer programmer. “Working from home has been an interesting experiment as I tend to see connections between my gender and my clothing choices quite a lot. It’s been nice to experiment more with my femininity from the comfort of my own home without the pressures of how I might be perceived by the outside world.” This dress, they say, is a favourite: “It’s super-light and floaty, which puts me in a good positive headspace.”One anonymous 24-year-old says: “I am female, blond, rather petite and have an accent when speaking in English. I was convinced that my appearance decreased my credibility in a rather male-dominated, imposing and English-native environment.” In the office, she says, she was a “power dresser” and saw blazers and heels as a way to appear more “confident and convincing”. After a few days of working from home, “I got more and more comfortable in my casual clothes. I am now receiving calls without video,” which she feels has “balanced out the power dynamics”.Jogging bottoms have never seen so much action. In these unanchored times, even US Vogue editor Anna Wintour has been photographed wearing them. Jyoti, who lives in London, says: “I’m always having to think about that top half people would see on teleconferences but, unless I have to stand up, no one knows what lies under that top half. It’s going to feel weird to go back to smart trousers.”But do clothes really help lift our spirits? Carolyn Mair, believes so, citing a 2012 study in which participants’ ability to pay attention sharply increased when they wore a white coat they believed had belonged to a doctor. What the study suggests, she says, is that it is our own beliefs about our clothes – the stories we attach to them, for example – that can make a difference to our behaviour. “It’s the power of the belief of the wearer,” she says. In other words, one person’s immaculate printed dress is another’s decades-old raving hoodie. And if it works for you, wear it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209a9f4a391a5b83d2641dcee944ad8e81f0677e/435_132_3069_1840/master/3069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2531e6296964b19f25e70ead1817c390","title":"my favourite film aged 12 goldeneye james bond","story":"The first 12-rated Bond film – and power-thighed assassin Xenia Onatopp in particular – seemed impossibly glamorous if you were just old enough to be admitted to the cinemaFamke Janssen’s GoldenEye character is a transparently ludicrous fantasy of a sexy, so-called “strong female character” the definitive bad-ass Bond babe with thighs that can (and do) crush a man to death, and a line in double-entendres to make a drag queen blush. Let’s face it, she practically is a drag queen – that flamboyant makeup, even when dressed in full military garb the constant outfit changes the pantomime orgasm every time a powerful weapon shoots its load (and yes, that is the calibre of double entendre we’re dealing with here).She is the reason Goldeneye was so important to me in 1995. She joined the pantheon of clippings from magazines that adorned my bedroom wall, the shrine to everything I considered attractive, aspirational or both. Between 1995, when Goldeneye came out, and my leaving for university in 2001, the lineup evolved. Blur and PJ and Duncan came down, replaced by pictures from FHM and Maxim, replaced in turn by clippings from Kerrang! of Marilyn Manson, Dexter from the Offspring and Davey Havok from AFI. But Xenia remained a constant, her image bleached by the sun over time until the red lipstick became pink.In short, to my 12-year-old eyes, Onatopp was the definition of the perfect woman. GoldenEye was the first Bond film I saw at the cinema (the Tower Park leisure centre in Poole, a magical place where a sign used to boast that “a galaxy of entertainment awaits”), which may have had something to do with my infatuation. In one cinema trip, Bond went from something one might half-watch on television on a bank holiday to a transporting slice of silver-screen fantasy.While the intention of BBFC certificates may be to primly prescribe a minimum viewing age, they also often function as a guide to the ideal age to see the film in question. That’s very much true of GoldenEye, which was the first Bond film to make use of the 12 certificate. While, to fully grown Bond fans, this may have signalled a toning down of the franchise (the previous entry, The Living Daylights, was a 15), to us 12-year-olds it meant something sophisticated and grownup had been created specially for us – like when the drinks industry invented alcopops. And I was only just 12, only just allowed to see something so hard and cool and dangerous, so I was desperately excited while trying hard to pretend it wasn’t a huge deal, like all cool people.And boy, did GoldenEye deliver. From the opening action sequence with Bond ing off the massive Contra dam, to Sharpe from ITV (Sean Bean) getting killed in the line of duty (or was he?), to the first heady thrums of Tina Turner’s still unbeatable Bond number, I was hooked. Even the opening credits were insane: a Hugh Hefner fugue state in which ladies open their mouths and guns come out. Are the guns sexy? Are the ladies sexy? What is going on?! I wasn’t sure, but I was riveted.I rewatched GoldenEye a few weeks ago, chatting all the while with a group of friends over WhatsApp. It was the first full week of lockdown and we figured it’d be a fun watch. It was, although there was also a fair bit of tedious exposition and some fun but unnecessary padding with Robbie Coltrane and an American guy. In my mind’s GoldenEye, the film is nothing but suspenseful set-pieces and drama, and, of course, that big, man-crushing crush. But isn’t that always the way when you look back at being 12? Nobody remembers the tedious exposition and unnecessary padding when you look back it’s all suspenseful set-pieces and drama. And of course, the crushes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0da346faddf23ebba4536e1136bd7fceb990a69/207_151_3471_2082/master/3471..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c2f4dc300dd832a3bd4e7b7b71a9e6","title":"yotam ottolenghi recipes for lockdown","story":"From spicy beans on toast to new takes on European classics, our resident star cook picks 10 of his favourite archive dishes made with store-cupboard staples (and a few twists of your own)After the first few minutes of boiling, spaghetti are just stringy strands that you really wouldn’t want to eat.

They’re already hereAs the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund loomed closer this week, an uplifting tweet from Faustino Asprilla began doing the rounds. “Mike Ashley saw fans of Newcastle like bar codes, hopefully that will end soon this team is for lovers not for just merchandisers,” Asprilla wrote, focusing on the departure of the unloved current ownership.Even within the tin-eared nexus of social media there is an element of double-take about the response. To date Asprilla’s tweet has received 8,000 likes and retweets. Scroll down the replies and the attitude towards the prospective change of guard is unreservedly positive. Hand-clap emojis “Class” we deserve more get rid of greed in football (seriously!) – and not just from long-suffering fans, from paid observers too.At which point it is necessary to take a step back, slap yourself a few hundred times around the head to shake off the cognitive dissonance, and attempt to process how the scales of good and bad seem to work around here. Exit, the House of Karrimor. Enter, the austere and unforgiving House of Saud, a process that is somehow being hailed as a victory for “lovers” and the end (more laughter in the dark) of the cynical commodifying of Newcastle United.Perhaps it is time here for a tale of the tape. Mike Ashley: pig-headed retail magnate. Saudi Arabia: blood-stained inherited dictatorship. Mike Ashley: zero hours contracts in his sports shops. Saudi Arabia: beheaded 37 men in a single day. Mike Ashley: showed disrespect to Rafa Benítez. Saudi Arabia: murdered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi. Is this useful at all?Ashley wants to sell you a cheap nylon tracksuit. Saudi Arabia wants to sell you a soft-focus view of its oppressive regime, safe in the knowledge that a mega-spending spree will provide instant distraction, thereby treating the fanbase of a great British football club as useful idiots in the soft‑power game. “We’re getting our club back,” has been a refrain in the last few days. Really? Because it looks more like something more precious is being taken away.To date the most common responses have included: you never mentioned Club X or indeed Club Y, who are also owned by sportswashing regimes. Another popular theme is that journalists stick up for Mike Ashley because he’s “from London” (Ashley is from Buckinghamshire. Mohammed bin Salman, on the other hand, is much more of a Londoner: he does at least own a fair bit of it).This time, however, it does feel as though something has changed. Perhaps we are at a tipping point in this process. Because the whataboutery does actually have some substance. Newcastle may be the headline act, but they’re not even half the story.If we really are to make a stand on this, to suggest that a regime where homosexuality is punishable by flogging (awkward Rainbow Laces day ahead) isn’t a desirable guest at the top table of British sport, then that process is going to require a hasty rewind. The fact is, the Saudis aren’t coming. They’re already here, carried through the financial arms of the PIF like some irresistible super‑virus particle.It is a process to which the wider world of sport has already given in. We are all Saudis now, touched in some form by the success of the 2016 national transformation project, designed to diminish Saudi dependence on oil and create a pop-up global leisure economy.The WWE and world boxing are on board. Even dear old moral high hats Barcelona have a commercial link with Samba, a Saudi finance company.It’s no secret why this is happening. Throwing money into sport is a shortcut to cultural legitimacy, and certainly much easier than keeping Amnesty International happy. The question is what, if anything, those who still have the will to see sporting clubs as a special case, a protected industry, are willing to do about it.There are some changes that could help. A rule against sovereign wealth funds owning majority stakes in football clubs would be a start. Some kind of genuine fit and proper test is conceivable, one that involves a clearly defined notion of moral probity.And yet, you can already feel this collapsing. In a world where nobody is clean, where every hedge fund is connected to something grey, where even professional journalists struggle to see the difference between the harm done by leveraged buyouts and the moral vacuity of nation-state reputation washing, it is easy to fall into moral relativism, to lose any confidence in the ability to say this is not a desirable outcome.At the end of which Mohammed bin Salman is coming up the path in a black and white striped shirt.

For his club Vissel Kobe, Emperor’s Cup winners in January, the new J-League season started on 21 February and stopped again four days later due to the coronavirus crisis. It was due to restart on 15 March, then 29 March, and then 6 May. Now they hope it might be on 9 May. But who knows? And that is in a country seen as a model of pandemic management, one where, Iniesta says thankfully, “the situation appears to be under control”.It is just before dinner time, another evening on lockdown in his family flat, high above the city and about 6,500 miles from home in Spain. “There will,” he adds, “be a before and after.” Quite what that after looks like is a question that lingers, for football and for him.By the time the J League resumes, Iniesta could well be 36 (his birthday is on 11 May). This could be a watershed, time perhaps to look to retirement plans – coaching, rarely associated with him, comes up in conversation – but he resists. In fact, Iniesta thinks “all this time not playing will give me the energy to keep going even longer”.“Viruses, and this virus in particular, is a bit unpredictable. You ask yourself when can we get back to normal life? When can we leave our homes? When can we give each other a hug? We don’t know if the weather improving will mean the virus is reduced like any other virus or the flu, if a vaccine will be found? All those things are up in the air.”“When it comes to preparation, planning, motivation, stepping up your training because games are approaching … well, it’s impossible. You train full-on when there’s still a month left, or maybe more. The good thing,” Iniesta says, “is we’ve only played one game.”“In the short to medium-term the virus is bound to have a social and economic impact, on every level. Football is part of society it can’t escape that. You feel a responsibility to do the right thing as a person and as someone in the public eye. This will have an impact there will be measures that stay in place, changes, a before and after. We have to try to make the best of a terrible situation.”Could one benefit be that clubs, hit economically, are forced to draw on their youth systems? At Barcelona, perhaps it could force a return to an identity built on La Masia – the stone farmhouse in the shadow of the Camp Nou where Iniesta lived when he first departed Fuentealbilla, a small boy in tears? A return to the days when the Ballon d’Or podium was all Barcelona youth-teamers, Iniesta standing with Xavi and Lionel Messi, the only one of the three remaining.For many, these have been days of nostalgia. For Iniesta, too, completing the documentary that follows his biography, touching on those moments at Stamford Bridge and in South Africa the depression he suffered the death of his friend, the Eyol captain Dani Jarque and now his new life in Japan with his wife, Anna.There is one thing he still doesn’t reveal: what Frank Rijkaard said after leaving him out of the side for the 2006 European Cup final. “It would be wrong to repeat the words he said to me,” Iniesta says. Then there’s a joke, lost down the line. Nor, speaking of jokes, is the moment when he met Peter Crouch in the film – a running gag in the former England striker’s podcast – and why would it be? “I’m aware of it,” Iniesta says, “I just don’t remember if it was me who asked for the photo or if it was him.” Crouch would like to come to Japan, he is told. “Well, I’ll be here,” he says. “What’s he up to right now?”Otherwise, it’s all there. “Good moments, bad moments. I have always been clear that this has been my way of doing things, respecting others, trusting in myself, confronting things as they have presented themselves, taking them on without complaining when I wasn’t playing or when I saw something that wasn’t fair, always trying to make the most of the opportunity to play. And in the end, that’s the point: it’s about how you approach it.”It’s about the journey, one for for which he notes in one moment of the film: “I paid the toll.” That is most visible in the eyes of his parents, José Antonio and Mari. “My mum has almost never spoken publicly and it’s emotional hearing her,” Iniesta says. Yet, the moment when the passing of time is marked and melancholy most takes hold may even be when Messi talks about their generation, the finest in Barcelona’s history: in the tone, the eyes, the slipping away of his sentence, there’s a realisation that the end is near.

Barcelona can feel like it has lost its religion, La Masia less-fertile ground now more a battleground instead. Those days seem a long way off, even though Iniesta departed less than two years ago, Xavi three years before, and Carles Puyol and Víctor Valdés a year before that. Messi, Gerard Piqué, and Sergio Busquets remain but are all well into their second decade at the club.“That generation will never be repeated but what follows does not have to necessarily be worse in terms of how the club fares,” Iniesta says. “I had seen Puyi go, I had seen Víctor go, and then Xavi had gone … you concentrate on your own day-to-day, you still have a great team around you, top players.”Yet you can’t help wondering if a player like Iniesta would be given the chance any more. If something has been lost and the only way to recover those ideals, that identity, is to recover that generation, bring them back. Worse, you cannot help wondering if he had gone prematurely if it need not have been the end, his departure linked to the drift, a disconnect. In the film, that hint hangs heavy, a lingering sense that there is blame to be apportioned.“Erm … ‘blame’, no … it’s no one’s fault. In the end, things happen the way they have to happen. And they happened like that and I took the decision because I felt it was the one that I had to take.”“There have been all sorts of eras in the club’s history: young players used to get a chance in the first team when results were bad and they had to turn to the youth team. That happened in my era,” Iniesta says.“But then you have the period when you have 10, 11, 12 players from the youth team in the first-team squad. It depends on who the coach is, the situation of the club, but I always think that a player in the youth system who is good enough to play in the first team reaches the first team.And you? “Right now, I’m trying to extend my playing career as much as possible, I want to kick a ball for as long as I can because that’s what makes me happy. I’ve got a contract until next year, 2021, but I’m looking at things at the end of every season and I feel good, motivated. I want to keep playing and we’re delighted to be here.“When it does end, I have always said that I would love to go back to Barça. It all depends on how? In what role? What situation? Who is at the club? That’s some way off. But with everything I experienced there, all the feelings I have, I would love to go back.”The next cycle has already begun. In January, Barcelona offered the manager’s job to Xavi, Iniesta’s midfield partner, defenders of a footballing faith. Xavi turned it down, for now, but admits that he does want to return to coach the team. Víctor Font is preparing his candidacy to be president of the club in 2021, in opposition to the current board, and Xavi would be his manager. What if he called Iniesta to go with him?“I don’t know if I will coach or not. And Xavi is four years ahead of me: I don’t know where he will be when I stop playing. Let’s see,” Iniesta says. “As a formula, it’s very good.”As a formula, it was the best. For now, though, Andrés Iniesta just wants to play football. “It’s what we all want,” he says.• Andrés Iniesta – The Unexpected Hero is available on 23 April for free on Rakuten TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2780c66c570cbab5202bf204536cff6660d7602/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c05732befc2374547acbe1848ad10f5c","title":"football quiz england at euro 96","story":"England reached the semi-finals but do you remember the details?More quizzes: iconic photos, assists, English managers and rants"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e1433615a5fdb5eaa228722ab5038ef750aabc/0_0_2064_1239/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51de0d80fc5f980612347ab29a3aba7d","title":"how norman hunter became one of leeds uniteds biggest legends","story":"Nicknamed ‘Norman bites yer legs’, the Leeds defender won 28 England caps but had his biggest successes at Elland RoadNorman Hunter had to wait 41 years for his World Cup winners’ medal – as a non-playing member of England’s 1966 squad he was not deemed entitled to one until the rules were eventually revised – yet the Leeds United centre-half’s no-nonsense playing style is as fondly remembered today as any other from the era when televised football turned local heroes into household names.Partly that is to do with the wonderfully apposite nickname that followed him around after the 1972 FA Cup final against Arsenal, when a banner in the Leeds end declaring “Norman bites yer legs” was spotted and commented on by the studio pundit Brian Clough. There was more than a grain of truth in the assertion, though rather than being a menace on the pitch Hunter, whose death at the age of 76 was confirmed on Friday, was simply a brusquely physical defensive presence of a type common at the time.Every team seemed to have a strongman with a memorable and fondly bestowed pet name – Liverpool had Tommy “Anfield Iron” Smith and Chelsea had Ron “Chopper” Harris – and though some of the tackling might be considered hair-raising by modern standards, half a century ago it was just part of the game. In a way Hunter did bite yer legs – opponents had to be good or quick to get past him – but first and foremost he was an excellent defender, not merely the enforcer his sobriquet tends to suggest.Had Hunter not been able to play good football he would have been nowhere near a World Cup final at the age of 22. The reason he was unable to break into the side was because Alf Ramsey had decided Bobby Moore and Jack Charlton formed the best centre-back partnership and neither player became injured or did anything to warrant being replaced. Hunter just had to wait until 1970 but even then he found Everton’s experienced Brian Labone had moved ahead in the queue to play alongside Moore.Hunter did manage to make an appearance in the ill-fated quarter-final against West Germany in Leon. He came on for Martin Peters with nine minutes remaining only to see Uwe Seeler send the game into extra time then Gerd Müller supply the Germany winner.The defender’s luck was no better when he finally managed to break into the England team. He had replaced Moore in the side at long last for the 1973 game against Poland at Wembley that Ramsey’s team needed to win to qualify for the following year’s World Cup but ended up blaming himself for a mistake the visitors capitalised on to take the lead. Though England equalised, the win eluded them and for Ramsey as well as Hunter the World Cup trail came to an abrupt end.While Hunter might have won more than 28 caps had he played at a time when England were not quite as well-equipped with centre-backs, his club career at least was eventful and rewarding. He played 540 times for Leeds after being scouted as a Gateshead schoolboy and signing on at the age of 15, making his debut at 19 and forming a partnership with Charlton that would last a decade.Don Revie’s side were promoted from the Second Division in 1964 and were on course for a league and Cup double in the following season before losing to Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup final and being pipped to the title by Manchester United on goal average.Compensation for those disappointments arrived later in the decade as Leeds built on their success to become the strongest team in the country as the 60s turned into the 70s. Not necessarily the prettiest or best-liked, as Clough as Leeds manager is notoriously supposed to have pointed out, but there was no arguing with the eventual success under Revie, or that Elland Road had become the most daunting stadium for opposing teams.With Hunter a fixture in the side, Leeds won the title in 1969 and 1974, the FA Cup in 1972, and were losing finalists to Sunderland at Wembley a year later. The 1972-73 season also brought defeat in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final by Milan, a match in which Hunter was dismissed for retaliation at the end amid protests from the crowd over the impartiality of a referee who would receive a ban for match-fixing in subsequent games.However that controversy was nothing next to the heated disputes over disallowed goals and non-awarded penalties that disfigured the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern Munich.Franz Beckenbauer’s side won 2-0, though many still feel that Leeds, now being looked after by Jimmy Armfield after Revie had moved on to England, were cheated in Paris. The violent reaction from sections of the Leeds support resulted in the club being banned from European competition for two years, though it never needed to be applied as the great Elland Road years were effectively over.Hunter moved on to Bristol City in 1976. The £40,000 fee was an eye-catching one for a 33-year-old and Hunter played more than 100 games for the Robins before moving back north to end his career with Barnsley. He tried his hand at management when he finished playing at Oakwell, lasting four years after taking over from Allan Clarke, though a later spell at Rotherham was shorter and his last.Inevitably, perhaps, he spent later years as a meeter and greeter back at Elland Road, where he has a banqueting suite named in his honour. Every club should make the most of its legends, after all, and club legends do not come much bigger or bolder than Norman Hunter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7fef234a6d73949142cfe3a6187009d2890b74/0_30_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c2f458656bc78e6af10d3c7c47c2066","title":"namibias youngest mp enters the crucible as africa youth lead way emma theofelus","story":"Her ascent to a cabinet position at the age of 23 took her by surprise. Yet across southern Africa, young leaders like Emma Theofelus are on the riseOne of Africa’s youngest cabinet members to date is experiencing a baptism of fire.Emma Theofelus, 23, was appointed Namibia’s information, communication and technology deputy minister a week after coronavirus hit Namibian shores. “I have literally been learning on the job so far,” she says.Part of Theofelus’s role is to help lead communication to the public on preventative steps against the pandemic.The former youth activist and justice ministry legal officer was having a quiet Saturday at home when the surprise call came from State House.“I have been put in a position, regardless of what limitations I might have, to show up and do the best that I can do,” says Theofelus, who has had to learn very quickly how to navigate governance and political issues.So far Namibia has seen “tremendous results” in giving real-time information about coronavirus to the media and the public while thwarting fake news, she says.The appointment of younger leaders to high office is not entirely new in Africa. Thomas Sankara, for example, was 33 when he became president of Burkina Faso in 1983, and Abiy Ahmed was appointed Ethiopian prime minister last year at the age of 41.In neighbouring Botswana, trade economist and consultant Bogolo Kenewendo was only 29 when she was appointed minister of investment, trade and industry. Like Theofelus, she didn’t rise through party political ranks but rather was appointed for the skills she could bring to the portfolio. This is especially unusual in southern Africa, where the credentials of the older liberation war heroes, born of struggle, often weigh more heavily than educational qualifications.The same was true for Vera Daves da Sousa, 35, who became Angola’s finance minister last year. She is now tasked with reviving an oil-based economy suffering its worst recession since civil war ended in 2002.In the past decade regional powerhouse South Africa has welcomed a larger number of younger cabinet members, too. For example, last year Ronald Lamola, 35 and a lawyer by training, was appointed justice minister. He rose to prominence a decade ago as part of the youth league of the governing African National Congress (ANC), where he was a close ally of Julius Malema, one of the most prominent young African politicians in recent times. They went their separate ways after Malema was expelled and formed his own party.In the past month, Lamola has been part of a team consisting of mostly older ministers regulating South Africa’s tight coronavirus lockdown. In an unprecedented move by the president, another young colleague, communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, was this week ordered to take leave for breaking these rules after she was pictured on social media having lunch at a friend’s house. Ndabeni-Abrahams, also from the ANC Youth League, was 33 when she became deputy minister in 2011.It is in South Africa’s national legislature where the ages are truly dipping. The ANC’s Itumeleng Ntsube made history by becoming the youngest member of parliament in the country’s history after last year’s general elections. Ntsube, aged 20 at the time, was joined by at least four former student activists who made names for themselves a couple of years earlier in the #FeesMustFall protest movement.Across the border in Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe clung to power until the age of 93, former Olympian swimmer Kirsty Coventry, then 35, was appointed minister of youth, sport, arts and recreation in 2018 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. In the same year, Jessie Majome, from the opposition MDC Alliance, became the youngest parliamentarian aged 25.Mugabe was also known for appointing young ministers, such as the firebrand youth leader Saviour Kasukuwere, who became deputy minister of youth development and employment creation in 2005 at the age of 35.But having young leaders in government isn’t always good news. Instead of advancing youth interests, the appointment of young people as ministers in Zimbabwe “has been done over the years expediently and selectively”, says Harare-based Ibbo Mandaza, director of the Sapes Trust thinktank.“It’s mostly done half-heartedly, because the older generation doesn’t want to give up power,” he says. “It’s also done as a way of co-opting and buying off the opposition.”Mandaza says Coventry was appointed to woo white Zimbabweans. “There has not been a pattern of a systematic attempt for generational change in the region.”Some heads of state have made young appointments to compete favourably with the opposition. For example, MDC leader Nelson Chamisa is 42, while in South Africa Julius Malema turns 39 this year.The 2018 Gates Foundation report, which focused on youth population growth, said investment in the booming youth population could be good for African economies because if young people are healthy, educated and productive, they could “do the kind of innovative work that stimulates rapid growth”.Theofelus says she genuinely believes President Hage Geingob has good intentions. “The first time I met him I was 17, and from what I’ve observed he’s always been surrounded with young people,” she says. “This was perhaps him walking the talk that young people are the leaders of tomorrow and we have to prepare them today.”This does put a lot of pressure on her as a representative of young people, she says.Melanie Verwoerd, a Cape Town-based political columnist who in 1994, aged 27, became an ANC MP and the youngest woman in South Africa’s first democratic parliament, says that while she believes it is important to have young public representatives, and while younger people have enormous energy, on a personal level age would have made her a better politician.“As a young MP I had enormous energy, so I was working myself to the ground,” says Verwoerd. “But I was incredibly productive.”Now, she says, “there is a sense and balance that comes with age and experience. I think I would be wiser, I would certainly be a lot less hot-headed.”Being young in high office also brings frustrations. Aged 34 she became ambassador to Ireland, where her youth meant many colleagues in the diplomatic corps didn’t take her seriously. “They would look me up and down and the ambassadors would say: ‘You look hopelessly too young to be an ambassador.’ And I had a standard refrain to say: ‘Ja, they tried the old men, and that didn’t work out so well, and now they’re giving the younger women a try.’”Youth per se is not necessarily an important quality for leadership.“If it’s the right person for the job and the right responsibility, I think age makes no difference. It’s just important that, in particular for young people, there are mentors, there are people who guide them through the process,” says Verwoerd. “Maybe it becomes a little more important than for experienced, older people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times.

The service’s rivals, such as Amazon’s Prime Video, with an estimated 118 million users, and Disney’s new streaming service, also benefited from new users. Disney+ only launched in the UK and other western European markets in February, and has already doubled its global subscriber base to 50 million.Such has been the demand for streaming services that Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and the BBC’s iPlayer agreed at the start of the lockdown to reduce the speed of their streams across Europe to ensure broadband networks could cope with significantly higher usage.Netflix is among Wall Street’s so-called Faang stocks, the most popular and best-performing US technology companies. The acronym also includes Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google.Amazon and Netflix investors have shrugged off concerns about the effect of the pandemic on Netflix’s scripted TV and film production in the US, which have been paused.Meanwhile, ExxonMobil and other oil giants, including the UK firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have seen their share prices tumble as demand slumped to the lowest level in 25 years.The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned the biggest oil production cuts in history would not be enough to offset the huge fall in demand, to levels not seen since 1995, even if travel restrictions are eased in the second half of the year.Earlier this month ExxonMobil announced it would reduce its spending by a third this year, a reduction of $10bn, as it scaled back plans to cope with the fall in global oil prices. The cuts will be concentrated in the US’s Permian Basin, located in Texas and New Mexico."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a67ac9d93dc26b42f180f9de6af27ee828a8e69/0_0_4961_3307/master/4961.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84c9197d18787dde7d55db23d56d615f 660w","title":"unusual homes for sale in pictures","story":"From a tower taller than Nelson’s column to one that housed secret second world war equipment"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1cd7b2349e74d49029d0f72b5f365c96a47d4b/1732_781_3565_2139/master/3565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0243c73a8d80b309732f537dfec1b09a","title":"apply to stay in uk under eu settled status scheme","story":"Government close to target figure, but researchers still fear citizens may be missed outThe Home Office has received 3.4m applications from people seeking to stay in the UK after Brexit under the EU settled status scheme.It puts the government close to its overall goal for the scheme, with estimates of the number of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens eligible to remain in the country lying between 3.4 million and 3.8 million.However, monthly data, which was published on Thursday, shows there is still a backlog of 320,000 applications and researchers at Oxford University have warned that many citizens may “fall through the cracks”.EU citizens in children’s homes, care homes or those who are victims of domestic abuse, where others may not be aware or allow them to apply, have been cited previously as among those at risk.Detailed breakdown provided by the Home Office shows there were 125,000 applications to the scheme in March.This brought the overall number of applications received up to 31 March to 3,468,700, including approximately 180,000 non-EU nationals who are family members.The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said in a report, Not Settled Yet, published on Thursday, that there was no way of verifying whether the government was reaching its goal because there was no official means of doing so, as no registration system existed before for migrants.Madeleine Sumption, the director of the research unit, warned that the government could relax thinking it had captured data for all of those eligible to remain in the UK when many may not apply at all.“The government has invested a lot of effort in making the EU settlement scheme easy to use,” she said, “but with any scheme of this size it is inevitable that some people will fall through the cracks. It will be very hard to know to what extent this has happened, without a parallel investment in new data.“For a host of reasons, it’s possible that the number of EU citizens granted status through the scheme could greatly exceed the current official estimate of 3.4 million but that wouldn’t necessarily mean the task is finished.”The campaign group the3million said it had concerns that some of the more complex cases were now taking up to six months to resolve, creating anxiety for many families whose lives were put on hold.It also expressed concern over the lack of information about refusals.“We have gone from ‘nobody is being refused status on eligibility grounds’ to hundreds of refusals per month, without knowing why cases are being refused,” said Maike Bohn, one of the group’s co-founders.“The real question is how many people have not applied, and the government simply doesn’t know it. Every single EU resident to miss the deadline of 30 June 2021, for whatever reason, will automatically lose their legal status in the UK. It is crucial we know how many, who, and where they are – but we have no data that would allow us to establish this.”The data puts Polish citizens at the top, with 665,000 applicants, but it has been estimated previously there are about a million Poles in the country. Some returned home after Brexit.Romanians are the second highest number of applicants by nationality, at 564,300, followed by Italians at 351,600 and Portuguese at 273,000.The Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline and if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they would be given a further opportunity to apply.It also pointed out that the scheme would open beyond 30 June 2021 “not just for those with reasonable grounds for applying late, but also to accommodate those granted pre-settled status, who will be able in due course to apply for settled status, and close family members living overseas at the end of the transition period (and children born after that date) who later join a resident EEA or Swiss citizen here with status under the scheme”. • This headline and first paragraph of this article were amended on 16 April 2020 to clarify that 3.4m was the number of applications received this is not necessarily the same as the number of people who have applied for settled status."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c2705e0d3da0358f495ce0478a7a2a1c48a4fce/0_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=779c0c018db619dd1ee7cbd3d1df40c8","title":"uk coronavirus live lockdown last three weeks dominic raab latest updates","story":"Health secretary takes questions from Commons committee further 58 deaths in Scotland brings total to 837Labour’s Rosie Cooper says there will be cancer patients around the country surprised by what Hancock was saying. Patients are having their treatment delayed. She says there is a disconnect between what Hancock has been told, and what is actually happening on the ground.Hancock says there are cases when there are good clinical reasons for treatment being delayed. But he asks Cooper to give him details of other cases, so that he can investigate them.Q: Are the deaths of NHS staff being referred to the Health and Safety Executive for investigation?Hancock says these deaths are being investigated by NHS bodies. They are the employers, and are best placed to know what happened.Q: Should HSE be involved?Hancock says he thinks the NHS should do this.Q: But if someone died because of a shortage of PPE, doesn’t that investigation need to be independent?Hancock says there is an independent process in place - introduced by Hunt when he was health secretary, he says.A total of 837 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 58 from 779 on Thursday, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.Sturgeon said 7,409 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 307 from 7,102 the day before.There are 189 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of seven on Thursday, she added.There are 1,799 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19.Hunt turns to the impact of coronavirus on other aspects of treatment.Q: Is it the case that this is having no impact on cancer treatment?Hancock says that is the government’s policy.He says there are some treatments that would not be safe in the current circumstances, with a deadly virus prevalent. Some cancer treatments take your immunity down to zero. So it would not be safe to use those treatments now.He says this is not a capacity issue it is a policy issue.But he says there is “one area where I’m really concerned”.There has been a drop off in “first presentations”, he says. He says this is a “big worry”. There are “far, far fewer people coming forward”.He says the government has spent years encouraging people with cancer symptoms to see a doctor. But that has “come to a juddering halt”.Anyone with a lump should call the doctor. They will be seen, and seen safely.Q: One doctor has said the delays in cancer treatment could lead to more deaths than from coronavirus. Is that right?Hancock says he thinks that is “unlikely”.But he says there are concerns about the impact coronavirus might have on other people needing treatment.Border Force officers have been seen fitting face masks to people believed to be migrants at Dover on Friday.The Border Force cutter HMC Vigilant has been active in the Channel this morning, PA Media news agency understands, and pictures taken in Dover show the suspected migrants being processed by UK personnel wearing fluorescent jackets.The latest incidents come as the growing Covid-19 threat, a lack of food and the exodus of volunteers has left migrants in northern France in a perilous position, according to a humanitarian charity.Nearly 400 migrants are known to have risked their lives in small boats to try to cross the Channel since lockdown measures were put in place in the UK on 23 March.Q: Have you considered using the extra critical care capacity to intervene with patients earlier? There have been some reports of patients getting oxygen too late?Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, says when patients are first admitted to hospital, they often need oxygen therapy, but not ventilation.Q: Is national guidance being issued on what doctors must do if they need to ration care for clinicians?Hancock says the government has not had to issue this guidance, because the capacity of the NHS has not been reached. The “overwhelming of the NHS” has been avoided, he says.Hunt says he wants to ask now about treatments.Q: If we conclude a drug is safe, would we speed up the usual regulatory processes?Hancock says so far there have not been any clinical trials that have proved the value of any of the drugs thought to be helpful.But the UK is using some of them, because there is some evidence they are useful.He says this allows some scientific verification.Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, comes in this point. He says, without randomised control trials, you cannot know what will work.Q: So are you saying you won’t short circuit the need for these trials once you know it is safe?Van-Tam says you need to do trials. You need to know it is safe. You need to know what type of patients it might work best on. And you need to know at what stage of treatment it should be delivered.Q: So we are going to carry on following the normal processes?Van-Tam says Hunt is asking about safety. But some of these drugs might worsen outcomes. That is why trials are so important.Hunt says this amounts to a belt and braces approach.Hancock says that is not right. He says clinical trials are being accelerated faster than usual.Q: Do you accept the claim from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) that the distribution of PPE nationally has been “shambolic”?Hancock says he thinks the criticism in that letter was unfair. And he says since it was written the government has published a plan for adult social care.Hancock says PPE does have to be certified by the Health and Safety Executive. But he says they have been working rapidly to certify PPE coming in from abroad.Back to the health committee.Hancock says this figure is robust. It is based on testing. But he would expect it to rise, he says.Bus travel in London will effectively be free from this Monday, when passengers will all start boarding through the middle door. They will not be required to “tap in” to pay, with most buses now only having Oyster or contactless card readers at the front beside the driver.The change comes after other measures to protect drivers, including installing full protective screens around the cab, sealing off seats near the front, and giving enhanced sick pay to staff to ensure any whose family show symptoms are able to self-isolate for 14 days.Unions welcomed the move, after the deaths of 15 bus drivers and six other transport workers in London from coronavirus. Pete Kavanagh, of Unite London, said: We have lost members of our bus family in recent days and we refuse to lose any more.Claire Mann, TfL’s director of bus operations, said:Even with these significant safety enhancements I would like to remind Londoners to stay at home to ensure that critical workers and London’s bus drivers can get around the city safely.The move to middle door boarding comes only a matter of weeks after TfL changed all buses, including New Routemasters, to front door boarding only, ironically to prevent fare evasion before the Covid-19 crisis.TfL is still in discussions with the government about covering lost revenue across all modes of transport during the lockdown - especially fares from the Underground, which largely fund buses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933f9e370a87924c8ab4f5085291a1c54265469d/0_79_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d58967c95ee0b721ad6d6583eda679","title":"international space station crew return to earth","story":"American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space StationThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio’s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of Friday.Morgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.“It’s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we’re truly going back to a different planet,” Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.“We were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren’t.”The trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by medical experts wearing masks after landing. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.Following the medical check-up, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US.Isolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.The new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week, had been kept under stricter-than-usual quarantine for a month before beginning their journey to prevent any chance of coronavirus infection. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.Astronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS. Before blastoff, Cassidy said part of him was pleased to be leaving Earth at the most uncertain time in a generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

The second World Cup semi-final at Twickenham in 1999 seems like yesterday to me even though Émile Ntamack, France’s left-wing on that autumn day, now watches his son play for their country. No one in the stadium will ever forget it. At the end, and I kid you not, I turned round from my seat in the East stand press box and grown men were actually weeping.Context is all. This wasn’t just an astonishing spectacle. It came, like so many French performances in World Cups, completely out of the blue. The All Blacks were so far ahead of everyone it wasn’t true. Jonah Lomu was in his pomp and their backline, with Christian Cullen, Tana Umaga and Jeff Wilson operating outside Andrew Mehrtens, were cutting other teams to shreds.Earlier in the competition New Zealand cold-bloodedly scored 101 points against Italy in Huddersfield. They had been beaten in the final four years ago when Nelson Mandela was South Africa’s 16th man and they were going to make no mistakes this time.France were their usual flaky but often brilliant selves and nobody was giving them a hope. This view was shared by the ’s newly appointed rugby correspondent. “I’ll do Australia against South Africa, should be pretty good, and you can watch the All Blacks beat France,” the sage-like Robert Kitson told me during the week. (He may not have used those actual words but you have to allow me a little one-upmanship and smugness for this feature).And so it came to pass. Rob watched the thrilling spectacle of Matt Burke kicking eight penalties against the holders while I, bless him, went to Twickenham 24 hours later to witness what Paul Simon might have called “a day of miracles and wonders”. My only regret is that the following weekend Australia beat a flat France, perhaps shattered after their semi-final efforts , in the dullest final ever.All was going to the script as New Zealand ran up a 24-10 lead. A black tidal wave threatened to submerge France. Lomu powered through the tackles of Xavier Garbajosa, Philippe Bernat-Salles and Fabien Galthié as if they were so much dead wood in an autumn gale. The full-back Garbajosa later admitted that he had deliberately ed the wrong way to avoid the express train that was Lomu and who could blame him? Poor France, their Six Nations wooden spoon earlier that year was going to be followed by a humiliation witnessed by millions.And then the rugby world was turned upside down. France scored 33 points without reply. Their fly-half Christophe Lamaison, only in the side because Thomas Castaignède was injured, kicked two drop-goals and two penalties. France were within touching distance. Fear gripped the All Blacks. Surely they couldn’t muck this one up? We were on the edge of our seats.The scrum-half Galthie, now France’s head coach, kicked a teasing up-and-under down the left touchline. Christophe Dominici thundered after it and raced round Mehrtens to score. France were ahead. Pandemonium broke out. The French pack rumbled forwards.By this time Lamaison could do nothing wrong. His chip bounced into the arms of Richard Dourthe, who scored another. With five minutes to go, though, New Zealand still had shots to fire. Mehrtens flung a pass to Umaga but the wing could not hold it and Lamaison kicked the ball from the French 22. Olivier Magne hacked it on into the New Zealand half and Bernat-Salles won the race with Wilson to plunge over.There was no way back despite Wilson’s last-minute reply. Never before had the All Blacks conceded so many points in a World Cup game. I’ve been lucky enough to see two other remarkable World Cup games live, Fiji against Wales at Nantes in 2007 and Japan beating South Africa in Brighton in 2015 are up there, but nothing matches this.When I got my breath back I phoned the  sports desk. “I’ve just seen the greatest game in the history of the World Cup,” I said. “Yes, we know,” came the weary reply. (I was forgetting that everyone was watching on telly.) “That’s why we’ve cleared the front page.” Ah. Happy days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/491c9ec4dfb8d5a01ea51d4935697d08f41bd016/0_243_4437_2663/master/4437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d7690d1115ed34eb387acb1de99987a","title":"my favourite travel photo by readers","story":"From stunning beaches to New York’s finest, our tipsters reminisce about holidays past through both words and picturesMy daughter Iris is fearless, especially around water.

But the hummingbird moves faster than I can set my shutter speed. The first picture has her as a smudge across the lens. In the next shot I captured only a flower, perfectly in focus but sucked of nectar, and the bird had flown. I learned to listen for the blur of wings I learned to slow my breathing I learned to be still. Elizabeth GowingWe’d visited Etosha national park before, but had rushed from one waterhole to the next. This time, we decided to spend a whole day at Okaukuejo waterhole. While tourists loaded in to safari vehicles, we sat and watched. Herds of springbok and zebra gave way to jackals hunting and playing. They were joined by a rhino and giraffes. Shortly before midday, over 20 elephants suddenly appeared, and rushed into the water like excited teenagers. The safari vehicles hadn’t returned from their searches, so it was just us (well, and one other couple) and the elephants. Magical. Frances ValdesOn a budget trip to Japan with my sisters and brother-in-law, one night in Osaka we stumbled into this tiny bar. The place was charming but, without any menus, we were afraid of falling into the classic tourist trap of spending a fortune. Several times, the kind, aged bartender explained we were in a nomihodai. The problem was, we didn’t know what that meant. We cautiously ordered one drink each and – on his insistence – a glass of sake. He was so hospitable and tried to serve us food and more drinks but, still uneasy, we politely declined. It was only afterwards we learned that a nomihodai is an all-you-can-eatdrink bar. We could have stayed there for hours!Sarah CollingsI took this in Gambia after our taxi broke down in the middle of nowhere. We had to walk a mile to the nearest village to find a mechanic. The local children found our breakdown quite amusing. This had been a special day, travelling cross-country to see chimpanzees and hippos in the wild. So although we missed our ferry back, the day will stay with me for a long time.Richard GabrielThis is my daughter Lucia (aged 14) in the sea at Peniscola, near Valencia, in 2010. The photo sums up that holiday – hot, watery and very Spanish. Every day we would gather at our apartment poolside bar, where all the holidaying locals in their swimwear would drink cold wine, eat seafood tapas and smoke. There were very few British tourists but a number of French and Germans. In the town there was a wonderful cafeteria called Los Jubilados run by retired ladies who served vast plates of arroz negro and chipirones at ridiculously low prices. It’s a beautiful place to visit, particularly in the summer heat.Simon WilliamsTo celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary in August 2016, we invited a crowd of family and friends to join us in West Sweden – many of whom had been with us when we married on the beach on the island of Orust. We live in the UK but visit my husband’s native land as often as we can. The day we visited the island of Tjörn to jump from the ing tower at Stockevik was perfect, sunny and warm. Heaven!

My family really put this assessment to the test when within 10 hours of arriving my dad’s long-term medical condition had flared up. This precipitated a mad rush to get him on the last night ferry to Islay, through the tail end of Hurricane Dorian. From Islay hospital he was airlifted to Glasgow (and apparently fed chips en route by the paramedics). He returned in good health to the tranquillity of Jura, where members of the population of 188 showed the full extent of their hospitality and generosity. He thereafter received innumerable free ferry trips and enquiries after his health (it seems gossip spread remarkably fast!).CoraWalking along the Southbank, I came across this shot.

Scheduled to launch in mid-spring, it was set to be the keystone of the channel’s daytime schedules – a bright, buzzy magazine show fronted by rising star Steph McGovern, newly freed from the clutches of the BBC. Shot live from a prime slab of Leeds waterside real estate before a lively studio audience, The Steph Show was gearing up to breathe life into the channel’s fusty daytime output. And then the coronavirus happened.“I’m just at Asda,” McGovern tells me over Zoom. “I had to queue for 45 minutes to get in.” She finished recording her ninth episode three hours ago, and has come straight from the studio to buy baby milk for her five-month-old daughter. And when she’s finished, she will head straight back to the studio to feed her. Because things have changed, and now she hosts The Steph Show from her house.In what sounds like an incredibly frantic few days last month, Channel 4 scrapped its original plans for The Steph Show, brought the launch date forward by three weeks and decided to film it in McGovern’s ground floor. An engineer visited her house for a feasibility assessment. Cameras were hooked up on fixed rigs around her house. Satellite trucks positioned themselves on her lawn. She filmed a trailer, holding up placards Bob Dylan-style from behind a window. They rehearsed on Sunday. The next day, the first show aired.“It was incredibly fast, but everyone wanted to get it on air. It was one of those things where we’re all in it together,” McGovern says. “I mean, the lawn is going to be wrecked,” she adds ruefully.Incredibly, the show works. McGovern wanders around her house (more of which later), chatting to celebrity guests over Skype, checking in on families who are attempting to adjust to the new situation and finding experts to discuss the practicalities of life under lockdown. Last week, she attempted a cookery segment, with the Cold Feet star Fay Ripley bravely attempting to instruct her remotely on how to make mac and cheese. McGovern botched it, but kept returning to the dish to grab a mouthful over the course of the next few minutes, the same way you or I might. For anyone stuck by themselves at the moment, it must feel like dropping in on an old friend.“That’s exactly how we wanted it to feel”, says Channel 4’s head of daytime, Jo Street, whose decision it was to bring the series forward. “Steph does feel like an everywoman. She’s the girl you want to have a beer with, or go for a coffee with, or be mates with. For a massive part of our audience, that is the job that she’s doing every lunchtime.”Indeed, it’s hard to see how this would work had anyone else been in the driving seat. If a big name had presented a daytime show from their imposingly large house, viewers would have been instantly alienated. But McGovern’s house, although beautifully designed – her integrated kitchen banquette has already become something of a national talking point – is basically a normal-sized family house. The living room, dining room and kitchen are all essentially the same thing, and you could probably walk from one end to the other in less than 10 seconds. Her partner and baby have to hide in a bedroom during the broadcast. McGovern says that her daughter “tends to sleep through the show. That’s how much she cares about it.”The main thing, she’s finding, is locating the balance between family home and television studio. “Keeping it tidy is the big thing,” McGovern says. “A lot of viewers have said to me: ‘How come your house is so clean?’ I’m like: ‘Because it’s on telly.’ I’ve got a bit of a routine of an evening. We have our dinner and then, once everyone goes to bed, I just whizz around and try and sort it out. We have a deal. My partner does the cooking and I do all the tidying.”And yet, despite all this, there’s more to McGovern than her everywoman persona would suggest. Before being poached by Channel 4, she had been BBC Breakfast’s lead business presenter for a decade. Before that she was a producer, in charge of the business news for the BBC’s one, six and 10 o’clock bulletins. At the age of 19, during an apprenticeship with Black \u0026amp Decker, she devised a new production technique that saved the company £150,000 a year. When Have I Got News For You decided to continue filming remotely without an audience, she was the first choice to host. In short, she knows her stuff. And this extends to her plans for the direction of The Steph Show.“I’ve learned that I want real people to be the focus of it, and that’s what I want to keep driving through,” she says. “Yes, it’s lovely to have some celebrities on, but, for me, what’s better are people like the blood biker volunteers we had on yesterday. Or the 14-year-old girl who lost her hands when she was a baby and can now play piano because she learned it in lockdown. I know it sounds cheesy, but that’s what I think is going to make this show good.”“Public service broadcasting is not just news and current affairs,” adds Street. “It’s about connecting to an audience when they need you. Steph was really passionate about that.”It all sounds lovely, but these are uncertain times. Without wanting to get any darker than necessary, I have to ask McGovern about contingencies. Her show is called The Steph Show. It’s filmed from her house. Hopefully it won’t, but what would happen if she finds herself becoming ill?“We’ll have to see if Stephanie Cole is available,” she shrugs. “Do you know what? Nobody has an answer to that. I have not got a clue what we would do. If I wasn’t too ill, then I would like to think I would try to carry on in some capacity. If I got really ill, someone else could do it. I’m not precious about it. Johnny Vegas seems to be appearing a lot. I might ask him if he could.”So successful is The Steph Show in this new form, in fact, that I wonder whether this is perhaps how it should always be. Broadcasting from her home gives the show such a ramshackle and intimate quality that it already feels as if the show’s voice has been found. Has anyone considered abandoning the studio and carrying on like this after the lockdown lifts?“Yes. Sure,” scolds Jo Street, sarcastically. “Because this is such an easy way to make a television programme.” McGovern also admits that continuing like this for ever is her “biggest fear”, but then adds that the current set-up is bound to inform the show when it is broadcast as intended. “Or maybe I could just recreate my entire house inside the studio,” she ponders. “I might just go full-on Alan Partridge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f568db1e238efdc180395546d88ddce2d38fa10a/0_60_2007_1204/master/2007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac25c96230b6c5d7e4c777f26a4c4a33","title":"alan davies jonathan creek caroline quentin maddy magellan sleuth","story":"Alan Davies’s self-assured amateur sleuth and Caroline Quentin’s feminist writer take us back to a happy golden age of bad haircuts, landlines and denimDuring two weeks of social isolation, I discovered the best antidote to coronavirus anxiety I’ve found so far: Jonathan Creek.For those unfamiliar with the 1990s murder mystery show, Jonathan Creek follows the adventures of the eponymous magician’s consultant (Alan Davies), who – for the first few series at least – gets dragged into solving crime by his writer friend, Maddy Magellan (Caroline Quentin). Each episode starts with a baffling mystery that defies any rational explanation. The pair investigate, and Creek, with a  talent for rational thought worthy of Edgar Allan Poe’s amateur sleuth Auguste Dupin, is unfailingly able to make sense of the crime. The trick is revealed.Today, with uncertainty sprawling off into the horizon, there is something deeply comforting about a universe in which everything can be explained after an hour. A detective who uses unwavering rationality to crack the most bewildering of mysteries is a reassuring presence. No shit, Sherlock. But there are other things about Creek that make it particularly enjoyable right now.Compared with the mounting crises of the past decade, Creek’s late 90s world seems like a shimmering paradise. Post-Berlin Wall but pre-911. A time when, to borrow from the poet Frank O’Hara, the day came fat with an apple in its mouth. There’s something deeply enjoyable about seeing the denim jackets, brutal haircuts, the slang, the landline etiquette, Blur playing in the background.Then there is Maddy. The character, who was written for Caroline Quentin, is one of the best things about the show, drawing from 90s “ladette” culture (of which Quentin was more than familiar with from Men Behaving Badly) but without lazy cliches. Her boundless confidence, rogue investigative methods, and dismissal of “macho protectiveness”, make her the driving force of the drama and a counterweight to Creek’s lateral thinking abilities. In The Curious Tale of Mr Spearfish, Jonathan debunks a theory Maddie comes up with in a way that could come dangerously close to mansplaining. But he is undermined by her having duped him into doing her laundry, and is in the middle of trying to iron her bra even as he talks.Of course, there are some elements that have dated poorly. Subplots around minor female characters can be a little horrifying there are some cringe-worthy moments of orientalism. But Maddy’s vibe is still liberating to behold, more than 20 years later: she is commanding, resourceful, sexy without being oversexualised, attractive for her authenticity, and bold – all on her own terms. It is interesting to see how this expression of late 90s feminism (which often gets a bad rap) matches with today’s ideas. But also, while everyone around you is constantly anxious, it’s relaxing to spend time with such a fantastically self-assured character.Stuck inside for days on end, I found myself getting lost in the places Jonathan and his companions visit. The old manors. The ghostly castles. The moody coastal walk. The weather plays a key role in creating atmosphere, switching between gothic-style thunderstorms and sunlit old English towns. And this isn’t the only source of storybook cosiness there is also a healthy emphasis on food, chats in cosy pubs, late-night coffee. The show’s homeliness is a reminder of happier, more sociable times.But probably the most comforting thing of all is that it’s a show about friendship. Under lockdown, we can be both very near and very far from those we love. In Jonathan Creek, the exasperating overfamiliarity between the partners is where the relatable human drama comes from. On the surface, there’s a Sherlock-Watson style set-up. But unlike the showboating Holmes, Creek is an introverted soul who would rather not be there. Particularly in the first season, the only reason he even gets to the crime scenes is because Maddy keeps tricking him into thinking they are going on some kind of date.The creator, David Renwick, leans heavily on familiar detective tropes – all the better to subvert them. In doing so, he creates a driving concept for the action, but with plenty of scope for characters sending each other up, stepping on each other’s toes, getting on each other’s nerves. All too familiar for those of us working from home.No one knows how long this crisis will last. If you are not in a frontline job and feel as if you are living in your own locked-room mystery and are thus looking for some relief, Creek can help restore some joie de vivre. It will take you through an absorbing 90s reverie of castles, companionship, and conviction – things we all need more of at the moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ae4fb41865b5e0d1cf9f6c0bc9041685aa606f/0_169_5164_3098/master/5164.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=30757a2f529bc3e84a4a183e04a8f088","title":"how has access to outside space impacted you during the lockdown","story":"We would like to know how your experience of lockdown in the UK has been shaped by your access to outdoor spaceWith lockdowns in place around the world, we know that the experience of staying indoors is very different depending on your access to outdoor space.We’d like to hear how your access to space has impacted you over the last three weeks.

Raab said ministers had received “very clear advice” from Sage, the expert scientific committee advising the government, that lifting restrictions now would risk a damaging second wave of infections, which would “substantially increase the number of deaths”.“It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.”His announcement came as ministers faced new calls to explain how they intend to control the virus so that the lockdown can eventually be relaxed – with one adviser, Neil Ferguson, breaking ranks on Thursday to call for a “single-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing”.He said the government needed to accelerate action as it had with Brexit and argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks.“Without that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway. If we relax measures too much, then we will see a resurgence in transmission,” he told the BBC’s Today programme.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, reacted to the criticism testily, saying Ferguson “advises government. He is not in the government.”When pressed for a timescale on lifting restrictions, Raab pointed to Boris Johnson’s remark of a month ago, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to “turn the tide” of the virus. “That, broadly, is the outline,” Raab said. The UK is now in its fourth week of lockdown.Raab set out five conditions that would need to be met before any loosening of the rules. These included a sustained fall in the daily death rate, and confidence that the supply of PPE and testing can meet future demand.In a rebuke to rightwing commentators arguing for the lockdown to be lifted to alleviate the economic costs of having businesses shuttered and workers furloughed, Raab added that “early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period”.Rather than lifting the restrictions, Raab talked of “adjusting” them, adding: “It could mean relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in some other areas”. A Downing Street source called the approach “keyhole surgery”.He stressed that while the infection rate had fallen in the community, “we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes”.Hancock promised more testing and protective equipment for care home staff on Wednesday, with many reporting inadequate supplies and haphazard advice from the government.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the extension of the measures. “I fully support the government’s decision to extend the lockdown,” he said. ‪“The priority now must be to ensure we see a ramp-up in testing, that staff get the PPE they desperately need, and that more is done to protect our care homes from the virus. We also need clarity about what plans are being put in place to lift the lockdown when the time is right.”Raab was deputising for the prime minister, who is convalescing at Chequers after being hospitalised with the virus. Downing Street said Boris Johnson was not involved in the decision to extend the restrictions, but that Raab had updated him by phone.One Tory MP said it was “rightwingers in cabinet and the wider party” who were pushing for an early exit from the lockdown, but that No 10 was highly cautious.A senior Westminster source with knowledge of the government’s thinking said they believed a move towards contact tracing conducted by an army of trained people was about to become “the next big U-turn”. Previous reversals of government policy include the acknowledgement of the need for mass testing, the abandonment of the herd immunity strategy, and the realisation that an antibody test was harder to develop than first thought.Another change of heart could be over the wearing of masks by members of the public. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty said this was “a very live issue that we are re-examining”. He said there was medical evidence of a “small” effect on the transmission of the virus.Advisers had previously suggested there was little benefit to wearing masks, but Whitty said: “The point about scientific advice is, it evolves.”The chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, also hinted at ongoing measures, saying the challenge was to get R – the transmission rate of the virus – below 1 and keep it there. “There may be a number of measures that need to be continued to allow that,” he said. “There will be some changes that need to take place, around things like home-working.”Hancock will come under pressure to commit to a coordinated testing and contact tracing regime when he appears before a blockbuster select committee hearing on Friday, led by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt and attended by several other committee chairs as guests.Hunt has long been pushing for a mass testing and tracing strategy, which was dismissed by the government’s experts in mid-March when they moved from a policy of trying to contain the virus to trying to delay its peak.At that point, on March 26, Dr Jenny Harries said testing and contact tracing was “not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward”, despite the World Health Organization’s exhortation to “test, test, test”.The government has since conceded the point on mass testing and begun to develop an app that can help trace contacts. However, there are concerns that online tracing will not be effective at reaching older people, that it is voluntary, and that privacy concerns may hamper its usefulness.

But a dozen renters and their attorneys told the  that some landlords are proceeding to expel them from their homes despite the new regulations, indicating there are significant gaps in the protections.Those tenants include a pregnant woman, a cancer patient, an elderly woman, a mother of six, several newly unemployed low-wage workers and others vulnerable to Covid-19.Unable to pay rent in April, they have faced eviction notices on their doors, police officers attempting to remove them, pressure from property owners to immediately vacate and written demands from landlords spreading falsehoods about the emergency laws. Some tenants said they were moving out as a result, becoming homeless amid a pandemic.“We want to pay, but we don’t have the money,” said Virginia Gómez, a 51-year-old Los Angeles woman threatened with eviction from her home of three years. The property owner of her building last week repeatedly called police to try to remove her and her six children after she couldn’t immediately pay full rent due. “I told the police, ‘You guys are wearing masks and gloves, but you want to throw us out to the streets when the virus is out there?’ How are we supposed to ‘stay at home’ when they kick us out?”As California prepared to implement a shelter-in-place order to stop the spread of the virus, government leaders acknowledged that rent would be an urgent and vast problem. In March, the governor passed a two-month statewide delay on imposing evictions for people who can’t pay rent due to Covid-19. The order prevents the enforcement of evictions until the end of May, but requires tenants to repay the full amount later. Some cities, like Oakland and LA, have adopted stronger protections.But the accounts and records from tenants across the state indicate those regulations ultimately fail to provide relief for those who are most in need, and are not being properly enforced. In some cases, the confusing patchwork of local ordinances has allowed landlords to continue targeting tenants in a state that had a severe housing crisis before coronavirus.Roughly 2.7m people have filed unemployment claims in California since residents were ordered to stay home. Across the US, an estimated one-third of renters didn’t pay April rent.Though the courts aren’t currently processing evictions, some landlords are still starting the process, or unlawfully attempting to remove tenants. It’s difficult to know how many tenants across the state are threatened with eviction, but advocates in LA, the Bay Area, and parts of the Central Valley say they’ve anecdotally heard of a handful of cases in which owners have launched evictions. They’re hearing more frequently about tenants facing misinformation and misleading threats from landlords.Krystal McMorris, 29, is pregnant and currently fighting to keep her apartment in Alameda, an island across the bay from San Francisco: “I don’t have any options. I have to stay here. I have to fight. If not, I will be homeless and pregnant. I already fear this stress is going to cause me to lose my baby.”McMorris worked for six years for FPI Management, a real estate corporation, as an on-site property manager, a job which included her apartment. After the pandemic was declared last month, FPI terminated her position and told her she had 30 days to move out, despite the eviction moratorium and regional shelter in place orders. When McMorris asked the company to allow her to stay until the Covid-19 emergency had passed, telling her boss she was pregnant, the company responded that she “does not have rights” and that it could have forced her out in three days, but instead gave her until 17 April.“If she fails to vacate by that deadline, we will take immediate legal action to regain possession of the unit as soon as legally possible,” Brandi Hutchinson, FPI senior director, wrote to McMorris’ attorney, adding that she would now owe $3,030 a month.Despite her fears of contracting Covid-19, McMorris went to multiple open houses around the Bay Area last weekend in hopes of finding a new apartment, exposing herself to strangers, but found nothing affordable or livable. “There’s no housing, no employment. Everyday I’m afraid. It’s been dreadful, scary, stressful, frustrating.”McMorris, who lost her health insurance and has been unable to go to the doctor, said she wants to leave her apartment, but has nowhere to go. “People are dying left and right. I was just asking that they at least give me more time.”FPI’s chief operating officer, Dave Divine, did not respond to specific questions about how the company plans to “regain possession” of her apartment, but said in an email that “FPI is compassionate to Ms McMorris’ situation” and has not forced her to pay rent . “FPI’s actions have been and shall remain consistent with all applicable laws.”Gómez, the mother of six, has lived with her family for three years in the Courtyard Motel in Downey, an LA suburb. Although it’s a motel, she and other tenants live there full-time and, according to attorneys, are protected under anti-eviction laws, including the new Covid-19 regulations. But after the father of her children lost most of his income at a restaurant due to Covid-19, the family ran out of money to pay rent. She said she pleaded with the motel manager, saying she would pay everything she had as soon as possible.Managers responded by calling the Downey police department to remove her, and officers showed up to her door, telling her she had to leave. Because she happened to be on the phone at the time with Monica Arellano, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of LA, the lawyer was able to talk to the officers and explain the law. Police eventually left, but the motel called the department again multiple times that day, requiring her to repeatedly explain her rights to new officers.She still paid the minimal cash they could, $370, after getting a check, leaving her with little money for other basic necessities. She said the managers continue to threaten her. “Anytime I leave my room, I fear they are going to call the cops on my kids, and I’ll come back and they’ll be kicked out,” said Gómez, who has lupus, a long-term autoimmune disease that puts her at higher risk of Covid-19 complications. “I keep telling them whatever money we have we’ll give it to them.”The Downey police department did not respond to inquiries. Reached by phone, Rushabh Bhakta, a representative with the motel, said his staff made a payment arrangement with Gómez after calling police.Sonia Aguilar, 43, who is recovering from breast cancer, has faced threats from her LA landlord, who has said he wants her family out by the end of April. Earlier in the year, Aguilar, her husband and three children had planned to move, but once the pandemic hit, it became impossible and dangerous for her: “I have underlying health issues and I only go out for food and medicine. I’m not in any condition to rent a U-Haul. It’s scary.”But the landlord, Ezequiel Navar, won’t stop calling them, she said: “The stress is making me more ill.”Some tenants are fighting hard to assert their rights in the face of eviction threats.“I knew it wasn’t an obligation to pay, and that it was better to keep that money for food and emergencies,” said Michelle Johnson, a 28-year-old LA resident recently furloughed from her job at a coffee company. After she told her property manager she couldn’t pay, the manager said she was required to submit three pay stubs, proof of unemployment and two bank statements, and then sign a payment plan. None of this is required by law. The manager then taped an eviction notice on her door, a “three-day notice” to pay or leave, the first step of an eviction lawsuit.“It was not only an intimidation tactic for me, but it was also for other tenants to see,” said Johnson, whose apartment is near the front door of the building. “Unfortunately for y’all, you picked the wrong informed tenant. I know this is illegal.”It was still emotional for Johnson, who experienced homelessness as a child. But she responded with an email reminding the manager of her rights, and then filed a complaint with the city. “The city isn’t doing enough to make sure landlords are doing their job.” (LA’s housing department did not respond to a request for comment.)Shirin Bina, 36, said she “completely fell apart” and cried for days after receiving a similar three-day eviction notice on her door in Oakland. “It just seemed like she had absolutely no regard for me as a human being,” Bina said of her landlord, Debra Reese. “She broke the ‘shelter in place’ to put that on my door.”Bina told Reese she couldn’t pay after losing a job as a bookkeeper and other work. She reminded her landlord of Oakland’s ordinance. Reese responded: “You failed to provide documentation and you failed to pay your rent therefore this method will be utilized.”Bina said she has struggled at times to understand her rights, adding, “If there’s such severe repercussions for a tenant not paying rent, there should be severe repercussions for a landlord abusing the law at this point.”Reese did not respond to inquiries.Chris Tyler’s landlord in LA asked that he sign an agreement saying he would immediately report his “stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, payments related to paid family leave, disability insurance payments and Covid-19 related loans” so the owner can \u0027“accelerate amounts due”. Tyler, who works with the LA Tenants Union and lost his job at a bar, said he knew not to agree to the contract, but worries about others: “When you’re in a precarious situation, and you don’t know your rights, you obviously feel compelled to sign.”The LA Tenants Union has urged people to withhold rent and has called for lawmakers to freeze rent and mortgage payments during the crisis. If the state passed a rent forgiveness law, it would ensure tenants avoid insurmountable debts. In the meantime, advocates said, cities should proactively enforce the protections in place and hold landlords accountable when they violate renters’ rights.The tenants union is also assisting 70-year-old Pamela Fairbanks. She paid her rent, but her landlord, Steve Kaali, showed up at her door this week with an eviction notice, alleging she had too many cats. Fairbanks, who has lived in her apartment for 25 years, said she has long owned three cats. She said she has also been in quarantine for weeks while recovering from bacterial pneumonia: “I panicked. I was shaking. I could barely breathe through the tears.” Reached by phone, Kaali said the cats are an ongoing issue because they go in and out of the apartment, and his eviction notice was meant to be a “scare tactic” to get her to install a window screen: “I’m not taking her to court knowing I’m not going to win.”He added that he hasn’t tried to remove her from her rent-controlled apartment and bring in a higher-paying tenant: “I could’ve been a slumlord scumbag who kicks everyone out. I did not.”Jonathan Cañez and Tamiaya Moore, roommates who live in Bakersfield in the Central Valley, both lost their longtime jobs at a local hotel due to Covid-19. When they told their landlord they couldn’t pay rent, the manager told them they would owe the full amount and should move out if they can’t afford it.“We decided it’s better to just cut our losses,” said Cañez, 25, who is moving in with his brother. They didn’t know how they would ever be able to pay back the rent: “I’ve worked so hard to have this place to call my own, a safe space. To have that shift away from me has been very hard and humiliating.”Moore, 26, is going to sleep on an air mattress at a friend’s house for now. She’s been applying to jobs at grocery stores, but is also afraid of working there due to her asthma and the reality that essential workers are dying on the job. “I’m emotional because I was just getting my life together. Now it’s going to be rough for awhile.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230689.1587060926!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert students unlikely to progress to third level courses before november","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe question of whether students who successfully appeal grades will be able to start college in the academic year is a subject of debate in higher education circles. Photograph: Getty ImagesLeaving Cert students who progress to third-level education are likely to begin their courses as late as November this year, according to education sources.The decision to postpone the Leaving Cert until late July or early August means students’ results and college offers will be pushed out much later than usual.Several third-level institutions say they are planning to admit first-year students in either late October or November under best-case scenarios.The exact dates will depend on the timing of the exams, the duration of the marking process, and how quickly results and offers can be provided to students, according to well-placed sources.“We’re looking at November at the very best,” said one higher education source, who declined to be named. “This is assuming everything goes smoothly and that timeframes for everything can be compressed.”Another said they were looking at classes beginning in late October or early November, allowing time for students to accept offers, find accommodation and take part in an orientation programme.In addition, colleges are planning to make up lost time during the academic year by cutting short Christmas holidays and reading weeks for first-year students. This should allow them to complete their summer exams as normal.Much of the timings being discussed, however, will hinge on the timeframe for the exams and the marking process.One source said if the Leaving Cert takes place at the end of July, the earliest the exams would be completed would be mid-August.However, some institutions are preparing for the possibility of exams beginning in August and running until the very end of the month. Education circlesThe question of whether students who successfully appeal grades will be able to start college is a subject of debate in higher education circles.This issue was the subject of a high-profile High Court case in 2018, when Wexford student Rebecca Carter argued that she should have been able to start her veterinary medicine course after a totting-up error meant she wrongly missed out on an offer.Judge Richard Humphreys, who presided over Ms Carter’s case, ruled in Ms Carter’s favour and called the system “highly unfair” and “manifestly unfit for purpose”. He insisted that the situation could not be repeated.Some institutions believe they will need to accommodate these students who gain places after successfully appealing their grades.However, others believe the late start-time means these students will have to be offered places in the following academic year due to the unprecedented late start date.There have also been calls for higher education institutions to provide more places for access students from disadvantaged backgrounds this year due to the challenges facing many Leaving Cert candidates.The suggestion by UCC emeritus professor of education Áine Hyland has since picked up support from the Teachers’ Union of Ireland and political parties.Many third-level institutions, meanwhile, are preparing “virtual” open days for students who are considering their course choices.Institutions such as Waterford Institute of Technology, Dundalk Institute of Technology, Maynooth University and NUI Galway are among those organising such events. Open daysDuring each virtual open day prospective students or parents of CAO applicants will have the chance to chat live with lecturers and take interactive campus tours.Marketing and outreach officer at WIT John Power said people would be able to join the conversation online and see the questions other prospective students have.“A big part of each virtual open day is the chance to talk with lecturers who deliver our undergraduate programmes and the support staff from right across the institute,” he said.“Online each day you can chat with staff from our admissions, schools liaison, outreach, fees and grants, accommodation and student life and learning departments.” "},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: CollinsSome 5,000 Irish citizens have returned to Ireland over the last month as the global coronavirus pandemic took hold. Over the Easter weekend alone, citizens were repatriated from Vietnam, Cambodia, New Zealand and South Africa. A further 1,000 citizens have conveyed an interest in returning home, the Government has revealed. Meanwhile, more than 45,000 employers are now registered with the temporary wage subsidy scheme set up to keep workers in employment during the pandemic and associated restrictions on movement and commerce. To date €267 million has been drawn down from the scheme and most of it will be in the bank accounts of employers next Monday, the assistant general secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach Liz Canavan has told a daily briefing on Friday. The Government is increasing the amount it will pay under the coronavirus wage subsidy scheme in a bid to keep more part-time workers on the payroll.The subsidy, introduced as an emergency measure last month, will be increased from 70 per cent to 85 per cent for employees who earn less than €24,400 per year.Under the changes, the scheme will also be extended to higher-paid workers – those earning over €76,000 – in a bid to reduce the number of people being laid off. The move comes after employers said that some of their part-time and low-paid staff were not working because they could earn more from the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.Glas payments to farmers will be brought forward by a month and €26 million will start issuing to 42,300 farmers early next week.

This is a St Patrick’s Day like no other. A day that none of us will ever forget.”It may seem like a lifetime ago but it has been one month since Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told us in a St Patrick’s Day address to “come together as a nation by staying apart from each other”.The biggest social experiment ever attempted in this country was, as everyone foresaw, rolled over after a two-week period. After some delay, the Taoiseach’s gently proffered directions were given teeth through the enactment of draconian laws requiring citizens to have a “reasonable excuse” for being outside.In his March 17th address to the television cameras, Varadkar warned: “We cannot stop this virus but working together we can slow it in its tracks and push it back.”A month on, this central objective has been largely achieved. There have been bumps on the way, and performance in different areas has varied, but much of the health service has prepared well, while the blow to the economy and to our inidual livelihoods has been cushioned for now.At the time the Taoiseach spoke, Ireland had 292 Covid-19 cases and two deaths now we’ve had some 13,000 people diagnosed with the illness and more than 450 have died. Despite this upward trajectory, the die was already cast at the time of Varadkar’s address to the nation. The virus was circulating and infecting people rapidly, and the challenge was always going to be to limit its growth first.Mass social distancingThis has been achieved in large measure a daily growth rate of more than 33 per cent has been cut to about 6 per cent. Over the space of a month, the number of people contracting the disease from an infected person has dropped from an average of 20 to about three, as mass social distancing has taken effect.Beyond the numbers, however, we have endured those “difficult days” envisaged by the Taoiseach as thousands have fallen ill and hundreds have died.The expected frontline of the battle with coronavirus has shifted too. Despite difficulties with personal protective equipment, hospitals have coped well with the expected surge of patients by clearing out other business more effectively than expected and by ramping up capacity. The numbers of infected people in intensive care units (ICU) are stable and even falling slightly this week.Sadly, nursing homes and other residential centres have fared less well. The warning signs were there from an early stage, including a lack of specific guidelines, a lack of engagement with the sector and a lack of transparency.Frail exposedToday, the virus is present in hundreds of care homes, which account for more than half of all deaths. An inquiry into how so many mostly elderly and frail residents, as well as poorly protected staff, were left exposed is inevitable at some point in the future.May 5th is the new date for when the restrictions may end, but only a wild optimist believes a blanket departure from the measures is likely then.Ireland is, at least, near the top of the graph, probably. Having endured the Taoiseach’s “calm before the storm” and coped with the surge, we can soon look forward to cases and deaths beginning to fall.The problem is that there is no clear way out of this. While everything in our lives has changed, in terms of the challenge we still face, nothing has changed.Other countries may be easing their restrictions at present, but these moves are tentative. The science tells us the virus can and will return if social distancing ends. And if distancing stays, our lives stay altered immeasurably, at least until a vaccine is developed.In another demonstration of the challenge posed by this disease, a study published on Thursday in Nature found people were most infectious in the days before they showed symptoms. The only way to cope with it for now will be to build the testing and contact-tracing system we have so far failed to properly develop.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Three men with hurleys assaulted victim in Blarney and posted video onlineMore than 45,000 employers registered with the wage schemeINMO seeks immediate investigation into procurement of PPELetter sent to Varadkar and Martin seeks economic projectionsPlants seized from Co Kerry property would have estimated street value of over \u0026euro200,000, garda\u0026iacute sayDeaths at Maryborough Centre in Portlaoise stark reminder of human cost of pandemicNational emergency team will review measures taken to tackle nursing home outbreaks at Friday meetingMore than 400 troops affected by UN decision to prevent spread of Covid-19NPHET to review Covid-19 measures in nursing homes and other institutionsHospital in Dublin\u0026rsquos Phoenix Park said deaths had been recorded since April 2ndConcerns over continuing independence and implementation of HSE contingency planCoronavirus: Confidential deal to take over private hospitals could cost State \u0026euro115m per monthVaradkar says the two deaths remind \u0026lsquous how healthcare workers put themselves at risk\u0026rsquoColleges plan to make up lost time in academic year by cutting short Christmas holidays and reading weeks for first-year studentsThere was one thing Hollywood got right about the mission: the necessity of expertsIreland\u0026rsquos political factions face a number of logistical challenges due to the pandemicFF-FG programme for government most significant, says St Vincent de PaulStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230957.1587072407!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"liverpool port detains p o ship on dublin liverpool route","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVolumes of freight have declined in recent weeks in line with coronavirus restrictions in Ireland,  Britain and Europe. Photograph: Getty ImagesA key supply line between the Republic and Britain has been disrupted by the impounding of the P\u0026ampO vessel Norbay by port authorities in Liverpool on Thursday. It is understood the dispute centres around the payment of €689,000 (£600,000) in fees to Peel Ports, owners of Mersey Docks and Harbour Company Limited, the formal name for Liverpool Port. The Norbay is one of three P\u0026ampO operated vessels on the Irish Sea between Dublin and Liverpool. The other two are the Norbank and the Clipper Pennant. The Norbank was loaded and ready to sail from Dublin on Thursday for a passage to Liverpool, but was later stood down and its cargo taken off. Volumes of freight have declined in recent weeks in line with coronavirus restrictions in Ireland, Britain and Europe, from where goods are sourced for Ireland via the British “landbridge”. In a statement P\u0026ampO said it had been “in discussions since this crisis began” with the owners of all of the ports it used “to ensure that we can manage payments while everyone deals with this unprecedented situation”. The ferry company siad it had “asked for flexibility” in terms of time to pay, but “the Liverpool Port refused to respond even though we were committing to full payment”. P\u0026ampO said “the irresponsible and unnecessary actions of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company Limited at a time of national crisis have closed an essential Dublin-Liverpool supply route, which means vital goods will not be able to flow between the UK, Ireland and Europe”.P\u0026ampO Ferries is owned by DP World, a global organisation which had earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of €3.04billion in 2019. In its response Peel Ports said Liverpool played a vital supply role in many key logistics chains, including medical, healthcare and food. It said “customers who refuse to pay their bills put these and other supply chains at risk. Any decision to detain a vessel is always taken as a last resort, and only when there is a significant debt to repay.” Freight forwarding Commenting on the significance of the impounding and the standing down of other P\u0026ampO ships trading with Liverpool, freight forwarding sources said the absence of P\u0026ampO should not cause panic. Sources said there were other companies – Seatruck, Irish Ferries and Stena – still operating on the mid-Irish Sea route to Liverpool and Holyhead. However, hauliers were fearful that the absence of P\u0026ampO even for a short time would affect their capacity to travel through Liverpool. Most of the Seatruck business on the route is for trailers, as opposed to drive-on and drive-off. Many drive-on and driver-off hauliers prefer to take the Liverpool route as they start early in the morning in Liverpool with “a fresh driver and a fresh tachograph” . The Holyhead route, said one haulier, was a shorter crossing, but the Holyhead port was “much further from the bulk of English destinations”.

It did not have a name two months ago.’Two weeks on from their alarming surge of Covid-19 related sanctimony and self-importance, a much subdued cohort of confirmed Government cases returned to the Dáil chamber on Thursday afternoon with their coughs considerably softened.The chilling outbreak saw Government Ministers and backbenchers losing the run of themselves entirely during a special session to discuss the coronavirus crisis, refusing to engage and throwing hissy fits at the Opposition for daring to drag their exalted personages into parliament at time of national emergency so they might be asked some important and legitimate questions.The only reminder of that dark day was Josepha Madigan’s defiant bottle of hand sanitiser plonked on the ledge in front of her and a brief reference from People Before Pandemic’s Richard Boyd-Barrett who valiantly refrained from crowing.“I welcome the fact that the Government has accepted the need to answer questions notwithstanding some, I thought, fairly disingenuous condemnations of those of us who thought it was important that this Dáil would sit and that Ministers would be subject to questioning the last time we were here.”This time, the Taoiseach led an impressive about turn from his side. Clearly the hugely negative reaction to the display of slightly sinister silliness – from genuinely motivated opposition politicians, media and general public – prompted a very different approach to the second special sitting to discuss the Covid-19 crisis.Messengers of the PeopleThere wasn’t a whiff of the superior and antagonistic tone which so astonished Opposition TDs the last time. From the beginning of Leo Varadkar’s conciliatory and inclusive opener, it was clear there would be no Government voice telling fellow Messengers of the People that they ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing the job they were elected to do.“I welcome the opportunity to hear from all sides of the House today,” said Leo. “Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions. If we can answer them we will. If we cannot we will say so but do please understand that in an evolving situation it isn’t always possible to answer all questions in real time. You simply just don’t have all the information and there is so much going on.” This was greeted with a very restrained level of eye rolling from the few deputies across the floor dispersed around the benches at socially acceptable distances.“And do, please , share your ideas as to how we can respond better to this emergency. No party has a monopoly on wisdom and we will need good ideas and good input from all parts of the House.”He also needs good input, wisdom and ideas from at least one part of the House if a new government is to be assembled from two of the three biggest parties (Sinn Féin having been told to self-isolate by the other pair) and a new component drawn from a assortment of highly suspicious smaller parties.But this complicated project wasn’t mentioned much during a debate focused solely on the state of our pandemic republic and how best the authorities can deal with it now and into the future.They need to find a willing victim now. Or perhaps an unselfish, public-spirited partner willing to put themselves out there for the sake of providing a stable government at a very perilous juncture for the country and its people.The main issue raised during the debate was the grim scenario in many care homes around the country, where the rate of deaths is spiralling and the staff and equipment situation is in a bad way.Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty was strong on the issue, standing in for his leader Mary Lou McDonald who has been laid low by the virus. There were good wishes for her speedy return to Dáil hostilities from all sides. There were also good wishes, for a happier reason, extended to Alan Kelly, the new Labour Party leader on his first outing since his elevation.The Taoiseach made copious notes as the questions came thick and fast. He covered one side of a folded up sheet of paper with a closely written, spider-like scrawl (once a doctor, always a doctor) and filled another, and another.Strict time limits He found it hard to keep up with the questions, asked without trace of hostility or political game playing by opposition members. With strict time limits on the length of contributions, the Taoiseach sighed it was quicker to ask a question than answer one “but I want to answer as many as I can”.When the opening statements concluded, the Ceann Comhairle called for questions. More? The Taoiseach waved his crowded pages in the air. “But . . . but . . . I’ve jotted down one, two, three, four . . . ” Plenty to be getting on with before the next batch.There were replies aplenty from the Taoiseach and then his Minister for Health, Simon Harris, on the problems in nursing homes and the reported crisis in some quarters over the lack of equipment.Mattie McGrath clouded the issue briefly with a slip of the tongue which he quickly corrected when calling for more “PE” equipment for nursing homes.Eamon Ryan of the Greens (seen as the man most likely to provide the third leg to the governmental stool even though the Green Party sounds a very long way from any class of a decision) made a wide-ranging contribution, ending with a call for better pay and conditions for care workers and front-line workers in all areas.He too spoke about worries over testing, as did Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrats who spoke about big pharma companies withholding a chemical agent needed for the testing equipment.The Taoiseach had a long, detailed answer concerning two companies she specifically mentioned. “I am learning a lot about the matter, as many people are, and one thing I have learned is that different machines use different reagents,” he began, launching into a dissertation of the different type of machines on the market and how they use different forms of the chemical.Things are changing from day to day. One crisis is overtaken by another and another, he said.“At various points over the past month, there have been shortages of swabs. At different points there have been shortages of testing kits, reagents and laboratory capacity and it’s almost like whack-a-mole” trying to keep up.“So it’s never ever as simple as sometimes represented in commentary.”But still, the word from care workers about equipment and conditions – as related many times on Thursday in the Dáil, did not tally with what the Taoiseach was saying back to the TDs.“I ask people to bear in mind that this is a virus that did not exist three or four months ago. It did not have a name two months ago.”There was praise and understanding for the Taoiseach and the Health Minister alongside the hard questions.They weren’t all satisfactorily answered, but Varadkar and Harris went a good way towards providing transparency and showed a willingness to continue doing it.A very necessary sitting. It’s a pity they had to fight for it to happen.But a good day’s work for all concerned in the Dáil."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231429.1587118270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"social democrats ask ff and fg to provide costings for coalition framework","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRoisin Shortall and Catherine Murphy, co-leaders of the Social Democrats, at Leinster House.

Photograph:  Yoan ValatPool via Reuters“We are all embarking on the unthinkable,” says Emmanuel Macron, leaning forward at his desk in the Elysée Palace in Paris after an aide has cleaned the surface and the arms of his chair with a disinfectant wipe.Until now, Macron has always had a big plan for the future.After winning power in a surprise election victory in 2017, the hyperactive French president announced a blizzard of ambitious proposals for reforming the EU that perplexed his more cautious European partners. When he chaired the G7 group of big economies last year, he tried to reconcile the US and Iran and make peace between Russia and Ukraine. His government has legislated furiously to modernise France.The coronavirus pandemic, however, has left even Macron groping for solutions to a global health crisis that has killed almost 140,000 people, and wondering how to save the French and world economies from a depression comparable to the crash of 1929.“We all face the profound need to invent something new, because that is all we can do,” he says.He still has plans, of course. He wants the EU to launch an emergency investment fund of hundreds of billions of euro through which the reluctant northern members would have to support Italy and Spain, where many thousands have died from Covid-19. And he wants richer nations to help Africa with an immediate moratorium on bilateral and multilateral debt payments.But perhaps for the first time, an uncharacteristically hesitant Macron seems unsure whether or when his proposals will bear fruit. “I don’t know if we are at the beginning or the middle of this crisis – no one knows,” he says. “There is lots of uncertainty and that should make us very humble.”Golden roomIt is a sign of “social distancing” and travel disruption in extraordinary pandemic times that the normally busy Elysée now has only a skeleton staff on site and that the Financial Times’s editor attends the interview via video link. The usually tactile Macron – of whom it was once said that “he could seduce a chair” – is forced to greet his guests from afar in the ornate salon doré, the golden room looking out over the palace lawns towards the Champs-Elysées.This room was first used as the French president’s office by General Charles de Gaulle. In two speeches to the nation a month ago, Macron deliberately adopted the tone of his presidential role model, declaring all-out war on the virus, imposing some of the strictest controls in Europe on people’s freedom of movement to slow the spread of the disease and declaring that his government would save jobs and companies “whatever the cost”. Behind his desk is a framed example of a $500 Anglo-French first world war bond from 1915.Yet in recent weeks the bellicose rhetoric has given way to a more reflective view of how to handle the pandemic, accompanied by admissions of logistical failures that have left French doctors, nurses and essential workers desperately short of protective masks and of tests to measure the spread of the virus.Unlike other world leaders, from Donald Trump in the US to Xi Jinping in China, who are trying to return their countries to where they were before the pandemic, the 42-year-old Macron says he sees the crisis as an existential event for humanity that will change the nature of globalisation and the structure of international capitalism.As a liberal European leader in a world of strident nationalists, Macron says he hopes the trauma of the pandemic will bring countries together in multilateral action to help the weakest through the crisis. And he wants to use a cataclysm that has prompted governments to prioritise human lives over economic growth as an opening to tackle environmental disasters and social inequalities that he says were already threatening the stability of the world order.But he does not hide his concern that the opposite could happen, and that border closures, economic disruption and loss of confidence in democracy will strengthen the hand of authoritarians and populists who have tried to exploit the crisis, from Hungary to Brazil.Globalisation“I think it’s a profound anthropological shock,” he says. “We have stopped half the planet to save lives, there are no precedents for that in our history.”“But it will change the nature of globalisation, with which we have lived for the past 40 years . . . We had the impression there were no more borders. It was all about faster and faster circulation and accumulation,” he says. “There were real successes. It got rid of totalitarians, there was the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago and with ups and downs it brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But particularly in recent years it increased inequalities in developed countries. And it was clear that this kind of globalisation was reaching the end of its cycle, it was undermining democracy.”Macron bristled when asked if erratic efforts to curb the Covid-19 pandemic had not exposed the weaknesses of western democracies and highlighted the advantages of authoritarian governments such as China.There is no comparison, he says, between countries where information flows freely and citizens can criticise their governments and those where the truth was suppressed. “Given these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let’s not be so naive as to say it’s been much better at handling this,” he says. “We don’t know. There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.”The French president insists that abandoning freedoms to tackle the disease would pose a threat to western democracies. “Some countries are making that choice in Europe,” he says in an apparent allusion to Hungary and Viktor Orban’s decision to rule by decree. “We can’t accept that. You can’t abandon your fundamental DNA on the grounds that there is a health crisis.”EU solidarityMacron is especially concerned about the EU and the euro. Banging the desk repeatedly with his hands to emphasise his points, he says both the union and the single currency will be threatened if the richer members, such as Germany and the Netherlands, do not show more solidarity with the pandemic-stricken nations of southern Europe.That solidarity should come in the form of financial aid funded by mutualised debt – anathema to Dutch and German policymakers, who reject the idea of their taxpayers repaying loans to Greeks or Italians.Macron warns that failure to support the EU members hit hardest by the pandemic will help populists to victory in Italy, Spain and perhaps France and elsewhere.“‘When immigrants arrive in your country, they tell you to keep them. When you have an epidemic, they tell you to deal with it. Oh, they’re really nice. They’re in favour of Europe when it means exporting to you the goods they produce. They’re for Europe when it means having your labour come over and produce the car parts we no longer make at home. But they’re not for Europe when it means sharing the burden.’”For Macron, the richer EU members have a special responsibility in the way they deal with this crisis. “We are at a moment of truth, which is to decide whether the European Union is a political project or just a market project. I think it’s a political project . . . We need financial transfers and solidarity, if only so that Europe holds on,” he says.In any case, Macron argues, the current economic crisis triggered by Covid-19 is so grave that many EU and euro zone members are already in effect flouting injunctions in European treaties against state aid for companies.The ability of governments to open the fiscal and monetary taps to stave off mass bankruptcies and save jobs will be pertinent for Macron’s own uncertain political future in France.With the national economy forecast to shrink by 8 per cent this year and millions of temporarily laid-off workers still being paid thanks only to a €24 billion official “partial unemployment” scheme, the government is expecting a 2020 budget deficit of 9 per cent of gross domestic product, the highest since the second World War.Domestic criticismAlthough often feted abroad for his energetic liberal internationalism, Macron has recently been treated by domestic opponents from the far-left to the far-right – including the anti-establishment gilets jaunes demonstrators – as a president of the rich, a former Rothschild investment banker who wants to impose free-market capitalism on his reluctant citizens.In reality, Macron had already begun to slow his reform drive before the pandemic in the face of stiff opposition from a resurgent left and from the vestiges of the gilets jaunes movement. After a busy two years liberalising the labour market, reducing the tax burden on workers and entrepreneurs and trying to simplify the country’s expensive pensions systems, he backtracked last year on cutting the size of the civil service and then last month suspended reforms entirely for the duration of the coronavirus crisis.He has tried to adopt environmental causes and soften his image to woo the left and the Greens ahead of a 2022 election that he hopes will be another second-round election run-off against Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme right Rassemblement National party.Covid-19 might offer an opportunity to make the case that he is trying to humanise capitalism. That includes, in his view, putting an end to a “hyper-financialised” world, greater efforts to save the planet from the ravages of global warming and strengthening French and European “economic sovereignty” by investing at home in industrial sectors such as electric vehicle batteries, and now medical equipment and drugs, in which the EU has become overdependent on China.There is a realisation, Macron says, that if people could do the unthinkable to their economies to slow a pandemic, they could do the same to arrest catastrophic climate change. People have come to understand “that no one hesitates to make very profound, brutal choices when it’s a matter of saving lives. It’s the same for climate risk,” he says.“Great pandemics of respiratory distress syndromes like those we are living through now used to seem very far away, because they always stopped in Asia. Well, climate risk seems very far away because it affects Africa and the Pacific. But when it reaches you, it’s wake-up time.”Macron likened the fear of suffocating that comes with Covid-19 to the effects of air pollution. “When we get out of this crisis people will no longer accept breathing dirty air,” he says. “People will say . . . ‘I do not agree with the choices of societies where I’ll breathe such air, where my baby will have bronchitis because of it. And remember you stopped everything for this Covid thing but now you want to make me breathe bad air!’”Like some of his predecessors – and unlike some of his counterparts in other western democracies – Macron is overtly intellectual, always brimming with ideas and projects that sometimes grate with his more sober European counterparts.Among the books piled haphazardly – or perhaps artfully – behind his desk are works by the late Socialist president François Mitterrand and Pope Francis, the letters exchanged by Flaubert and Turgenev, and a few copies of Macron’s autobiography, Revolution: Reconciling France, prepared for the 2017 election campaign.Yet when asked what he has learnt about leadership, he candidly admits that it is too early to tell where this global crisis will lead. Macron says he has deep convictions about his country, about Europe and the world, and about liberty and democracy, but in the end the qualities that are needed in the face of the implacable march of events are humility and determination.“I never imagined anything because I’ve always put myself in the hands of fate,” he says. “You have to be available for your destiny . . . so that’s where I find myself, ready to fight and promote what I believe in while remaining available to try and comprehend what seemed unthinkable.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: 40,000 people could die in the UK, public health expert warnsWatch: \u0026#34Drunk\u0026#34 Briton apprehended by Chinese police with pole for refusing to wear face maskThese are the NHS workers who have died from coronavirusWatch: Can you get coronavirus twice?Best TV shows to watch on Britbox, from The Good Life to BroadchurchPolice criticised for allowing people to flout lockdown rules to clap for carers on Westminster BridgeHow one town\u0026#39s collective trauma from 1918 Spanish flu saved it from another90-year-old climbs stairs equivalent to Highland mountain to raise money for NHSBoris Johnson recovering from coronavirus at Chequers – latest newsJet-setting elite stoke coronavirus class tensions in Latin AmericaRalph Lauren donates to the Royal Marsden Hospital: how the global luxury market is responding to the coronavirusHow does a coronavirus antibody home test kit work, and how do I get one?UK lockdown extended: have the guidelines changed, and when is it next reviewed?When will the UK lockdown end?

This rotation of the orbit is called a Schwarzschild precession.General relativity provides a precise prediction of how much this orbit changes and, according to the scientists, the measurements from their current research exactly match the theory.Mr Perrin said the study had been trying to address two different questions: the confirmation of Einstein’s theory and the existence of supermassive black holes, which he said scientists are “quite close” to achieving.Reinhard Genzel, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Germany and the architect of the programme, said: One hundred years later we have now detected the same effect in the motion of a star orbiting the compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the centre of the Milky Way.This observational breakthrough strengthens the evidence that Sagittarius A* must be a supermassive black hole of four million times the mass of the Sun.This is of great interest for understanding the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit

bid to stop paedophiles grooming children.The site, which allows teenagers to share short video clips set to music, said the feature would become age-restricted at the end of the month.The move was welcomed by the NSPCC, but the children’s charity also warned that social media companies needed to implement effective age-checks on users to protect children. It comes as police and children’s charities are warning parents that children are at an increased risk of grooming during the lockdown, as they spend more time on their phones.Paedophiles often use open social networks to make contact with children before trying to move conversations onto encrypted messaging sites, where they are harder to monitor.In December, NSPCC research showed that nearly half of online child abuse reports were now coming from Facebook and its sister apps Instagram and WhatsApp.TikTok is the latest social media app that has been rocketing in popularity in recent years and now has nearly one billion users worldwide.The app is particularly popular with younger teenagers who use it to share clips of themselves lip-syncing to pop songs.TikTok\u0027s head of trust and safety for Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Cormac Keenan said the move was aimed at ensuring families could trust the service.He confirmed that the new restrictions would mean only those aged 16 and over would be able to send or receive direct messages on TikTok.Direct Messaging is an amazing tool that enables people to make new friends and connections no matter where they are in the world, but despite its potential for good, we understand the potential for misuse, he said.TikTok has previously introduced a Family Pairing Mode which enabled parents and s to manage the experience of their children on the platform.The video platform said that anyone who will be impacted by the change will receive a notification in the app starting from Friday.Following the announcement, Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC praised the proactive step taken by the social media firm.This is a bold move by TikTok as we know that groomers use direct messaging to cast the net widely and contact large numbers of children, he said.Offenders are taking advantage of the current climate to target children spending more time online, but this shows proactive steps can be taken to make sites safer and frustrate groomers from being able to exploit unsafe design choices.It\u0027s time tech firms did more to identify which of their users are children and make sure they are given the safest accounts by default.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking

suggests. A study by King\u0027s College London, which tracked more than two million people using an app, suggests that cases have dropped dramatically since the country went into lockdown.The modelling predicts that the number of people suffering symptoms of the virus across Britain has dropped from two million to less than 583,000 over 14 days. The tracker also suggests there is little difference between urban areas and the countryside when it comes to the prevalence of symptoms. National data shows that, in recent days, the number of people admitted to hospital suffering from coronavirus has begun to plateau and may even be falling. The number of deaths has shown a similar pattern, but there are fears that some statistics may be misleading because of a time lag before some cases which occurred over the long Easter weekend are recorded.It comes as the latest UK figures show that there have been 13,729 deaths – a rise of 861 in a day – with 103,093 cases of coronavirus.The new research measures symptoms among a large sample of the population. This means it is likely to detect earlier changes in disease patterns, with hospitalisation among the most severe cases normally falling around two weeks after signs such as coughs and fevers first emerge. Previous research from the same study recently suggested that losing the senses of taste and smell may be the most reliable symptom of coronavirus. Scientists found that almost 60 per cent of people with the virus had lost those senses, compared with just 32 per cent who reported suffering a fever.Currently, people in the UK are instructed to self-isolate only if they have a persistent cough, a high temperature or both.Lead researcher Professor Tim Spector from King’s College London, said: It\u0027s very reassuring to see that the number of predicted symptomatic Covid cases is continuing to fall day on day across the UK but, with deaths still high, this is definitely not the time for complacency. We believe our population\u0027s symptoms are changing around two weeks before most people are admitted to hospital. Prof Spector said the data suggested there is still a large number of infectious people in the UK with mild symptoms, meaning it would be premature to lift the lockdown.It came as NHS England statistics showed that April 8 had seen the highest coronavirus death toll in England\u0027s hospitals to date, suggesting the rate of deaths could soon fall. However, officials have warned that data from recent days, including the Easter weekend, may not be up to date.Since the beginning of April, NHS England has been constantly revising its daily death count from across hospital trusts.Its data feeds into the Department for Health and Social Care releases which make headlines each day. But the daily DHSC tally often includes deaths which have occurred several days earlier. For example, the tally of hospital deaths announced on April 16 included deaths from as far back as April 1.Of the 740 deaths in English hospitals announced on Thursday, 79 per cent (587) occurred between Monday and Wednesday.The latest figures show 782 deaths in England on April 8, dropping to 674 on April 9 and 651 on April 16. However, the latter figure is likely to rise the most, given the time lag before some deaths are reported. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk faces eight ten waves coronavirus population achieves herd","story":"Hopes that Britain can achieve widespread Covid-19 immunity by the end of the lockdown have been dealt a devastating blow after research suggested only a small proportion may have acquired resistance to the disease.Drawing on the research, Professor Anthony Costello, a former British director of the World Health Organisation, warned that the UK faces eight to ten waves of coronavirus before the population achieves herd immunity.In such a scenario, both the death toll and economic consequences would be catastrophic.In the middle of March, before the lockdown was introduced, Sir Patrick Vallance, the country\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said about 40m people in the UK could need to catch the coronavirus to build up “herd immunity” and prevent the disease coming back in the future. Sir Patrick was defending Boris Johnson’s decision at the time not to follow other European countries by closing schools and banning mass gatherings. But on Friday Prof Costello, chair of global health at University College London, will heavily criticise the Government’s strategy in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in evidence he will give to the health and social care select committee.Professor Costello said the failure to conduct widespread testing and to rely solely on the lockdown will leave Britain facing wave after wave of coronavirus until a vaccine is found.Prof Costello also said a Dutch study - if it proved accurate - raised serious concern for the UK because it suggested just three per cent of the Netherlands had acquired immunity by the end of the first week of April - when the pandemic was at its peak in that country.The study, conducted by Dutch blood bank authorities, analysed tests for the Covid-19 antibody - an indicator of immunity - on 4,200 blood donors.Just three per cent had acquired immunity, the scientists concluded. Prof Costello said if the findings were verified that would have alarming consequences for the UK’s ability to fight coronavirus.He said: “We won’t get herd immunity if what the latest models show are correct. In the UK we would have to get through another eight to ten waves to get to herd immunity. This study in the Netherlands shows antibody levels are very low in the community and so the idea it is rapidly spreading and giving protection at the same time isn’t there.”He pointed to another study by Professor Karl Friston, a neuroscientist also at UCL, who in a paper submitted to one of the Government’s scientific panels suggesting that on average just 6.4 per cent of Europe will have acquired immunity by the end of the first lockdown.Prof Friston predicts 49,000 Britons will die from coronavirus - more than twice most mainstream estimates - but with immunity for 19 per cent of the surviving population.The Government has been condemned for its failure to implement widespread testing and tracing.Its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of the month is struggling to be met while critics have accused ministers of being too slow to implement the testing regime.Prof Costello described the Government as a “one club golfer”, for using only one strategy - lockdown - to combat Covid-19.“We should have introduced the lockdown two or three weeks earlier but we didn’t,” he said, “It should be combined with testing, tracing and digital apps that have been used so successfully in South Korea.”South Korea, which was hit by the virus much earlier than the UK, has recorded just 229 deaths, compared to the UK death toll of 13,729.Prof Costello added: “It is a total mess and we have been wrong every stage of the way. We have to change our policy and at the moment I don’t hear anything to suggest we are. They keep talking about flattening the curve which implies they are seeking herd immunity but what we should have done is crushed the epidemic and then  keep it down.”He said the academics on the Government’s main advisory panel - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)  - “have got most of it wrong”.He joined growing criticism that Sage’s meetings are held in private and that its membership is not made public.The Government had floated the idea of herd immunity before introducing lockdown after being warned as many as 500,000 people could die if coronavirus was allowed to rampage through the UK unchecked.A separate Oxford University at the end of March suggested as much as half the population could have already acquired immunity, based on an assumption that the virus had begun transmission in the UK more than a month before the first recorded death and that very few people need hospitalisation.The research was downplayed as an outlier by rival universities, also modelling for the virus’s progression. The Dutch study tested blood and plasma samples of blood donors in the week beginning April 1.Preliminary results show that the presence of antibodies varied across age groups with 3.6 percent of young blood donors between 18 and 20 years old having Covid-19 antibodies.The proportion decreased with age with no antibodies found among donors in their 70s although that represented only ten iniduals.The Dutch scientists concluded that iniduals who have recovered from the coronavirus have some degree of immunity. Another Dutch study has suggested that people with milder symptoms appear to build up less immunity than people who became very ill from Covid-19. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/25/11/empty-shelves-uk.jpg","title":"barclaycard consumer spending supermarkets specialist retailers uk economy recession household","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Consumer spending fell sharply in the month leading up to the lockdown\u0026nbspand these\u0026nbspfigures don’t bode well for the economy in the months to come, says James MooreBarclaycard’s monthly consumer spending data – the latest release runs from the tail end of February\u0026nbspto March 27 – has the feeling of a gathering storm about it.The month or so under consideration covers the run-up to the tight lockdown the country is currently under. Even then the impact on spending patterns was immense. There has never been a month like this one. That being the case, goodness knows what April is going to look like.Overall spending through bank’s credit and debit cards, which account for just under half of card-based consumer spending in the UK, was down by 6 per cent with some notably deep troughs such as travel, including public transport (40.5 per cent decline), and restaurants and bars (35.5 per cent lower). Purchases deemed “non essential” generally fell by more than 12 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

been attacked across the UK after conspiracy theories spread on social media claiming the virus was linked to the roll-out of 5G, despite scientists describing such a theory as “both a physical and biological impossibility” and the industry branding it “utter rubbish”.Facebook said\u0026nbspit has now directed more than two billion people to resources from official health authorities through its own information centre, and displayed warnings on around 40 million posts on the platform which had been rated at least partly false by fact-checkers.However, last week, research from industry regulator Ofcom suggested that nearly half of UK adults online had been exposed to false claims around the virus.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has also met internet giants – including Facebook – to urge a further clampdown on misinformation appearing online.“To date, we’ve also removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm,” Mr Rosen

But as part of new research, scientists were able to have another look at the information in the Kepler data and see that it really was a previously undiscovered planet.In fact, it is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature. While other exoplanets may be more similar in size or temperature, no world has been discovered that has quite such a combination of those two qualities, as well as lying in the habitable zone.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien lifeThe planet is 300 light-years from us, just a little larger than our Earth and receives about 75 per cent of the light that we get from our own Sun. That means the temperature could be similar, too, allowing for the conditions required for life.Scientists are concerned, however, that its star is a red dwarf, unlike our own more stable Sun. Such stars are known for throwing out stellar flare-ups that could destroy any potential life before it takes hold on the planet.Scientists now hope to learn more about the planet, including any information about its atmosphere and to get more specific knowledge of its size and conditions.This intriguing, distant world gives us even greater hope that a second Earth lies among the stars, waiting to be found,” said Thomas\u0026nbspZurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Following a quick check-up, the crew will be flown by helicopters to Baikonur, from where Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew\u0027s return.Morgan and Meir will have to be driven from Baikonur to Kyzyl-Orda, 190 miles away, to board a flight to the US - a strenuous journey made necessary by Kazakhstan\u0027s quarantine measures.On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first contagion at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of US, Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

He conducted seven space walks, four of which were to improve and extend the life of the station\u0027s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which looks for evidence of dark matter in the universe.Meir and Skripochka spent 205 days in space, with Meir carrying out the first three all-women spacewalks with her crewmate Christina Koch, who returned from space in February.Speaking from the orbiting outpost before the return to Earth, the crew said that coming back to the world drastically changed by the pandemic will be challenging.Morgan said the crew has tried to keep atop the coronavirus news, but added that it was hard to comprehend what was really going on.It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below, said Meir.We can tell you that the Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it\u0027s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place since both of us have been up here.A new crew comprising Nasa\u0027s Chris Cassidy and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner arrived at the station on April 9.They said before blast-off that they had been under a very strict quarantine for a month before the flight and were feeling good.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Moore has become a social media sensation after raising more than £15m for the NHS after successfully completing 100 laps around his garden.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn their Instagram, Smith appeared to reference their indifference to the backlash, writing: “Sending nothing but love to everyone out there today.”Smith previously earnt support from fans as a result of the Moore comparisons, with many invoking the “#BeKind” hashtag that proved momentarily popular in the wake of Caroline Flack’s death in January.Ellen crew ‘distressed and outraged’ amid shutdown, report claimsWhy is it still so unusual to see female masturbation on screen?Anna Calvi on why Jeff Buckley’s Grace feels like falling in love“People on Twitter using Capt Tom Moore’s remarkable achievement to have a go at … Sam Smith,” one Twitter user wrote. “How quickly everyone forgets about Caroline Flack.

London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan\u0026nbspsaid on Friday the total included 20 bus drivers who had lost their lives. “It breaks my heart,” he said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I will continue to do whatever it takes to keep our heroic transport workers as safe as possible,” said Mr Khan,\u0026nbspwho said middle-door boarding would “further protect drivers”.He added: “I would like to remind Londoners that you shouldn’t be travelling by any mode of transport unless it is absolutely necessary, and public transport is only open for critical workers.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastMr Khan also urged the government to change its advice to the public on wearing face masks to help combat the spread of the virus.The London mayor told BBC Breakfast on Friday that wearing non-medical facial masks, such as a bandana, scarf or reusable mask, would add “another layer of protection” to the public.Mr Khan, who wrote to transport secretary Grant Shapps about the issue, said he is lobbying for masks to be worn in circumstances where people cannot keep two metres apart, such as on public transport.TfL trialled the boarding change on 140 buses across nine routes, with the operator saying it was “confident” that the low number of people travelling meant people could keep a safe distance between each other.Limited use of London’s buses by essential workers had led the number of people travelling to “plummet” by about 85 per cent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But experts tell Jon Stone it still isn\u0027t clear to what extent pupils could spread coronavirusThe government is showing no sign of easing its coronavirus lockdown restrictions, with another extension to the measures confirmed on Thursday. But the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is reported to have privately made clear that if it were up to him, schools would be reopening at the first safe opportunity.The issue is contentious: the science of to what extent children contribute to the pandemic, and by how much, is uncertain. Childcare is becoming an issue for many parents who are not key workers and thus entitled to still send their children to class. And with what started as an extended Easter holiday is in danger of turning into several months off school, pupils are starting to miss out on serious amounts of education.“I suspect we might open schools again, partly because there is still debate about whether school closures are actually beneficial or not,” Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia tells The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We’ve not answered that, and there are very good reasons why school closures, in terms of the children, might actually not be that useful. And if they don’t get that ill, maybe they’re not that infectious – but it is a maybe.”This uncertainty is key to the question of how long this extended Easter break might turn out to be, and whether it starts to turn into a summer holiday before children go back to class.Police find 17 bodies piling up inside nursing home morgueNurses suspended after refusing to treat patients without N95 masksUK coronavirus hospital death toll rises to 13,729Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in disease modelling at the University of Warwick, tells The Independent that even if children are less effective vectors for the virus, the fact that so many of them would be crowded into schools could pose a risk.“The problem is there’s still an awful lot of uncertainty, and this is the real concern we have,” he says. “We know from the data coming in that children tend to have much more mild symptoms than the older age groups. Where there is still a lot of uncertainty is how much they transmit and this is a big concern.”Children themselves might not be getting sick, but could still be acting as carriers for the disease.“Even if someone is asymptomatic and has no symptoms at all it’s still possible they can transmit the virus. If someone has very clear symptoms and is coughing a lot they’re much more likely to transmit and spread droplets, so it’s very likely that people with very severe symptoms will have a higher transmission rate,” says Dr Tildesley.“But what we don’t know and what’s still uncertain is the role of these asymptomatic or mild cases in infection. This is the concern because of course even if that’s lower the fact that you’ve got a lot of children in one place is a concern.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith repeated government promises to ramp up Covid-19 testing falling short, there is very little data around about the extent to which people – never mind children – are even being asymptotically infected. Until that bottleneck is sorted, it will be hard to judge exactly how many people are carrying the virus. But with seriously ill people and NHS workers being prioritised for the limited number of tests, people with no symptoms are a long way down the list.The manner in which\u0026nbspthe lockdown\u0026nbspwas implemented\u0026nbspis also a problem, as it becomes difficult to separate out the different measures and tell which ones are making a difference.It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.“It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.”At this point, any decision to reopen schools, even if it was based on the available scientific evidence, would be a guess –\u0026nbspbecause there isn’t much scientific evidence yet available. But many teachers are worried about being flung into the classroom as an experiment when the science is not yet clear.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union tells The Independent\u0026nbspit would be reckless to put “political or business” considerations ahead of safety.“Everyone is anxious to return to normality as soon as possible, but decisions to either strengthen or loosen the current restrictions must always be governed by the medical and scientific evidence. Political or business considerations must never be allowed to override the safety of pupils, school staff and the wider community,” he says.“The NASUWT is committed to work with the government to protect public health and the health of our members who, along with other public service workers, are doing so much to help the country through this crisis.”One option being recommended by some epidemiologists is bringing schools back, but with specific social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus: setting desks further apart, closing playgrounds, asking children to keep their distance. Teachers could also be given protective equipment (PPE): another union, the National Education Union (NEU) has written to the prime minister asking him to base any decision to reopen partly on the “availability of appropriate PPE and enhanced levels of cleaning”.One study published in The Lancet medical journal, which looks at data from the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, suggests schools could come back earlier if students could be prevented from mixing and have social-distancing measures imposed during class.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered if restrictive social-distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time,” said Professor Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study.In Denmark, schools this week started to reopen in a staggered manner, with different arrival times and just the first five year groups plus kindergartens back for now. The youngest children are going back first because they are thought to be the least vulnerable to the virus and also the most difficult to arrange childcare for, keeping workers tied up looking after their families.But if the UK’s 506,400 full-time teachers are to be given protective equipment, the UK’s supply lines, already insufficient for NHS staff and care workers, are a long way off from being able to cope. And teachers say that there are other practical issues to consider.Katharine Birbalsingh, the high-profile headteacher of Michaela Community School in Brent, north London, has said\u0026nbspit was a “lie” that social distancing is possible in schools.“The fact is that social distancing in schools is simply impossible,” she said. “We’re considered to be the strictest school in Britain and even we would find it impossible.”Number of full-time teachers working in the UKMs Birbalsingh said\u0026nbspshe understood that “schools cannot stay closed for 10 months”, and that they might have to open eventually, but said the government should be upfront with teachers and the public about the risks.“Schools will open at some point, but what I don’t want is for people to perpetuate the lie –\u0026nbspand it is a lie – that social distancing is possible. It just isn’t,” she said.Staffing would also be an issue, the headteacher told the BBC, with supply teachers not an adequate replacement on such a grand scale.“The other thing to remember is that from the point of view of a head teacher, if you have to send home staff who have underlying issues, if you have to send home your staff who have a cough you are probably going to have fewer than half your staff in. So if you have half your staff in, how are you filling your classrooms with teachers? You can’t.“And you’ve got to think about the kind of chaos that then ensues in schools when children don’t have their own teachers – you have cover teachers, and we all know what you used to do in schools when you had a supply teacher.”Dr Tildesley also notes the problems, telling The Independent: “Possibly for secondary school children it’s easier to implement a policy like that for primary school, that’s a challenge –\u0026nbspI’ve got two six year olds, trying to explain to them the concept of going back to school but not hugging their friends is a real challenge. I think that’s difficult.”lockdown extended for three weeks, says Dominic RaabDespite these concerns, other countries in addition to Denmark are going ahead with reopening schools anyway. Germany announced on Wednesday that it would start opening schools early next month, and Austria and France have also set tentative timetables.Given the lack of clear information, this, says Dr Tildesley, could be “useful” for the UK authorities in deciding which way to go.“We are seeing other countries in Europe who have declared that they are going to start sending children back to school earlier than us. That will also give us some evidence,” he says.“It would be really informative to use to look at their epidemic curves and how they might change when children start to go back to school. Of course, every country is different but it would at least give us some evidence of what that effect might be.”But, he adds, evidence would take several weeks to filter through, given the virus’s incubation period – and if schools reopen at the same time as other measures are lifted it would be harder to disentangle the effect. It is for this reason that the European Commission has asked countries to leave gaps of weeks between phasing out different measures stating that “sufficient time should be left between the steps (eg one month), as the effect of their lifting can only be measured over time”. Whether member states, under domestic political pressure of their own, adhere to this will remain to be seen.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)“There is going to be something of a lag in that and two, three weeks really before we start to see strong evidence of what the effectiveness of that policy is,” Dr Tildesley said.If the government makes the leap to opening schools any time soon, it will be somewhat of an experiment.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the most vulnerable children and we have published guidance on how schools can employ social distancing during this period. We will only re-open schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so, and will consult closely with the sector on our approach.”“There’s always a trade off here,” says Dr Tildseley. “I accept this as an infectious disease modeller, we tend to be very focused on trying to minimise the risk to human health of the virus, but of course there is another aspect of this and it’s something I’m aware of: you can’t stay in a lockdown strategy forever.“If all we cared about was minimising deaths then essentially you would persist with lockdown. But there’s a practical side to it. At some point you’ve got to start to visit measures for lifting.“This becomes a really difficult political decision because you have the problem of if you open them and it’s deemed to be too soon and cases begin to climb again, you could start to lose public trust.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People are trying new things and noticing differences, at home, in their work and in communities. This is really apparent when it comes to food, farming and the countryside, the issues the Commission is focused on, but clear in other areas too.Alongside the emergency response, it is important keep track of these changes in what we’re doing and our collective mood, to help shape the kind of country we want to be, including the way want to feed ourselves, when we recover from this pandemic.”It comes after survey results suggested 1.5 million\u0026nbspacross the UK had gone hungry since the outbreak began, with a range of issues including access to funds and an inability to get items from shops leading a growing number of people to access foodbanks.Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, said: “The same poll that revealed this appetite for social change highlighted an alarming and worsening food insecurity crisis, with three million in Britain going hungry since lockdown began.“These figures create an imperative for reshaping the food system post-Covid-19 so that it delivers healthy diets for everyone, regardless of how much they earn.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Using data from the Office for National Statistics, the charity estimated this would amount to 1,696,000 million private renters in England.The organisation said that a growing number of people will be forced to rely on welfare payments for the first time due to covid-19, and urged the government to increase housing benefit so that it covers the average costs of local rents.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: London on lockdown Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks down a deserted Camden High StreetGoodge Street Station is one of the many stations closed to help reduce the spreadAn empty street in the heart of ChinatownPeople in masks in Chinatown a day after the lockdownA near-empty Piccadilly Circus during the first week of lockdownSonja, my neighbour, who I photographed while taking a short walk.

Renters’ unions and opposition parities have previously called on the government to suspend rents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Shelter’s chief executive Polly Neate praised the decision to temporarily suspend evictions during the pandemic, but added: “Millions of renters will be in dire straits further down the line without more government support.“As renters lose their jobs and see their incomes hit, many will have to rely on the welfare safety net for the first time. Our services are already hearing from families in homes they could comfortably afford under normal circumstances, who are now in serious financial difficulty.“We are facing an onslaught of people suddenly unable to afford their rent, at a time when people need to stay put and cannot safely move to a cheaper home.

Critics have blamed wet markets\u0026nbspwhere Chinese consumers buy live animals for enabling the crossover of the bacteria from wild populations.And doubts have been raised over the transparency shown by Chinese authorities on death rates and the geographical spread of the disease.Mr Raab, who is standing in for Boris Johnson while the prime minister recuperates from a bout of coronavirus,\u0026nbspsaid the UK has had good cooperation with China in relation to the return of UK nationals from Wuhan and the procurement of equipment.But he said: “I think there absolutely needs to be a very, very deep e after-the-event review of the lessons – including of the outbreak of the virus – and I don’t think we can flinch from that at all, it needs to be driven by the science.”He declined to speculate on the outcome of any review, saying: “We will look very carefully with all our the other international partners, and the World Health Organisation and other international organisations as to how this outbreak happened and what can be done to prevent it happening in the future.“Until we get those answers, we can’t really track a way forward.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because it’s what’s called relative risk. If you really feel that you don’t want to have any part of this virus, will you maintain six feet away, wear a mask, do all the things that we talk about in the guidelines?” Dr Fauci said, adding: “You know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks.

If you want to go a bit more intimate, then that’s your choice regarding a risk.”According to Dr Fauci, the decision whether or not to meet up with someone from a dating app becomes even trickier when considering that people who are asymptomatic are also spreading the virus.Explaining that it would be “much easier” if only people who were sick were contagious, Dr Fauci said: “But what we’re seeing, which becomes really problematic, is that there’s a considerable amount of transmission from an asymptomatic person.”Earlier in the interview, the White House coronavirus task force expert also cautioned against festivals such as Coachella in the future, explaining that it would make him “really nervous”.“Well, if there’s virus in the community, it makes me really, really nervous. Really nervous because outbreaks and clusters have been the things that have fuelled outbreaks in different cities throughout the world,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others said it was “natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat”.Alongside the popularity of southeast Asia’s wildlife markets selling a wide variety of animals for consumption, the trade in dog and cat meat has been rising over the past three years, the organisation says.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Before the outbreak, about 10 million dogs and cats were slaughtered for eating in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia every year, according to Four Paws.But its investigators said they had witnessed and heard how\u0026nbspsales of the meat in the region had risen during the global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The WHO\u0026nbspsaid that to prevent mass abandonment of pets –\u0026nbspbut it had the opposite effect.”Consumption had also risen because people staying at home want to try more “exotic” meat, Dr Polak said.In interviews last year, patients had told Four Paws how medical professionals had advised them to consume the meat for its “warming and healing properties” thought – falsely – to ward off flu viruses and the coronavirus.The meat is particularly recommended to women after giving birth and is said to increase blood flow for women during their menstrual cycle.Animals around the world benefit as coronavirus halts tourismBut a report\u0026nbsptwo months ago by the group, which has studied the trade in the three countries, concluded there was no evidence for any of the medical benefits claimed by health professionals.“Patients are routinely advised by health practitioners of the health benefits, and vendors are reporting to us that their customers are partaking in dog meat consumption due to the ‘health benefits’,” Dr Polak said, adding that she strongly suspected doctors were now recommending it\u0026nbspeven more in view of Covid-19.In Indonesia, people widely believe dog meat cures respiratory illness –\u0026nbsplargely asthma – so demand for it in that country could soar, Dr Polak said.The animals may be strays or stolen pets, or are bought by traders\u0026nbspwho exchange them for pots and pans.Vendors in Cambodia and Vietnam stand in masks at the roadside, providing bags of the meat, which may be cooked on the spot or for customers to take home.Dogs and cats blowtorched alive at Indonesian street marketsCambodia’s capital Phnom Penh has more than 110 dog meat restaurants, many of which opened within the past\u0026nbsptwo years, Four Paws says.Since the coronavirus pandemic, the organisation’s teams found that a few had closed but most had switched to providing takeaway services.And restaurants across the country are advertising dog and cat meat dishes for delivery on food delivery websites and apps.“This is concerning because we had never seen dog and cat meat dishes being advertised on a food delivery app before the Covid-19 outbreak. It demonstrates that the dog-meat industry is adapting to the increased consumption at home and increased ease of obtaining dog and cat meat, even during a lockdown,” said Dr Polak.“The insanitary conditions of the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many different animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases\u0026nbsplike Covid-19.“The rampant trade and live animal markets across southeast Asia are ticking time bombs. If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.”Last week China\u0026nbspclassified dogs as pets, not livestock, for the first time – a move campaigners hope could signal an end to that country’s dog and cat meat trade.Four Paws, which is campaigning for a total ban on dog and cat meat, has long warned of the risk of the spread of rabies from the pet meat trade.The news comes as The Independent’s Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign calls for an international effort to tighten restrictions on wet markets to reduce the risk of future pandemics.A recent study has proposed that the virus might have travelled from bats to humans via stray dogs.cat and dog meat\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the refugee camp when it was time for the baby to be born I went into labour. I tried to give birth in my shelter but I could not. My son died soon after he was born. The doctors said it was the stress of the journey.’ Zaheda worries about the safety of her daughters Gulsar*, 20, and Abeda*, 18, as there are reports of trafficking in the camps, so she accompanies them everywhere, even to the toilet318 Arofa* and her best friend Rashida*Arofa*, six years old, one of Zaheda’s younger daughters, and her best friend Rashida*  share a moment in the refugee camp. Arofa lives with her eight siblings, mother, father and grandmother Nur Begum, in a three-roomed shelter made of tarpaulin and bamboo418 Ummee* is a 16-year old girl who arrived in Bangladesh with her brother, orphanedUmmee Salma*, 16: ‘Me and my older brother came here four months ago. My parents are either killed or lost. When violence broke out we were separated. I heard them screaming our names but we couldn’t find each other. That was the last time I saw them. If my parents were alive they would have come and found us in Bangladesh’Almost 1 million people, mainly women and children, are now living in the sprawling refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, making it now the largest refugee camp in the world‘If the people of Save the Children hadn’t helped me when I was unconscious I would have died,’ says Rohana*. Rohana Begum* was alone in her shelter made of wood and plastic sheeting when she went into labour with Khotija*, now two and a half months. After delivering the baby on her own Rohana* began to lose a lot of blood. She lay unconscious and haemorrhaging until her mother-in law returned a few hours later. Save the Children estimates that 48,000 babies were born in the camps around Cox’s Bazar in 2018Allison JoyceSave the ChildrenWomen in the camps face many issues in addition to the extreme sexual and physical violence they experienced as they fled, they are still vulnerable in the camps. Many are alone, or just with their children, and overcrowding and limited privacy means that they are at further risk of violence, sexual abuse, child abuse, human trafficking and exploitation818 Marjina*, 25, with her 2 month old daughter Asma, in their tent in Balukhali refugee camp“I was eight months pregnant when they came. It was just before918 Sajeda Begum*, 35 (on the left), is married with five childrenShe has become firm friends with Sobika* (right) since meeting her at the ActionAid women-friendly space where they have been encouraged to talk. A girl sells vegetables in Kutupalong refugee camp. There are currently 6,000 unaccompanied children living in Cox’s Bazar, where they face crippling food shortages and are at risk of exploitation and abuse. Whilst looking for work women and girls are falling victim to exploitation and are being trafficked into the sex tradeIsamatara takes part in a session run by Plan International in Balukhali camp, Cox’s Bazar, for teenage girls to talk about what it’s like to have their periods in a place like this. Girls are usually married within two to three years after they start menstruating, between the ages of 12 to 161218 Rojia*, 25, with her youngest son Sultan*, 2Rojia’s husband went missing in Myanmar. She thinks he was picked up by the military. He went out for a walk after lunch and never returned. Single mothers whose husbands are missing or dead head up 1 in 6 families in the Rohingya camps. They face particularFatima’s* husband was killed in the attacks and shortly after their house was burnt. Since Fatima is head of the household, she has to do most of the work. From one of the nearby water pumps in the camp she usually fetches water in the evenings. Care provides her with safe drinking water and washing facilities, critical for the 22,000 people in her camp. ‘No aid in the world can give me back my husband’‘Look at my feet. I had lost my toe nails as we were climbing. It was so hard to climb over the mountains and we had to carry our old mother because she can’t walk,’ says Fatima*Dr Fatema Akter, 42, one of ActionAid’s team in Cox’s Bazar, says that when the crisis started she saw 80 people a day. ‘At the beginning, most of the women came with reproductive problems because they had to walk a long time when they were crossing the border. Sometimes they were a few weeks pregnant, but when walking on this journey they were bleeding and it turned out they miscarried. There are also many rape cases. I try to understand my patients when I see them. A common problem is women being beaten by their husbands in the camp. And another problem is women being left by their husbands. To focus myself and try to hold back my tears, sometimes I try to remember my favourite films, or think about fun moments with my friends’Dildar Begum, 25, lost her husband as she fled to save herself and her children’s lives. After reaching Jamtoli camp she was reunited with her husband and they started living happily together. But soon he started abusing her physically and emotionally. She then discovered he had a new wife, occasionally he returned to torture her further, but now he doesn’t come at all. She is pregnant again, a single mother of six children, and delivered her last baby all alone in the camp. ‘It’s very difficult to explain the struggle I’ve faced in Myanmar and throughout my journey towards Bangladesh. I was five months pregnant and alone with my five children.’  ‘When I lost my two children, I wanted to climb into the hole with them and lay there. Though I’m sad, it’s very important to tell our terrible story to the whole world. One of my children was killed crossing the border, she was 11. My other child was only seven. When we crossed it was very cold and raining, we didn’t have enough food so my child got sick and was taken by disease.’1818 Minara, 20, with baby ShomimaShomima was seven days old when the photo was taken. ‘One day, if it’s safe, of course we want to go home. I miss my home, my family. I miss my cows and my normal life. But at least this is safer,’ she says. In October 2018, a proposed repatriation deal was made between the Bangladesh and Myanmar governments. The deal was made against the wishes of many Rohingya, some of whom spoke of being ‘terrified’ at being sent back. As a result of mounting concern amongst NGOs, human rights groups and the UNHCR, repatriation did not take place at this time. For now the Rohingya remain in limbo just across the border from Myanmar, and for women and girls in the camps of Cox’s Bazar life remains precariousThe dangerous crossings will likely continue as long as the issues the Rohingya face in Bangladesh and Myanmar remain,\u0026nbspMs Rayburn, from Save the Children, cautioned.“Very often when we see these upticks in Rohingya and Bangladeshis trying to take these routes to either Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia, the response is to focus on\u0026nbspshoring up borders and coast guards to prevent these attempts from happening, but they will continue to happen for as long as the root causes of why people feel compelled to leave are still there.“When we’ve spoken to Rohingya, it comes up many times that the reason they feel compelled to take this journey, which is incredibly dangerous, is because they don’t see any future in the camps.“The conditions are unsafe and unsanitary, and\u0026nbsptheir children have limited access to school. As long as those conditions are not addressed, and as long as they can’t go home because Myanmar hasn’t resolved the root causes in Rakhine state, it would be very difficult to prevent people from taking this kind of action.”She added: “A couple of Rohingya I spoke to in February who had been on a boat that capsized\u0026nbspsaid they planned to attempt to go again as soon as they can, because they couldn’t see any options for themselves in Cox’s Bazar.“It will keep happening as long as we don’t find a solution for the Rohingya.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Half of those , deaths are blamed on coronavirus.We do not know how the other half died, although some will have missed le-saving healthcare because of the ­pandemic.What we do know is that this hideous virus is killing the economy.The Office for Budget Responsibilitywarns a three-month shutdown will slash growth by more than a third, push unemployment up by two million and raise borrowing by an eye-watering  per cent.Lockdown has destroyed Britain’s “jobs miracle”, put paid to a fragile “Brexit bounce” and triggered what could be the worst depression in living memory.“It is important people know there will be hardship ahead,” warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak, an under- statementever there was one.On your one-hour daily exercise break, you can see the tragedy unfolding.Once-thriving restaurants and bars, busy offices and shops and key construction sites are locked and bolted.Behind every door is a personal and economic tragedy.Despite a torrent of taxpayers’ cash unleashed by Mr Sunak, many will never reopen. Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come. Some of it will be paid for in blood.Without cash from tax revenues, how do we meet Sunak’s pledge to fund — “whatever it takes” — our wonderful NHS and its costly new le-saving treatments The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCan we afford a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state, good schools or the promised infrastructure linking North and South with better roads and railways One day a vaccine will bring this miserable pandemic to an end. But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity. There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished. It leaves headroom for ato work and school.The sooner that begins, the sooner we will see the “rapid bounce back” forecast by the OBR.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We sing very close to each other and partner dance and there’s even kissing – and then there were the packed audiences too.When they made the decision to shut down it was still a major shock.As a single mum without much financial help I was scared we’d be out on the street. I have a friend who works at Sainsbury’s and she hooked me up with a job two weeks ago and I absolutely love it.The people I work with are genuine and lovely and I plan on staying as long as they’ll have me. It’s not as much as the West End would pay, but I am just starting out.I do nine-hour shts starting at am, working the tills, manning the queue, helping the online team – very dferent from my usual job. I spend most of those hours on my feet working and it’s exhausting.But I feel proud when I can help someone find what they’re looking for and don’t have to ask a colleague. Everyone at Sainsbury’s is like family and they’ve really welcomed me in.Obviously it’s far less glamorous than starring in the West End but I enjoy the challenge of learning new skills and working with people.I look forward to the theatres re-opening and getting back to singing on stage but for now I’m happy to just sing in the aisles!But Jenner isnt the only Brit to have swapped the spotlight for a new job during this pandemic.Keegan Brown, , from Carisbrook in the Isle of Wight is the th best player in the country.He has put his darts career on hold and taken on extra shts as an assistant in an NHS blood-science lab.While playing on the PDC pro tour – a series of darts tournaments for professional players – I tried to work three days a week in my lab assistant job, he tells Sun Online.This would normally consist of two full days am to .pm and one day from am to pm. But since the darts calendar has been put on hold I’ve been doing a minimum of five days and the hours can be anything now, including night shts and also on-call days.I figurethe NHS can use my skill set to help or support the service, then I want to offer anything I can to help in the midst of this pandemic. We have all been up-skilling too, to help backfill when people are being forced to take time off.The NHS has always had a family-feel but even more so now as we’re working under such dferent circumstances, something I’ve never experienced.My we Roz is extremely proud of me but also very worried. She worries about everyone!But I am so lucky to love both of my jobs. They come with highs and lows and there are times I prefer one to the other, but overall they both make me happy.The darts is more full-on, intense and competitive and you’re mostly judged on the last game you played.It can be an emotional rollercoaster and you do have to learn to grow a thicker skin.Working for the NHS can also be full-on and intense but you’re working as part of a team – rather than on your own - and you do feel like you’re making a dference.I’m not practicing my darts as much as I’d like to, but I am still keeping my arm in as much as possible.

The academy contacted me and I was happy to help!Leivi Saltman, , from North East London, is a professional photographer - but is now working at a greengrocers.I’ve been a professional photographer for six years and cover everything from engagements and weddings to charity and corporate events, he tells us.A typical day is editing photos, keeping my social media updated and going on location visits to scout out a venue so I can figure out lighting and places to get the best angles and atmosphere.Then in the evenings I’m usually out photographing events.When I first started hearing about the virus, there wasn’t a massive effect on my work and only one or two jobs were cancelled. But once the government ruled there should be no public gatherings, that pretty much tied my hands. Twenty-five events were cancelled or postponed, which was the majority of my events leading up to July.A friend of mine put a post on Facebook that a local greengrocers were looking for help and I thought, ‘Why not I am earning less compared to my photography, but it helps to structure my day and gets me out the house. It’s a full-on day starting at am and finishing at around pm.My typical day is unloading the lorry, which is full of fresh fruit and vegetables bought from the market that morning at am.Once the lorry is unloaded and put in the fridge, the remaining tasks include stocking up the shop, putting together customer orders and making sure there aren’t any empty shelves or shelves low in produce.There’s a lot more manual labour involved than in photography, but it’s surprised me how much I’ve really enjoyed it.I like meeting new people each day and being a part of a team rather than working on my own. It feels like I’ve become a part of their family and I’ve learnt a lot about dferent types of fruit and vegetables and how you should store them.Of course, I’ll be going back to photography when the crisis is over, but I will miss the greengrocers too.

They are:He added that the UK was still on course to take three months to come out of the current peak — taking the lockdown to June.Experts also warned some social distancing measures could stay in place until a vaccine is found, which could take up to  months.While the disease is still spreading fast in some areas, the contagion rate nationwide is now below R, where each sufferer passes it to less than one person.Insisting Britain was at “a delicate and dangerous stage” of this pandemic, Mr Raab told the No press conference: “We need to be patient a while longer. If we rush to relax the measures in place, we would risk wasting all the sacrices and all the progress we have made.“We’ve just come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, we’ve already sacriced far too much to ease up now.”He added: “It’s been an incredible national team effort. Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance.“Let’s stick together, let’s see this through.”Despite other European countries easing measures, Mr Raab refused to set out any timeline on when the lockdown will end — dubbing that “irresponsible”.But he did offer a grim insight into government thinking that it could last into June. He said Boris Johnson’s scenario from March  of “three months to come through the peak is broadly still the outline”.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe Cabinet and the Government’s COBRA emergency committee both met yesterday to rubber-stamp the extension.But Mr Raab and No came under increasing pressure yesterday to devise a proper lockdown exit strategy.Echoing calls from some frustrated ministers, government ­scientic adviser Professor Neil Ferguson accused No of being too slow so far.He called for a special coronavirus department — modelled on the Brexit ministry — to ensure turbo-charged preparations.The scientist said: “I would like to see action accelerated, and real progress made. We need to put in place a command and control infrastructure, a novel organisation for this. There needs to be more coordination.”Prof Ferguson added: “The cost of the lockdown to the economy is billions of pounds a day. It’s a small price to pay.”A health minister also broke ranks to declare that social distancing restrictions are likely to last for more than a year.Nadine Dorries tweeted: “There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a ­balance between the health of the nation and our economy.“The introduction of a relaxation easement strategy eventually leads to a full exit.”She was backed by Prof ­Ferguson, who warned of “a signicant level of social distancing probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available”.Mr Raab also said there must eventually be a reckoning with China, calling for “a very, very deep e” into the outbreak.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer gave his full support for the lockdown’s extension.But he wanted more clarity about “what plans are being put in place to lt the lockdown when the time is right”.SUBSTITUTE PM Dominic Raab yesterday beamed in to a virtual G meeting to work out a global response to the coronavirus crisis.He joined Donald Trump, Angela Merkel and other world leaders to discuss how the world economy can get back up and from its knees after the global lockdown.Mr Raab – who is standing in for Bojo while he recovers from Covid – logged into the video call from a No briefing room.The crunch talks came after the US President sparked global fury by axing funding to the World Health Organisation in the middle of the deadly pandemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that’s OK.In fact, it’s more than OK. It means freedom and travelling and seeing people.The messaging has been so strong because the Government, in the early days of this pandemic, predicted the British public would be very bad at following such draconian rules.After all, we’re a country of liberty-loving, anti-authority types who want control over our own lives.Government forecasts predicted  per cent of folk would still go to work and  per cent of kids would still show up at school.It’s been nowhere near that. We have behaved.And our collective obedience when it came to lockdown — not easy for so many folk cooped up in small flats — was only hardened when we saw the man we have entrusted with our health over this period knocked down himself.If big, bouncy, bold Boris could end up in intensive care, so too could our dad or brother or best friend — or even us.That’s why it’s concerning that many political insiders suggest the Government is waiting for public opinion to lead us out of lockdown.Trust me, that’s not going to happen. We are waiting on our leaders to talk us through where we go from here. We will listen with the right degree of scepticism and change our behaviour accordingly.That’s how we went from a nation of pub-frequenting, sport and concert obsessives to million people who happily down pint after pint on the couch while quizzing our friends on Zoom.We’re going to have to be sensible and brave in the coming weeks.And there will be many aspects to this new way of living that we should all try to embrace.Respect the need for folk to have more personal space no acceptance of filthy habits such as spitting on the streets or coughing into others’ faces on the bus an acknowledgement that people who are ill must recuperate at home and spend their recovery working from home in many jobs.The best-case scenario: Post-corona society in  will herald a new era to live more healthily and respectfully.SOME irony that ITV’s best show in years is Quiz – a drama going behind the scenes of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , the series that propelled the broadcaster into the Noughties with gusto and reinvigorated the entire UK telly industry.I came away believing that hapless and likeable Major Charles Ingram, played by Matthew Macfadyen was clearly wrongly convicted.He deserves to be handed his £million.

which resemble a large cotton bud - from deep inside the nose and throat before being sent off to a lab for testing.Most labs use a method called the polymerase chain reaction , which takes several hours to get a result.It can take days for labs to run the tests and tell people their result.Several companies are working on ways to fast track this type of testing.What is an antibody test When a person gets infected with antigen, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies in response - as a way to fight the infection.After they recover, those antibodies float in the blood for months, maybe even years.Thats the bodys way of defending itself in case it becomes infected with the virus again.So an antibody test specically looks for antibodies which will be able to tell whether youve already been exposed to Covid-.Anyone who has already had the illness is presumed to be immune to getting it again - at least, in the intermediate term.This would allow them to go back to work safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely to become infected again or pass the virus on.The check that has been developed for Covid- is a finger-prick blood test, with the samples sent to laboratories and results available within a few days.Dr Hilary Jones, a GP and resident doctor on Good Morning Britain, explained that it works almost like a pregnancy test, except you need a drop of blood.These tests are being developed by several dferent firms and Public Health Englandis also working on its own test.They still need to be validated to ensure they give accurate resultsThe Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he wants to gradually tone down the idolization of the two late leaders as it goes against his agenda to brand the North as a normal state.Another North Korean observer noted that the country had an unusually low-key commemoration for the national holiday this year.“This could be part of North Korea’s ongoing propaganda effort to distance Kim Jong Un from the legacies of his grandfather and his father, a trend detected since the latter half of last year, the North’s handling of the party founding anniversary in October  being one example,” Minyoung Lee, an expert in North Korean media and leadership, told NK News.Foreign experts have challenged the claim that there is not one single coronavirus infection on North Korean soil.Its impossible for North Korea not to have a single case of coronavirus, Jung H Pak, a former CIA analyst on North Korea, previously told Fox News.As of Thursday morning, there were at least ,, positive cases of Covid- and at least , deaths worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.At the end of March, The Sun reported that more than  North Korean smuggling ships were anchored offshore as Kim Jong-un fears they may bring in coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan calls all brits face masks","story":"SADIQ Khan has called for all Brits to wear face masks on public transport after  bus drivers die.The London Mayor said it could help slow the spread of the deadly virus for those still using buses and tubes.Mr Khan said protective measures for Londons bus drivers had gone above and beyond expert and Government advice.It was announced yesterday passengers would only be able to board buses through the middle doors of buses, to help keep drivers safe. The London Mayor told Sky News he is lobbying to change the advice on wearing face masks, because they could stop infected people who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic from passing on the virus.Mr Khan said: What I am lobbying for is when it comes to those circumstances when it is just not possible to keep your social distance - think of public transport, think of when youre in a shop.For people to wear a non-medical facial covering,a bandana, or a scarf, or a reusable facial mask.The reason why its important, although it may not stop you catching the virus.. it may stop you passing on the virus.What were seeing ispeople are not using clinical medical face masks, but actually making it themselves...they are more effective than not wearing one in relation to passing on the virus.He said his advice was not against the official advice from the World Health Organisation.Medical grade personal protective equipment should be reserved for health care workers, Mr Khan said.If other people used them it could be counterproductive and dangerous, he said.But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said this morning Mr Khans advice shouldnt be heeded.He told LBC: It is not the right moment to instruct people, as I saw the London Mayor do this morning, to wear themwe are not certain yet that they are going to be advantageous.Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said yesterday experts were still actively reviewing whether official advice should tell Brits to wear masks.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealIt comes after Dominic Raab yesterday extended the UK’s measures by a further three weeks.According to the Daily Mail, one idea favoured by the government for when Britain begins to lt its lockdown is the use of protective equipment at work.Those working indoors - including office and factory workers - could be ordered to socially distance and to wear face masks and gloves, the paper says.Mr Khan stressed wearing masks should not replace social distancing, but should be used where people are still having to leave home to go to work.The British government has been reluctant to take up the trend - favoured by many countries across Asia even before the lockdown, and now mandatory in America - citing a lack of evidence.London Assembly Member and Mayoral Candidate Shaun Bailey said Mr Khan had failed to provide his own Transport for Londonworkers with PPE.He said: The Mayor of London is also the chairman of TfL, and his failure to provide transport workers with PPE is putting lives at risk.In fact, London’s transport workers are now  times more likely to die from Coronavirus than NHS staff.“Instead of blaming the government and demanding more power, he should use the power he already has.If he wanted to, he can start tomorrow by sourcing PPE for all , of the transport staff who work for him. My team have sourced a supplier that can provide enough PPE for every TfL worker for  days, and I’ve written to the Mayor to offer my help. All he needs to do is pick up the phone.But new research suggests wearing masks can help ease the lting of strict lockdown measures, and stop those infected with coronavirus from passing it on.A cabinet source told the Daily Mail: Everyone accepts – including industry – that the next phase is not going to be ato business as usual.We will need intensive testing and tracing of suspected cases.And we will have to have social distancing in factories and offices – we will need personal protective equipment in the workplace.The source added that failure to do so could see a second lockdown, echoing Mr Raabs comments throughout the daily coronavirus press conferences.First Secretary of State, Mr Raab - who is deputising for the Prime Minister as he recovers from coronavirus - has repeatedly told Brits we must not give coronavirus a second chance.Experts also warned some social distancing measures could stay in place until a vaccine is found, which could take up to  months.Insisting Britain was at “a delicate and dangerous stage” of this pandemic, Mr Raab told the No press conference: “We need to be patient a while longer.

The Labour leader said ministers are failing to take decisions on when and how tothe UK to normal le - and suggested the government has not acted “quickly enough” throughout the crisis.Mr Starmer has been calling for the government to set out details of how the government plans to release the UK from lockdown.Mr Starmer told the BBC’s Coronavirus Podcast: “I think that throughout this theyaposve struggled with taking decisions quickly enough.“The other factor though, I think, is we all know that the Prime Minister has been in hospital. “Weaposve all been pleased to see that heaposs come out and is feeling better. And it feels as though theyaposve been in a position probably for a week or  days now where itaposs been dficult for the Government to make big decisions. And I think thereaposs a bit of that lying behind this as well.  He added: “I suspect, although I donapost know, that Dominic Raab is just reluctant - he probably does know that itaposs time for an exit strategy - but heaposs probably reluctant to sign it off without the Prime Minister and I think thereaposs a bit of that in the mix.”Asked about Mr Starmer’s comments, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “I don’t know that that’s fair. I think we’re all right now struggling with unprecedented circumstances, and we’re trying to plot a way through it.” But she added the Prime Minister’s convalescence “doesn’t make it any easier.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps branded the claim “completely untrue”.He said: I was surprised to see that being said for the simple reason that yesterday alone I attended cabinet, I attended the Cobra [meeting]...I attended two or even three of the cabinet subcommittees that are making all of the day to day decisions.Itaposs simply not the case that everythingaposs on standstill. There would be no dference to those decisions because we have been guided by, as I keep saying, the scientists and the medical advice, whether or not the PM had been in the room or not in the room in this instance because this is a disease which does not look to politicians to decide how to respond, it responds to science.So thataposs not the case at all and I hope we can continue withy the very impressive cross-party and indeed national effort with this virus and not turn it into those kind of discussions.

Boris Johnsonaposs stand-in Dominic Raab confirmed the drastic measures will go on another three weeks, until May  at the earliest. That means police can still fine groups of two or more people for gathering outside, unless theyaposre from the same household. And you can only leave home with a reasonable excuse - shopping for necessities, exercise once a day, a medical need or work where you have to. But todayaposs extension doesnapost mean that the lockdown will end on May . Mr Raab said the overallof the lockdown could be around three months and warned it might only be adjusted rather than lted altogether. That means while schools may reopen in May or June, working from home could continue for a year. So what does todayaposs decision mean - and how and when might the government start shting restrictions in the next few weeks  Hereaposs what you need to know.How long is the UKaposs lockdown extension  The UK coronavirus lockdown has legally been extended until it is next up for review, on May .  According to the Health Protection Regulations , Health Secretary Matt Hancock must review the emergency powers every three weeks.  Does this mean the lockdown ends on May   No. You should not look at the three-week extension and think that means it will all be over in three weeks. May  was only chosen because that is theof time for each review period, stated by the law. The government can announce on May  that it is extending the lockdown - either wholly or partly - for another three weeks. Or technically the government can choose to review the measures before three weeks are up . In other words, the May  date is totally arbitrary - despite the fact it sits conveniently just before the May  VE Day bank holiday.  When will the lockdown end  Dominic Raab warned the lockdown could go on for around three months in total. Askedit would take three weeks or three months for restrictions to be eased, he said: “The Prime Minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak - and I think that broadly is still the outline.” He said government advisors SAGE will review the latest lockdown extension by the end of the month. We simply donapost know yet though. The lockdown can only end when the UK is well past the peak of coronavirus cases and deaths. Government advisors believe we may now be at that peak or slightly past it, but itaposs too early to say. If we lt too early the virus will run rampant, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock.   How will the lockdown end   The lockdown is very unlikely to be lted in one go. It will be removed a little bit of the time to prop up the economy while protecting peopleaposs lives. Mr Raab was careful to focus on “adjustments” to the lockdown rather than axing it, and said we may eventually transition out of where we are. When there is a change, he said, it could involve relaxing measures in some areas while strengthening measures in other areas. Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said some measures may have to continue until we have a vaccine - which could be a year away. He said: There may be a number of measures that need to continue in order to allow [the virus] to be suppressed and controlled whilst vaccines and therapeutics come along.  What is the government looking for to end the lockdown  Dominic Raab set out five tests that the evidence must show before lting any lockdown. The government needs to be convinced that:The NHS is able to cope There is a sustained and consistent fall in death Infections are decreasing to manageable levels Testing and PPE numbers are adequate across the country Any adjustment wonapost risk a second peak of infectionsIn what ways might restrictions be lted  Travel to outdoor spacescould be one of the first restrictions lted - as long as social distancing is properly adhered to. And schools could re-open as it is vital they take the strainparents are to go back to work. But visiting loved ones in care homes could be off the table for some time, as could reopening pubs and restaurants. And chief scientic advisor Sir Patrick Vallance indicated working from home may be one thing that has to stay in place until we get a vaccine.Ministers are looking at a range of options. Itaposs understood theyaposre considering a plan to let younger people out of lockdown earlier than older people, because they are generally less at risk and prop up the economy. Ministers are also looking at plans to reopen coffee shops or hair salons, for example, by broadening the current list of essential shops. And they are looking at the idea of a phasedto school, with classrooms outside worst-hit London and Birmingham reopening earlier than in the cities. But no final decisions have been taken.  "},{"url":null,"title":"uk coronavirus lockdown last until","story":"NewsUK coronavirus lockdown may last until June - and could even be strengthenedFirst Secretary of State Dominic Raab said the broad outline is it will take three months from mid-March to come through the peak of Covid-.

Dominic Raab said the broad outline is it will still take around three months from mid-March to come through the peak of the virus.Government advisors have warned the lockdown cannot be lted until the UK is well past the peak. The First Secretary of State signalled that even when restrictions change, they are unlikely to be lted altogether all in one go. Instead he focused on what he called “adjustments” to the lockdown. Mr Raab told the daily No press conference: It could involve relaxing measures in some areas while strengthening measures in other areas. It came as the lockdown was extended by its first legally-required three week period to May . Government advisors SAGE will review the latest lockdown extension by the end of the month. But Mr Raab gave no signal they would be eased or lted altogether at that point. Askedit would take three weeks or three months for restrictions to be eased, he said: “The Prime Minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak - and I think that broadly is still the outline.” Mr Raab emphasised the UK could transition out of lockdown rather than just ending it. He said: “We’ve been very clear that we’ll take the right decisions at the right moments based on the evidence. And they may well involve a transition out of the current measures.” Boris Johnson introduced the strict curbs on le in the UK on  March, as the government sought to limit the spread of the virus.Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks.And today after meeting the government’s scientic advisors SAGE and the COBRA emergency committee, the First Secretary of State confirmed that Britainaposs lockdown would continue for  three   weeks.Any change would have to go through the government’s scientic advisors SAGE and the COBRA emergency committee. The extension means that the lockdown will be assessed again on May , raising hopes that the lockdown may be lted by VE Day on May .But a top scientist warned that the UK must keep a signicant level of social distancing until a vaccine for coronavirus is found. Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC there was little leeway to relax measures without something... in their place - such as testing and contact tracing. Britain’s coronavirus death toll has risen to more than , after  more deaths were reported in the last  hours. Another  patients died in hospitals in England. Scotland reported  new deaths as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there were fresh signs the lockdown was working, but also warned: “We are by no means through this yet.” Wales reported  more deaths and  were recorded in Northern Ireland. The death toll stood at , on Wednesday. Despite agreeing to this extension there are believed to be extensive ides inside the Cabinet, with Treasury ministers warning that the economic impact of an extended closure could create a nightmare scenario for the British economy. Earlier this week the Office for Budget Responsibility said that the economy could shrink by %the lockdown lasted three months. To aid the fightback the government is rapidly trying to expand its testing facilities - with a pledge to reach , tests a day by the end of the month. It is also developing a mobile app which could make contact tracing easier - but only% of smartphone users download it when it is available. But the government has missed its target to reach , coronavirus tests a day as more than half of capacity lies unfilled. A statement on March  said testing would be ramped up to , a day “within four weeks” - which came to an end yesterday. But as of am yesterday, , tests had been carried out in Britain in the previous  hours. At no point has the number topped ,. That is despite Downing Street saying today that total daily testing capacity is now over ,. A silver lining emerged after it was suggested that schools outside coronavirus hotspots such as London and Birmingham may open as soon as next month. Ministers are considering proposals to open some primary and nursery schools away from the big cities from May, The Times has reported. Healthy young adults couldto work and children would head back to school under the plans.

The scientic advice is clear. If we were to lt the restrictions now, we would risk undoing all the good work achieved so far. It is thanks to a collective national effort that the rate of infections has slowed and the NHS has been able to cope with the crisis. Another few weeks of social distancing is a price worth payingit saves lives. But it will also require more sacrices for many people. This will be especially tough for families in high-rise buildings or those in the high-risk category. Others will be worried about being separated from loved ones, or whether they will still have a job to go to when all this is over. The Government insists there is light at the end of the tunnel, yet has so far failed to spell out how we will emerge from isolation. The country has shown remarkable resilience so far. If ministers want that to continue they need to say what the exit strategy entails. Pressure is on Matt Hancock today snapped at journalists for daring to question the Government’s response to the crisis. The Health Secretary claimed the questions were beginning to irritate the public.  Butit were not for the media highlighting how care homes were hotbeds for the virus, ministers might not have taken action. Too few care workers were being tested, PPE was scarce and too many residents were dying. A free press will cheer governments when they get things right and hold them to account when they get things wrong. And that means asking hard questions of ministers who stand accused of having failed to protect the people they are there to serve.

The Duchess of Cambridge said extra recognition for the hardworking lesavers at the forefront of the crisis is the one of the main positives that you can take from this. The senior royal was speaking to the BBCaposs Tina Daheley alongside Prince William about a new phase of the government campaign Every Mind Matters. The Public Health England scheme is focused on looking after peopleaposs mental wellbeing during the Covid- pandemic. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.A video narrated by the Cambridges is set to be broadcast across national TV channels and social media from Monday, April . With the words “we’re in this together”, the couple herald the campaign which includes new NHS expert tips and advice on looking after mental wellbeing and supporting your family and loved ones during the crisis. In the interview, which broadcast this morning, Ms Daheley asks William: How are you helping get the message out there with Every Mind Matters  The duke said the scheme - which is in its second guise following feedback from the NHS and ious case studies - is now more important than ever in the current climate in guiding people on their mental health.We felt very strongly that now more than ever this was a vital tool and a vital service that people could easily access at home to guide them and give them just some very basic tips to mind their mental health, to mind their mental wellbeing through this process, he said. I think again staying connected, staying positive and being able to talk to friends and family is so crucial and having just some tips and some ideas as to how to tackle some of these strange feelings and dficult circumstances we’re finding ourselves in is really important.  Just to nudge us through these next few weeks, he added.William went on to say while NHS workers are used to dealing...with very sad situations the scale and speed of the current crisis in hospitals will be taking its toll on their mental health. He said for doctors and nurses having to see patients dying with no family members around them must be very dficult. They are there right next to the bedsides, looking after and caring for each and every patient in a critical condition and I think they take away that pain and that sometimes that fear and loneliness that these patients have to go through.  They’re the ones who absorb that and take it home to their families and I think again...that happening to somebody is not normal and we’re not superhuman any of us.So, to be able to manage those emotions and that feeling is going to take some time after all this is over as well, added the prince. Ms Daheley asked Kate: Do you think this will fundamentally change who we are and what we value  The duchess said absolutely, adding that the country is now seeing that frontline workers are doing the most extraordinary job and thataposs really coming to the forefront. I think it’s going to dramatically change how we all value and see our frontline workers and I think that is one of the main positives that you can take from this. They do an extraordinary job, it goes unrecognised daily and now I think all of us as a nation can really see how hard they work and how vital their work is, she added.

Professor Anthony Costello, of University College London#xs Institute for Global Health, told a committee of MPs that the #xCharsh reality#xD is that #xCwe were too slow with a number of things#xD. He said we could see , deaths in the UK. #xCIf we#xre going to suppress the chain of transmission of this virus in the next stage we all hope that the national lockdown and social distancing will bring about a large suppression of the epidemic so far - but we#xre going to face further waves,#xD he said. #xCAnd so we need to make sure that we have a system in place that cannot just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory, but has a system at district and community level.#xD Prof Costello, giving evidence to the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, said we #xCshould not have any blame at this stage#xD but that #xCwe can make sure in the second wave we#xre not too slow#xD.

Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt had askeda drugwas concluded to be safe, whether the UK would #xCshortcut#xD the normal processes in order to put orders in and get it out quickly. Mr Hancock said: #xCThe principles are that of course we want to get the very best treatment to the people who need them and we will follow the science. #xCAnd the science is best supported by having rigorous analysis of which drugs work and thus far there have not been any clinical trials that I am aware of around the world that have conclusively proved the value of these dferent drugs. #xCHowever, we have started to use them on patients here in the UK because the early evidence, which is not veried evidence, shows that they have some value. #xCBut all drugs also have downsides and so the approach we#xve taken here is that yes, to get people access to these drugs, but to do it within the structure of trials to make sure that we also get the evidence of what works.#xD:Matt Hancock will look at guidance around PPE in care homesMr Hancock indicated that he would look at the guidance around PPE for those working in care homes. Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt asked why the Government guidance does not require PPE to be worn in care homes for non-Covid patients andit was suggested that a risk is being taken with residents in care homes. Mr Hancock responded: #xCSo I do not think we#xre taking a risk in that way with residents in care homes.

The UK Health Secretary said: #xCI would love to be able to wave a magic wand and have PPE fall from the sky in large quantities and be able to answer your question about when shortages will be resolved. #xCBut given that we have a global situation in which there is less PPE in the world than the world needs, obviously it#xs going to be a huge pressure point.#xD He added: #xCThere#xs nothing that I can say at this select committee that will take away the fact that we have a global challenge and we#xre doing everything we can to resolve it to get that PPE to the front line.#xD :UK Health Secretary admits country is tight on gownsMatt Hancock has admitted the UK is #xCtight on gowns#xD but that , more are due to arrive today. Asked whether reports that some NHS trusts do not have enough gowns to get them through the weekend, Mr Hancock said: #xCAs of this weekend we will have shipped  billion items of personal protective equipment across the UK - so this is a... I#xve called it a Herculean effort before, it is a massive undertaking.#xCAnd it is understanding in a massive undertaking like that that there are complications and that there are challenges and I take responsibility for getting PPE out to everyone.#xD He added: #xCWe are tight on gowns, that is the pressure point at the moment. We have another , gowns arriving today and we#xre working on the acquisition internationally of more gowns, but it is a challenge. #xCAnd this follows changing the guidance  days ago which increased the advice on the use of gowns but also said that they should be used for sessional use rather than for inidual patient use. #xCAnd it is a big challenge delivering against that new guidance and we#xre doing everything we possibly can.#xD :Couples are likely to delay marriage, report saysCouples are likely to delay getting married in the wake of coronavirus, as by the time social distancing rules are lted it might be too late in the year for many weddings to happen, according to a report. Law firm Boodle Hatfield said couples were already deciding to marry later in le as more women were waiting until they were well established in their careers. The delay has led to the average age gap between men and women at marriage narrowing to . years, down from . years in , it was suggested. Emily Brand, a partner at Boodle Hatfield, said: #xCIt wouldn#xt be surprising to see a lot of couples delay marriages in the wake of coronavirus. Gearing up for a wedding can be an enormous undertaking requiring months of planning. #xCBy the time social distancing rules are lted, we might be too late in the year for many weddings to happen. #xCAdd in the financial burden caused by furloughs and job losses, and a lot of people might decide getting married in  is a better option.#xD:Number of NHS staff whove come forward to be tested is lower than expectedMr Hancock said that the number of NHS staff who have come forward to be tested for the virus has been lower than expected. He said: #xCWithin the NHS, the number of staff coming forward for testing is lower than was anticipated. #xCYou#xll understand why we had a priority order for the use of the test where it was patients first, then NHS staff. #xCFrankly, the number of NHS staff coming forward wasn#xt as high as expected and therefore we extended it very quickly both to residents and staff in social care. #xCBut because capacity is going up sharply, I#xm therefore able to expand it further and we#xll expand it again as soon as the capacity is there to make sure that that capacity is used up.#xD:Primark donates , items to Nightingale hospitalPrimark is donating thousands of products to London#xs new NHS Nightingale Hospital to help the nation fight the le-threatening coronavirus.Care packs containing around , items are being donated to the hospital, as numbers continue to rise in the UK.The donation is in response to calls for essential items from the NHS and is being accompanied by similar initiatives in other countries where Primark trades such as Ireland, Italy, Spain and the US.The packs contain underwear, leggings, T-shirts, footwear and towels and will be used by medical staff who are frequently working back-to-back shts or away from home, as well as patients who need a change of clothes or toiletries.Click here toon this. :There is capacity for , more tests, Matt Hancock saysMr Hancock said there is currently capacity for , more tests to be carried out. #xCWe have capacity for , more tests a day than we did yesterday which I find, given the pressures on testing, is frustrating,#xD he said. Asked by Science and Technology Committee chairman Greg Clark whether asymptomatic health workers should be routinely tested, Mr Hancock said: #xCThis is something that we are looking at. #xCThe asymptomatic transmission of Covid- is one of the novel features of it, it is not typical amongst coronaviruses and is one of the single most dficult things that has caused this pandemic to be so severe across the world. #xCThe answer to your question very precisely is yes that is something that we#xre looking at and I#xm talking to hospital chief executives about.#xD He said he could give a response with actions #xCin the coming weeks#xD.:UK government will build up contact tracing teamsMr Hancock said the Government would be building up contact tracing teams as part of the #xCtest, track and trace#xD strategy. He told the committee: #xCThat brings together teams from NHSX, who are leading on the app, with a huge array of partners that are working within that, from Public Health England, who are the experts on what we refer to as external contact tracing. #xCThe app is itself a contact tracing app, that is the point of it, is to be able to assist iniduals to do contact tracing themselves by notying people who they have been in close contact with when they have downloaded the app. #xCAnd then of course link that to testing, so people can get the tests.#xD :Swiss government plans gradual easing of restrictions from April The Swiss death toll from coronavirus has reached , people, the country#xs public health agency said on Friday, rising from , on Thursday. The number of people showing positive tests for COVID- increased to , from ,, it said.The government plans gradual easing of restrictions to curb the epidemic#xs spread from April , starting with the opening of hairdressers and nail bars.:Matt Hancock describes the expansion to testingMatt Hancock said: #xCNow we#xve got the curve under control, I want to be able to get back to the position that we can test everybody with symptoms and I anticipate being able to do that relatively soon because we#xre increasing capacity as I say. #xCI can now give you the full figures for yesterday - at midday yesterday, we#xd done , tests in the previous  hours, , from pillar one, , from pillar two, and  from pillar four. #xCSo I know history of testing is going to be a long debated subject. What really matters is what we#xre going to do from here on in. #xCAnd what I can tell you is that today we are able to expand the eligibility for testing which is currently for patients, for surveys and for NHS and social care staff, and some that go to LRFs for local urgent need. #xCI can today expand the eligibility for testing to police, the fire service, prison staff, critical local authority staff, the judiciary and DWP staff who need it and we#xre able to do that because of the scale-up of testing.#xDClick here to read our developing story.:Government had considered London-specic lockdown before nationwide measuresMr Hancock told the committee that the Government had considered a #xCLondon-specic lockdown#xD before implementing the measures nationwide. #xCWe did consider having a London-specic lockdown, and decided that it was better to do it across the country as a whole,#xD the Health Secretary said. #xCAnd that#xs for two reasons. The first is thatyou put a lockdown in one part of the country, then there#xs still travel from there to the rest of the country, so it isn#xt as easy as that. #xCAnd the second reason is that actually one of the really strong things that#xs come through this crisis is that the country is acting in lockstep.#xD He said that the country had #xCcome together#xD in response to the social distancing measures. #xCTo separate off one part of the country from the rest actually has downsides in terms of the national unity that we#xve seen in support for the overall response,#xD he added.:KEY EVENTTesting expanded to police, fire and prison servicesMatt Hancock says the eligibility for testing will be expanded to police, fire and prison services, critical local authority workers, the judiciary and DWP staff who need it.He said he had also expanded testing to social care staff and more residents in social care. He said mass community testing is part of the government strategy and they will introduce it when they can. :Lag in publication of overall death toll due to data collection issueMr Hancock said that the reason for there being a lag in the ONS publication of overall death numbers is due to a data collection issue. Asked by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt why only hospital deaths are being reported on a daily basis, he said: #xCSo the overall goal here is to be as transparent as possible and the quality of the data is the critical part to this question. #xCSo we have daily reports of deaths from Covid- or people with Covid-, whether it#xs deemed by the clinicians as the direct cause of somebody dying with Covid-. #xCWe have that in daily reports that come in through the four NHSs in the four nations and come into a central point and are then published.#xCThe data of deaths of people who have Covid- and die outside of hospitals takes longer to collect and that#xs because it is recorded on death certicates and death certicates are often written a couple of days after a death, they#xre not always written at the same time as the death, and then they#xre registered and go into the registry and then the data can be published. #xCSo the reason that the ONS publishes with a lag the overall number of deaths, as opposed to deaths in hospital, it is a data collection issue.#xD :Irans coronavirus death toll rises by  to ,Iran#xs death toll from coronavirus rose by  in the past  hours to reach , on Friday, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on state TV.

Iran is the Middle Eastern country worst-affected by COVID- and has one of the world#xs highest death tolls.:The number of Covid- deaths in care homes is higher than reportedMr Hancock said that he has a #xChigh degree of confidence#xD that the number and proportion of Covid- deaths in care homes is higher than reported. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said: #xCYou talked about the ONS, they say that there have been  Covid deaths in care homes to date. #xCNow, Scotland thinks a quarter of its Covid deaths are in care homes, France, Italy, Spain think it#xs about half their Covid deaths in care homes. #xCDoes it really seem likely to you that less than % of our Covid deaths are in care homes #xD Mr Hancock responded: #xCNo, and the figure that you mention is a figure from a couple of weeks back and so I#xm absolutely sure that both the number and the proportion are... I can say with a high degree of confidence that the number and the proportion are higher than that you say and I#xll wait for the official statistics to understand it.#xD Matt Hancock being questioned by MPs :Inside the high speed trains transferring critically ill coronavirus patientsA high speed train has been used to ferry critically ill patients across France to free up intensive care beds.As the country continues to treat tens of thousands of Covid- patients, French medical authorities have commandeered TGV trains to transport the critically ill to less busy hospitals.The rail network is best known for the incredibly high speeds its trains hit as they surge through the French countryside.On Friday, April  the drivers were ordered to keep to a slower pace when  coronavirus patients were loaded on board.Instead of the usual bustling stations at Paris#x Austerlitz station, the two trains were met by a long line of ambulances, stretchers and medical staff.The full article is here.

Pushed on whether he has an estimate for the number of health workers who have been infected, he added: #xCNo I don#xt. What I have is an estimate of the proportion who are off work because they either have suspected Covid- or a household member does, which is a little over %. #xCAnd obviously with the expansion of testing we hope to be able to get that figure down.#xD Asked whether the Government will be changing its advice for pregnant healthcare workers in light of the death of Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, Mr Hancock said: #xCThe first thing is to say that we work very closely with the Royal Colleges and whether guidance comes from the Royal Colleges, Public Health England or the NHS, we try to ensure that guidance comes from the most appropriate body for that particular group and we work very closely together.#xD:The Government’s six-element “battle plan” in combating spread of the virusGiving his evidence to the Health and Social Care Committee this morning, Matt Hancock outlined the Government#xs six-element #xCbattle plan#xD in combating the spread of the virus. He described the first, social distancing measures, as #xCmission critical#xD, alongside the second part of the plan of building up NHS capacity. #xCAs of this morning, we have the highest figure again of spare UK-wide critical care beds, of ,,#xD he said. #xCAnd of course the NHS Nightingale project, which has seen unbelievable roll-out, is a critical part of making sure we have always got NHS capacity.#xD Mr Hancock said the third part was supply of equipment, fourth part supply of testing and the fth part on treatments and vaccines. On the fth part, he told the committee: #xCThe more that we can do on treatments the less dangerous the disease is, and obviously on vaccines the UK is playing a world-leading role, but there is certainly still some time to go. #xCThe reason is because the mortality and morbidity is relatively low from this disease, terrible as the death toll is, the relative proportion of people who sadly die is relatively low.#xD After outlining the sixth path, which is shielding, Mr Hancock said: #xCOverall the goal is to bend the curve down and make sure the NHS capacity is there. #xCAnd at the same time to do the work to try to improve the ability of us as a society to cope with this disease and therefore with the goal that we can lt some of the incredibly restrictive measures we have to place on the population in order to get the disease under control.#xD :UK scientists believe Covid- outbreak may have started in SeptemberResearchers from the University of Cambridge have investigated the virus#x origin to calculate the likely date of the initial outbreak.Their findings indicate that the outbreak in Wuhan occurred between September  and December .Peter Forster, who led the study, said: #xCThe virus may have mutated into its final #xhuman-efficient#x form months ago, but stayed inside a bat or other animal or even human for several months without infecting other iniduals.#xCThen, it started infecting and spreading among humans between September  and December .#xDClick here for the full story.:KEY EVENTGovernment commits to publishing NHS staff death toll  times a weekHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the official figure of NHS staff who have died from Coronavirus remains at .But he admitted the figure does not include Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, who died on Sunday.Mr Hancock said: #xCThe official veried figure remains , it gets updated  times a week and I will let you know as soon as I get an update.#xCSadly we#xve all seen reports of Mary the nurse who was pregnant and in the late stage of pregnancy, an NHS nurse, and died since the publication of the previous figures.

It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock prepares to face questions from MPs on Friday over the Governmentaposs coronavirus response, a day after lockdown measures were extended for at least another three weeks. Mr Hancock is expected to be quizzed on personal protective equipmentand an exit strategy as he appears before a virtual session of the Commons Health Committee. Meanwhile, the body which represents NHS biomedical scientists has said its members are still being held back from ramping up Covid- testing by a lack of kits, not a lack of capacity. The Institute of Biomedical Sciencesaid NHS labs were still struggling to source kits and reagents, and cast doubt on the ability to reach Mr Hancockaposs end-of-the-month target of , tests a day. The body also warned new mega-labs set up by the Government may end up competing with established NHS labs. Downing Street said on Thursday the UK now has the capacity to conduct , coronavirus tests a day - although fewer than half that number are currently being carried out. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said that in the  hours up to am on Wednesday, , tests were carried out across England, Scotland and Wales. Total testing capacity includes , in public facilities and a further , through commercial testing facilities. We have been very clear that where there is spare capacity available that should be used on NHS staff, on their families, and in social care, the spokesman said. IBMS president Allan Wilson said the issue within NHS labs was not capacity, but a lack of kits. The , NHS laboratory workers that I represent are increasingly expressing their frustration, he said in a statement. They have applied themselves innovatively to increase Covid- testing capacity and have the s ready so that the NHS laboratories are able to meet the Secretary of Stateaposs ambitious target, but they are still not able to source the testing kits and reagents they require. It concerns me when I see signicant investments being made in mass testing centres that are planning to conduct , of the , tests a day. These facilities would be a welcome resource and take pressure off the NHSthe issue around testing was one of capacity. However, we are clear that it is a global supply shortage holding biomedical scientists back, not a lack of capacity.

Jamie Sparrow has appeared in court for breaching lockdown guidance after inviting a number of people to enjoy a barbecue and drink alcohol at his home in Kearsley, Bolton. Police were called to the house yesterday after a nurse who lived on the street reported the party, Manchester Evening News reports. A disturbance then broke out in the street after Sparrowaposs next-door neighbour Helen Bent directed a torrent of abuse at the woman who had complained.Bent, , and Sparrow, , were arrested and spent a night in the cells before appearing at Manchester Magistratesapos Court today.A judge was told police had been called to the party at the semi-detached property during the day. Despite a warning, the party continued late into the evening. When officers ed at pm, they found six people still inside the house - including a young child. Bent defied further orders to leave and, as other neighbours aired their concerns to officers in the street, the mother-of-three turned on the woman who had complained, calling her a aposfat f***ing s**gapos. She then stormed back inside the house and turned up the volume on the music while shouting apospartyapos.  Laura Keegan, prosecuting, said Sparrow, who works as a care worker at a childrenaposs home, then started behaving in an aposaggressive and argumentativeapos manner towards officers, who were forced to restrain him. The court heard the father-of-one did not aposseem to understand what social distancing isapos even when officers tried to explain it to him. Ms Keegan added: He told police he would do whatever he wants, when he wants. He said he was allowed to have a house party. Joseph Foxler, representing the pair in court, said Sparrow had consumed two glasses of rum, but was not a regular drinker. Bent had drunk eight cans of Carling in the build-up to the incident, but was said not to be drunk. The pair pleaded guilty to charges of a breach of peace and contravening a requirement as to restriction of movement.

Leaders from the industry said they were receiving only “paltry” and “haphazard” deliveries of lesaving items such as masks, gloves and gowns. It added that carers have been forced to go without such items while they have been mandatory for all healthcare workers. Meanwhile, NHS staff have taken part in protests to highlight the failings in PPE provision and are calling on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to resign.  They launched a protest on social media yesterday, backed by campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, to coincide with the pm Clap for our Carers. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror Their campaign states: “As we see our colleagues die, we have lost confidence in the Government.” Mark Boothroyd, , an AE nurse at London’s St Thomas’s Hospital, where Boris Johnson was treated, said: “We’re all fed up with not having enough PPE or not good enough quality PPE, it’s putting us at risk. We feel we’re being lied to.  “The government is trying to blame us for their failings and it’s our safety - and our lives - on the line. “We’re seeing the government telling everyone it’s fine and it’s going to be ok - it is not. We know it’s not. “St Thomas’s is one of the best hospitals in the country and we only have enough high quality PPE for our ICUs and Resus - and we’re just about scraping by on the wards. “We don’t have enough gowns for doing personal care with patients. In the community the situation is even more dire and they are really struggling.” The explosive letter was sent to the Government by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and leaked to the BBC. It adds: “Testing for care workers appears to be being rolled out without being given thought to who is going to be tested and what we are going to do with the result.” It said the care sector, which looks after around , of Britain’s most vulnerable people, was being overlooked while officials focused on the NHS.  The letter said staff had been left confused and faced extra work because of mixed messages put out by officials. It also criticised the Government for recruiting , NHS volunteers and then giving them “nothing to do”. Care bosses believe these people were erted from volunteering with the elderly in their local communities. Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall said: “The concerns raised in this letter are extremely worrying. Their view that the supply chain for PPE has been shambolic and that testing for care workers hasn’t been properly thought through must be an urgent wake-up call for ministers. “ Coronavirus has exposed the already fragile state of these vital services. Ministers must heed the warnings from Adass and take all necessary action to halt the emerging crisis in social care.” Facing growing pressure to act, Mr Hancock on Wednesday promised measures to alleviate the dire situation in the nation’s , care homes.  He vowed to raise the amount of personal protective kit given to homes and to offer testing to all residents and staff with symptoms. Mr Hancock yesterday said he was confident only % homes – or one in six – had outbreaks. However, robust data from across Europe showed around half of care homes have Covid- cases. Care providers estimate up to two thirds of English care homes have outbreaks. Adass said it was “disappointed” that the letter was leaked publicly, but said the issues addressed “were already in the public domain and a cause of considerable concern”. President Julie Ogley said: “Some of the language used in the letter  may be more emotional than we would normally use, but we are in emotional times.  “We see continuing concerns about access to PPE, availability of testing, rising numbers of Covid-  cases  in care homes and people are sadly dying. “It is vital we prioritise people who are using social care, family carers and staff, whether in care homes or their own homes, to protect them.

He was, however, no priest but undercover police detective Leo­­nard “Nipper” Read about to finally take down the most feared gang in London’s history. While pretending to hear the con­­­fessions of a sinner, he instead took a secret statement from the Kray twins’ trusted right-hand man that would put them behind bars for the rest of their lives.  Nipper, widely regarded as the greatest policeman of post-war Britain, died last week at  – another victim of coronavirus.Author James Morton, who wrote Nipper Read: The Man Who Nicked the Krays with the legendary detective, says his friend had “a good and remarkable le”. “He did what no one  man­­aged – to put the Krays behind bars. He was honest and trustworthy at a time when a great many in the Met were not so honest. He was a thoroughly genuine, decent man. As a crime author, I’ve spoken to a lot of criminals who knew and respected him. “The we of one robber he helped convict told me he was the perfect gentleman in every way.”  Nipper shouldn’t actually have been allowed to join the police at all. Too small at ft in – hence his nickname – he failed the entrance criteria for the force in his home city of Nottingham. He was only accepted by the Met after convincing the medical examiner he was still growing, at the age of , and promising to perform daily “stretching” exercises. But his short stature proved invaluable. He admitted: “I was very small and very thin and didn’t look anything like a policeman”.  It came in useful many times as he went under cover and he was soon sent to CID. Early attempts to put Ronnie and Reggie behind bars ended in disaster as their violent reputation made witnesses afraid to testy. So Nipper’s new boss, Assistant Commissioner Peter Brodie, tasked him with bringing down the organised crime bosses once and for all. Nipper later remembered being astonished at the celebrity status of the Krays in London’s East End.  He said: “If they drove down Commercial Road every­­one waved. “If somebody had a drink with them, it was like having tea with Princess Margaret.” As an undercover officer, he first saw Ronnie Kray in  at the Grave Maurice pub in Whitechapel. He said: “There was a big American car and a guy stepped out with his hand in his pocket as though he had a gun there and sort of swept the street, making sure there was no one in sight. He gave a signal, the door opened and out stepped Ronnie.  “He was dressed like a s Chicago gangster with a cashmere coat that reached to his ankles tied with a loose belt at the waist. His hair was greased and parted and he wore glasses. “He looked like Al Capone without his fedora.” Convinced they were untouchable, the Krays’ gang The Firm were responsible for a string of gruesome murders in  and . In the first, Ronnie shot George Cornell in the head in front of locals in the Blind Beggar pub because he had referred to him as “a fat poof”. Another victim, Jack “the Hat” McVitie, was lured to a basement where he was held down in a chair as Reggie sliced his face with broken glass before stabbing him with a carving kne in the face and neck and twisting the kne. Nipper knew that,he wanted to catch the biggest fish of all, he would have to do things dferently, explains Mr Morton.  He says: “The Krays were getting away with it because their solicitor’s clerk knew certain people in the Met who they were paying off. “The story was thatyou went in to make a statement about the Krays, by the time you came out the brothers already had a copy.” Nipper began approaching fringe members of The Firm, persuading them to spill the beans in exchange for immunity. Knowing there were few officers he could trust, he revealed as little of his investigations as possible. Even so, the Krays got wind he was after them. They bought two boa constrictors and named them Read and Gerrard after Nipper and his partner Fred Gerrard.Eventually Nipper had enough to charge the Krays with fraudand grievous bodily harm and, in May , the twins, along with brother Charlie and their lieutenant Albert Donoghue, were dragged from their beds and arrested in a dawn raid. With the ringleaders behind bars, Nipper set to work persuading key witnesses, include the barmaid of the pub where George Cornell was shot dead and Leslie Payne, who had handled the Kray’s business affairs, to testy against them. Mr Morton says: “The barmaid was terried. So he played a long and patient game, taking her and her children to Lon­­­don airport to see the planes and slowly persuading her she did not need to be afraid.” But at Brix­­­ton prison, the Krays were planning to pin the mur­­ders on other gang members, inc­­luding Donoghue. But he got wind of it and sent a message, via his mother, that he wanted to speak to Nipper.  This was when the detective dressed as a vicar and met Donoghue in the jail chapel. Mr Morton says: “Donoghue said ‘I’ll tell you everything’. And he did. That was the moment the Krays’ empire came crashing down.” The following year the twins were sen­­tenced to le with a mini­­mum  years – the longest murder sen­­tences ever handed down at the Old Bailey. Ronnie died aged  in Broadmoor in  and Reggie in , eight weeks after being released on compassionate grounds. Nipper retired in , having received the Queen’s Police Medal the previous year, and became national security adviser to the National Museums and Galleries Commission.

He was desperate as he watched his sobbing daughters say their final goodbyes to their mum who only had two hours to live, and asked the doctorhe he had heard of anything weird and wacky, any experimental treatment or something being used abroad in a desperate plea that I knew he couldn’t answer. However, the doctor did know of something - and it was a technique which has been used in ICUaposs for years, but not without risks in Staceyaposs case. Adam, a former news editor with the Times and now a PR consultant, wrote in his former paper how his two daughters, aged  and , had read Motheraposs Day cards to their dying mum on Sunday, March , hoping to say everything they wanted to say before their mum passed away. Adam later told Sky News this was heartbreaking. Mum-of-two Stacey was unconscious and on a le-support machine, in the intensive care unit of the Whipps Cross Hospital in East London, after her condition deteriorated two after having been admitted to hospital on March . Stacey, who has type  diabetes, was dying from the coronavirus and bacterial pneumonia while Adam said her kidneys and heart were not working properly. Adam and his two sobbing daughters donned full personal protective equipment including gloves, aprons and facemasks having been called to the hospital - which was on lockdown - to say their goodbyes. Adam told Sky News the PPE was so claustrophobic and he doesnapost know how the NHS hero medics wear it hour after hour. Writing in the Times, Adam said: A doctor had called and asked how quickly I could get to the hospital. When I arrived, he told me there was very little they could do for her and we should say goodbye. I remember askingthere was aposanything weird or wackyapos he had heard about, anything experimental that was working abroad. It was a desperate plea that I knew he couldn’t answer.  It was then that the doctor, who Adam said was called Dave, told him about proning, but warned it could place such pressure on her heart - that it could cause a fatal heart attack. Adam told BBC Radio aposs The World At One programme: Heexplained what proning was, where you turn the patient onto their stomach for about twelve, fteen hours and it promotes... it should promote oxygen flow, blood flow and improve the lungs. But he warned, because Staceyaposs heart wasnapost working properly and her heart and her kidneys, it would probably kill her - the pressure on her heart would be fatal. But I remember saying to him, look, well sheaposs going to die anyway and he said yes - so the three of us decided that there was nothing really to lose. We had to give it a shot. Adam told Sky News he discussed the risk with his two daughters and came to the only conclusion that there was nothing left to lose.  He said: Doctor Dave said stay, becauseanything goes wrong, it will go wrong really quickly. He came back after an hour and said she was still fighting, still surviving, go home and weaposll ring youanything bad happens. And that night the phone didnapost ring. They turned her again the next day for about  hours and the phone didnapost ring Monday night.

However, he appeared to downplay any link to the ongoing pandemic at the time, making no reference to it at a groundbreaking ceremony and instead linking its completion to a national holiday. But now it looks like the project might be rushed to completion even sooner.Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirrorAccording to state run media, builders are intent on completing construction “faster and better”, and are working “day and night” to get the hospital up and running. The report added that the “vicious” sanctions imposed by “hostile forces” to punish North Korea for its nuclear weapons programme were having no impact on progress. New images show that foundations had already been dug, concrete poured and metal structural supports installed.  In one photo construction can be seen continuing at night. The reason for the renewed urgency is not stated in the report, but experts agree that the building is coming together quickly. Martyn Williams and Peter Makoswky from North Korea watchdog,  North, analysed the project in satellite photos.  “Construction has continued at such pace that for the first time – after just under one month – the overall outline of the building is visible,” they wrote. “Commercial satellite imagery from April  shows clear outlines of the two towers that will dominate the rear of the hospital. “The rest of the building is also taking shape, including a distinctive lip that juts out from the front of the hospital.”  North Korea’s two closest neighbours have had tens of thousands of coronavirus cases, but the Kim regime says there has not been a single one within its borders. The claim cannot be independently veried in the closed-off country and has been met with scepticism.

Doctors warned Talia and Oliver they could lose both twins - however they were allowed to take the boys home after four and a half months in hospital. While both twins suffered from lung disease, in November last year Ashley was then diagnosed with incurable pulmonary hypertension.Doctors told Talia and Oliver the complication could lead to heart failure and was placed on a ventilator. In January, the heartbroken parents were then told their son would never be able to breathe alone and the agonising decision to turn off his le support was made.

We asked two top experts for their insights into the way back to normality... How do we know when we have reached the peak  Prof Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “First, we are still testing many fewer people than in our European neighbours. Second, it seems to be very dficult to get timely data on deaths. “Once we have good quality data, we can ask whether the reproduction number – or R – has fallen below . If it has, we will know that every person who is infected is passing the infection on to fewer than one other person, which is absolutely crucial.” Dr John Ashton, former regional director of public health for the North West, believes we may actually still be some way off reaching the peak of the epidemic. He said: “All this talk about reaching the peak is based on the number of admissions and the number of deaths in hospitals, which seems to have levelled off, particularly in London. But that may be because fewer people are now being referred to hospitals as GPs are using clinical protocols to decide who will benefit from hospital treatment and who is too frail to be sent to hospital, and a lot of people are dying at home. In care homes too, we know there are a lot of deaths but we don’t know how many. How many days beyond the peak will lockdown start to be lted  Around two weeks after the reproduction number has fallen below , according to Prof McKee. But he cautioned: “Only when we are confident about the accuracy of the data can we begin thinking about loosening the lockdown. Also, this is absolutely dependent on having a robust system for testing and contact tracing in place.” How might the Government go about lting restrictions  Prof McKee said: “Firstly, we can ease the restrictions very gradually, for example, open only certain types of shops. The second thing is to put in place mechanisms to reduce spread, which will certainly include continued physical distancing.” Dr Ashton believes measures could first be eased off in parts of the country which have registered fewer cases. He said: “There don’t seem to be a lot of deaths in South West England, East Anglia and Lincolnshire and the main parts of Wales. “We could begin to relax restrictions in those places and adopt the same approach as we started with, testing, contract tracing and isolating those who test positive.”  But, again, he warned easing lockdown will only worktesting is massively ramped up. Could the schools be reopened soon  Denmark has relaxed restrictions on eduction, with children up to the age of  ing to nurseries and schools this week. But Dr Ashton is not convinced. He said: “Schoolkids are good at spreading viruses, so I don’t understand the talk about reopening schools.” Could younger workers who live alone be first back to work  Dr Ashton believes “creative solutions” must be found. He said: “I’ve been arguing that we should be billeting essential workers and volunteers away from anyone who is susceptible to the virus, and that might mean taking over hotels and boarding houses to allow them to live a normal le.”  Prof McKee, however, is sceptical of allowing some under a certain age toto work and prohibiting others. Which shops might be allowed to open first  Dr Ashton says: “If you want to stop people mixing then you don’t want places where people are sitting next to each other. However, you might want to open drinks and food retailers offering only takeaway or carry home services, but I still think that’s still some way off.” Could office and factory workers be tested before work  Prof McKee said: “The logistical challenges would be enormous, not least because it does take time to do the tests.”  Dr Ashton believes that regular testing such workers will be crucial. He says: “One option might be to test them all before they are allowed back, then screen their temperatures several times a day.” Aren’t other countries beginning toto normal  Prof McKee points out Spain is only moving to a position which is still more restrictive than in the UK. He adds: “In Italy, only a few shops, such as bookshops and those selling children’s clothing are being allowed to open in some regions.” Once the measures are lted, might they have to be reinstated   “Yes,” says Prof McKee. “Restrictions cannot be considered permanent until we have actually got this virus under control.” When will I be able to see my elderly relatives in a care home or self-isolating at home  Dr Ashton says: “It will be a long time before you will be able to see your relatives face to face, until we’re absolutely clear what’s going on. People will have to find ways to care for and love their relatives without being there in person, and make sure they can speak to them via videoconferencing.”  Prof McKee agrees, but warns: “We need to think very carefully about how we support those people who are confined.” Until a vaccine is developed, how might le remain dferent  Prof McKee said: “I think people will be very cautious about ing to anything like normality. This will have huge implications for how we live our lives, including the places we meet and shop, and for leisure, in particular where we go on holiday.” Dr Ashton says he doubts any of us will be able to go abroad for our summer holidays.

The droplets behave like an aerosol - a suspension of particles or droplets in air or another gas - and can penetrate deep into the lungs when they are breathed in, scientists found. A team from the US National Institutes of Health used a laser light-scattering experiment to demonstrate how droplets fill the air when a person speaks, and how masks can block them and prevent the spread of Covid-. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror.  The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Molecular biologist Dr Matthew Meselson, of Hard University, wrote: Certain persons called apossuper spreadersapos produce many more aerosol particles than other persons. These particles are too small to settle because of gravity, but they are carried by air currents and dispersed by dfusion and air turbulence. Inhaled aerosolised particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and infect cells in the alveoli, air sacs in the lungs which exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules to and from the bloodstream, the study found. The particles can be carried by drafts. Dr Meselson added: Aerosols from infected persons may therefore pose an inhalation threat even at considerable distances and in enclosed spaces, particularlythere is poor ventilation. The possible contribution of infective aerosols to the current pandemic suggests the advisability of wearing a suitable mask whenever it is thought that infected persons may be nearby and of providing adequate ventilation of enclosed spaces where such persons are known to be or may recently have been. The researchers said some studies have shown that the number of droplets produced by speaking is similar to the number produced by coughing.Masks can prevent the droplets from filling the air, the scientists said. A separate study in the New England Journal of Medicine in March found that aerosolised coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.

Now, a typical burger consists of a beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese and onion - and whatever sauce tickles your fancy, letaposs say tomato ketchup and mustard for argumentaposs sake. You only have to take one bite for most of the filling to fall out and the sauce to be dripping half way down your chin - not ideal. But, it doesnapost have to be that way anymore. A group of researchers who specialise in fluid mechanics, engineering, and dentistry have claimed that in fact, there is a right way and a wrong way to hold and eat a massive burger without it falling to pieces.  They demonstrated their elaborate findings after four months of research on the Japanese television showHonma Dekka! .The episode isnapost new, itaposs actually from , but has resurfaced and been doing the rounds on social media once again during lockdown. On the show, a scan of the burger shows how each of the filling elements interact with each other. Then it shows how a person usually holds a burger, with their thumbs on the bottom bun and the rest of their fingers supporting the top bun.  What this does is squeeze all of the fillings out of the sides of the bun. The researchers then tried holding a burger in numerous ways, to see which way resulted in the least amount of spillage. Hereaposs what they concluded. How it should be done, according to the experts When you pick up your burger, you must make sure that youaposre not holding it too tight - this is vital. Subconsciously we do this when we take a bite, perhaps in the hopes that the harder we squeeze it, the higher the chances weaposve got in keeping it together. But all this does is crushes your burger, and forces the fillings to spill out.  Before you take your very first bite, the dentist explains that you should try opening your mouth wide and closing it again to warm up the muscles. And, the best way to hold it is to put your thumbs and pinkie fingers at the bottom, and your other three fingers on top in a claw like position. Your pinkies will affectively hold the back portion of the bun together so the contents wonapost fall out.

Fatemeh Khishvand, who became an Instagram star due to her alleged transformation, is said to be on a ventilator and fighting for her le at Sina Hospital in Tehran. The -year-old was detained in October last year amid a crackdown on Instagram celebrities, and faces charges including corruption on earth, encouraging youth to engage in lunacy, insulting the sacred” and “acquiring illicit income”, said activists calling for her release. Lawyers for Ms Khishvand, known on Instagram as Sahar Tabar, had begged a judge to free her due to Iranaposs coronavirus outbreak - the worst in the Middle East - but she was refused bail even though other prisoners have been released following similar concerns. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. Lawyer Payam Derafshan told the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran : “We find it unacceptable that this young woman has now caught the coronavirus in these circumstances while her detention order has been extended during all this time in jail. Ms Khishvand faces years in prison for engaging in peaceful freedom of expression on her personal Instagram account, the CHRI added. Iran has suffered one of the worst outbreaks with almost , cases and , deaths reported by Tehran and the country has been accused of grossly under reporting cases and deaths. A parliamentary report said the actual number might be almost twice as many and warned that up to  per cent of the Iranian population could test positive for Coovid-isolation measures are not implemented.  In a worst-case scenario, as many as , could diejust  per cent of containment measures are in place, the report added. Ms Khishvand became an Instagram star in  when she posted photos of her transformation. She claimed she had undergone  surgeries to look like Oscar-winning actress Ms Jolie, . But Instagram users dubbed her a zombie due to her hollow cheeks, upturned nose and gaunt appearance. But she later admitted she had achieved the look through the use of make-up and digital editing, and shared photos of her actual appearance. Her lawyer, Mr Derafshan, said Judge Mohammad Moghiseh repeatedly denied to release her on bail as the coronavirus outbreak worsened, and the judge is now unreachable. Mr Derafshan added: “It’s not the prison director’s fault that she’s behind bars. The responsibility rests with Mr Moghiseh.” Jail officials denied that she had caught the disease.  But Mr Derafshan said: “It seems like it has become a habit for the authorities to deny everything. “It makes no sense to deny this. The prison director should acknowledge the infection and admit she has been hospitalised.” He has called on Tehran to release Ms Khishvand and other prisoners who were detained on allegations of committing non-violent crimes.  He added: “Many women in Shahr-e Rey Prison have contacted my colleague and me about the terrible situation inside the prison and the fear that exists among the inmates [due to the coronavirus]. “We want the authorities to issue a general order to allow these prisoners to be temporarily released. In the absence of judges who are sick or not coming to work, this is the only solution.” The Iran Human Rights Monitor has described Shahre-rey, the prison where Ms Khishvand was detained, as the most dangerous and worst prison for women in the country due to its inhumane medical and psychological conditions.

It said the prison, also known as Qarchak, is located on a former industrial chicken farm in a desert east of Tehran, and falls far below the UNaposs rules for the treatment of prisoners. Inmates have complained of disgusting conditions such as contagious diseases, urine-stained floors, insufficient and filthy toilets, contaminated food, foul odours and a lack of ventilation. It can hold about , prisoners. Last month, Iran temporarily released , prisoners as it struggled to contain the new strain of coronavirus.  British-Iranian mum Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe, , was among them. Her leave from Evin prison in Tehran was extended to Saturday as the Iranian Prosecutor General considers her plea for clemency. Ms Zaghari-Ratclfe, whose five-year-old daughter Gabriella has ed to London to be with dad Richard Ratclfe, has been staying at her parentsapos home in Iranaposscapital. She was ordered to wear an ankle tag and cannot go far from her parentsapos home.  In its most recent update, the Free Nazanin campaign said there was still no update on her appeal clemency. Her father was told to check in again on Saturday to find out whether her furlough would be extended again. One of her former cellmates was on a list of approved clemencies earlier this month. Iran, meanwhile, paraded disinfection vehicles, mobile hospitals and other medical equipment as it marked its national Army Day on Friday to underscore the militaryaposs role in battling the coronavirus pandemic which has hit the country hard.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This was a highly unusual end to the season, to say the least, and not the one any of us would have preferred, but all three deserve enormous credit for their performances over the course of the season.“With the turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Covid- outbreak, there was always going to be a highly-charged and passionate debate about how we secure the future of Scottish football.“It is no exaggeration to say that this was an existential matter for Scottish clubs, with many of them telling us they were at real risk of going under unless the situation was resolved very quickly, so I’m pleased that the game has moved decisively.“Whilst more than % of clubs agreed with the directors’ written resolution, it’s clear that others were strongly opposed.“There has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward and I now call on all  clubs to move forward in a constructive and positive way.”SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster also had his say on tonight’s development.He said: “Prior to this positive result, we were unable to make the vital end-of-season payments, which will provide a leline to so many clubs in the lower isions. From our detailed discussions with clubs, many were facing an enormous cash-flow crisis. We have moved as quickly as possible to try to resolve this unprecedented situation.“We’ve achieved the % agreement threshold in the Ladbrokes Premiership, Championship and Leagues  and  and will now be working as quickly as we can to get the end-of-season payments to members in the three lower isions by the end of this week.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

midfielder dylan mcgeouch","story":"AS MUCH as Dylan McGeouch would like to play out this season, it is a secondary thought for now for the Aberdeen midfielder.With the country in lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic the Dons ace has put thoughts of football restarting to one side.McGeouch’s greatest concern at this time is the safety of everyone across the country.Prior to last month’s shutdown the Reds had reached a Scottish Cup semi-final where they were due to face Celtic.Derek McInnes’ men were also just a point behind Motherwell in the battle to finish third in the Premiership.McGeouch would like to try to finish the campaign, but says right now it’s all about staying safe.The -year-old said: “There are a lot of questions and I think we’re keen to finish the league and Scottish Cup. Obviously we want to make sure we’re safe first and that there’s no risk taking.“Once we’re past that stage and the football is back on, that feels secondary now. It’s just about keeping people safe.”Scottish football remains in stalemate with Dundee stalling an SPFL resolution to end the Championship, League One and League Two seasons while also giving the league body’s board the power to declare the Premiership campaign over.Due to voting structure within each ision the Dens Park club hold the vote which can determine whether the motion succeeds or fails.But Dundee have dithered and other clubs are ready to continue their fight against the resolution, with the potential the row could rumble on for some time.McGeouch believes Scottish football’s administrators have an unenviable task trying to come up with a solution.The former Celtic, Hibs and Sunderland player added: “I’m just trying to keep myself fit and look after my family. As long as we are healthy, that’s the most important thing.“In the back of your head, you are obviously thinking ‘When will the season start ’ or ‘Is it over ’“But until we are at a stage when we can go out and socialise with people, the football is left to those running the game.“It’s up to them to come to a decision. No matter what the outcome is, it’s not going to please everyone.“But these are unprecedented times and it’s hard to know where things are going to go. We just need to keep fit, stay healthy and look after each other.“Then we will see where football goes in the next few weeks and months. It’s definitely not what I expected. Obviously it’s come as a huge shock to everybody.“Nobody could see it coming. It’s not good but we’re following the rules and hopefully we can keep ourselves safe, our families safe and in the next few weeks it blows over and we can get back to normality a bit.”With people only allowed out of their homes for an hour a day for exercise, restrictions have presented a challenge for professional footballers.But McGeouch says Aberdeen’s sports scientists have risen to the challenge of trying to keep players in good condition.The January signing from Sunderland said: “To be fair, the sports scientists have been great.“They’ve given us programmes to do in the morning to keep us ticking over fitness wise and they’re sending us yoga videos to do at home.“They’re just trying to mix it up. We’ve got our own equipment, balls and stuff. It’s not great but it’s the best of a bad situation to keep us ticking over.”For footballers, having to stay indoors most of the time, every day, has been something they have had to adapt to mentally.“We need to try to keep ourselves fit,” McGeouch added. “Mentally as well we need to keep ourselves fit, not sit about the house and keep ourselves active.“We’re used to that every day, really. To go to sitting about doing nothing, it’s hard.“Hopefully with the right fitness and stuff, we’ll be in good shape when the football starts back up.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs we have highlighted in the paper over the past few weeks, the response of the public in the coronavirus crisis has been superb.People generally have abided by government advice to stay at home.

The most-quoted line is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Noble said the idea behind the forthcoming book, titled Conquered by No-one, was that  modern-day Scots would write about the  signatories to the Declaration.But Mr Noble himself is writing about two iniduals ndash William Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, and Malise IV, Earl of Strathearn.Authors of other chapters include Linklater ndash former editor of The Scotsman ndash and historian Murray Pittock.Mr Noble said: ldquoWhat I see as the underlying justication of this publication is to try to raise the profile of the Declaration of Arbroath as the most signicant document in Scottish history.Mr Noble said the -year-old document introduced the concept of government by consent to Scotland.ldquoI think thatrsquos the critical thing and why itrsquos the most important document in Scottish history, said Mr Noble.ldquoItrsquos recognised by the United States Senate as a contributing factor in the discussions that took place before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in  and itrsquos something that has had a status in the English-speaking world for quite a long time, but lost its traction in Scotland.Mr Noble said a recent survey of Scots found that around a third did not know much about the Declaration.The same poll revealed that many supporters of Scottish independence viewed the Battle of Bannockburn as more important, said Mr Noble.Asked for his own thoughts on Scottish independence, Mr Noble noted that he has lived in England for many years so would not be allowed to participate.Buthe were permitted, he would choose to remain in the United Kingdom, he said, albeit with the hope that a federal system would eventually emerge.Mr Noble said: ldquoI donrsquot think Scotland is going to stay as it is ndash I think decisions in the main should be made in Edinburgh but I believe in shared sovereignty and I think therersquos a value in being part of the UK.He added: ldquoIrsquom not yet persuaded that complete independence is in Scotlandrsquos interests but I certainly think we should be going a lot further in that direction than we are at the moment.Mr Noble is the chairman of the Royal Caledonian Trust, a charity that supports the education of Armed Forces children. He is immediate past president of the Caledonian Society of London.During his career as a teacher, he was headmaster of Bexley, London, which was then the largest school in the capital. When he was a schoolboy himself, he attended Peebles High School.Conquered By No One will be published later this month by Hammer  Mirror Books.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form. We can do this using body awareness like I mentioned earlier but it can also be useful to video ourselves doing these exercises, to seewe can spot any issues.So there you have it, three things to keep in mind when doing these exercises:Use old habits to create new habits these exercises are an opportunity to practice movement form takes time and practice to develop.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting. It also supports the genealogy community as a whole."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Patel and Hancock should stop their insults and tell us the truth","story":"Clarity and tone are important too, of course,the human brain is to start processing dficult, often overwhelming information. Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad. Be honest when ministers get stuff wrong, or when they donrsquot know the answer to something. Be up front when the system is struggling to cope tell us what work is being done to remedy failures and give us a realistic assessment of whether the action will be successful.:Home Secretary lsquosorrypeople feel there have been failings over PPE supplyrsquoWe badly need a new, more direct approach, particularly from the UK Government, one that is better able to encompass the eye-popping statistics and harsh truths created by coronavirus.The current information vacuum grows more worrying by the day. After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable. And thatrsquos how you end up with the likes of Home Secretary Priti Patel, the coldest fish this side of Greenland, issuing a textbook  apology ndash ldquoIrsquom sorryYOU feel there are failings ndash at a recent daily briefing. This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

That the arrogance of this post-imperial country, with its delusions of Global Britain, led the UK elite to ignore the threat of Covid- until it was too late.Many Scottish nationalists feel much the same and say that Scotland has been harnessed to inept policies fashioned by a grossly incompetent Tory clique in Westminster.If only we could have closed the border with England, they sigh, looking at the way Jacinda Ardern has handled things in New Zealand, where the disease appears to have been stamped out by a total lockdown. At least for now.Reports that English firms had been declining requests from Scottish care homes for protective gear only confirm the suspicion that Scotland is a low priority, at the back of the queue, an afterthought.The SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is by no means alone in believing that Scotland would be better ldquodealing with [our] own problems unfettered..[like]Norway, Ireland. Many MSPs are saying so privately, and wondering why Nicola Sturgeon is not distancing herself from the ldquolaissez faire approach of the English Tories.It was certainly possible that Scotland could have taken a dferent path to the rest of the UK. Smaller countries like Iceland and Singapore moved faster in locking down against Covid . Ireland closed the schools earlier than we did and seems to have been much better at suppressing the disease. Certainly the crude death rate has been around half the UKrsquos.But there is a problem: throughout this crisis there has been no signicant dference between Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach to coronavirus and that of the other three nations in the four-nation pandemic alliance. SNP MPs may say that the Scottish Government was press-ganged into backing the UK approach to handling Covid- and that her instinct was to go for a much tougher lock down earlier. However, there is no basis for thinking this.When Leo Varadkar made his dramatic announcement on March  closing the schools in Ireland, the First Ministerrsquos response was that this was unnecessary. She said she agreed with her own medical advisers that the disease would likely be spread just as readily by children at home, and that the emergency services would be undermined by parents having to stay at home to look after their kids.As for testing, this was actually stopped by the Scottish Government in mid March. As the National Clinical Director, Professor Jason Leitch, told Channel  on March , ldquocommunity testing and contact-tracing was halted after the containment phase. The First Minister was fully aware of this. On April , standing next to Ms Sturgeon, the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said that testing was ldquoa distraction. This seemed to be a general view among UK medical advisers.Ms Sturgeon has said that she ldquofollowed the science. This has been the mantra used by ministers like the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, since this outbreak began. Many commentators regard this as a convenient excuse for incompetence. ldquoWhy didnrsquot they listen to dferent scientists and the World Health Organisation who were advising countries to test, test, test But Britain has some of the best epidemiologists in the world sitting on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies. The UK Chief Scientic Adviser, Professor Patrick Vallance, said again yesterday that ldquoI donrsquot think it is quite right that testing saves lives. Our medics still believe that tests should be confined to people who have symptoms and to essential workers. Mass testing will only make sense in their view when there is a reliable antibody test ndash and there isnrsquot one.Yet, testing and contact-tracing seems to have worked where, not just in South Korea, but in Germany where the death rate has been signicantly lower. Critics like Professor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, insist that the Scottish Government could and should have embarked on mass testing, though itrsquos not clear how it could have found the capacity so to do.She also claims that Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon adopted a ldquoherd immunity strategy because of ldquoBritish exceptionalism. Herd immunity has morphed into an ideological battle-ground, rather than an epidemiological truism.The problem for politicians like Ms Sturgeon is that they are expected to base their policy on ldquothe science, listen to the ldquoexperts, and make policy ldquoevidence based. But as soon as they do so, they are liable to be accused of listening to the wrong kind of scientists.Epidemiologists take a long view about the progress of a disease through its le-cycle involving several peaks and troughs. They have said from the start that since there is no vaccine,  per cent of us are going to get the disease anyway so there is no way of stopping it. That was one of the first remarks Ms Sturgeon made about Covid-.It is what the top UK advisers, like Professor Vallance meant when they were talking about herd immunity. In the absence of a vaccine, they believed that the only way the disease would die out would be when most of us were exposed to it. Prof Leitch was adamant on March  that : ldquothe alternative ndash closing the borders and locking everyone down ndash doesnrsquot work over a prolonged period.Thatrsquos as may be, but it now looks asthe politically savvy thing to have done was to ignore all this and go for a panic lockdown to show the voters that you are serious. In politics, doing something is always more appealing than not doing something.Scientists donrsquot have to answer to Twitter.

Top of it was a bottle of whisky, which entailed waiting for the cordon to be lted from the alcohol shelves at ten orsquoclock sharp. In my tweed coat and Alice-band I probably embody the profile of a rural alcoholic. Trying not to look desperate or furtive only made it worse.Whisky isnrsquot my tipple, but among my first thoughts ahead of the lockdown was to ensure we had enough wine to see us through. The problem, of course, is how to define enough. Judging by the spike in wine deliveries across the UK in March, many were equally eager to lay down a cellar ndash or in our case a boiler cupboard ndash for the troublesome times ahead. During the stampede, an Edinburgh friend reported that it wasnrsquot toilet roll she was having dficulty sourcing but tonic water, as the capital prepared to self-isolate with gin.Can alcohol be classed as necessary  Not by any medical standard of nutritional value. Yet for those living with ever-rising levels of anxiety, you could make a case that, as an aid to relaxing, and in creating a semblance or chimera of normality, it is as vital as vitamin C.It probably goes without saying that one personrsquos essential is anotherrsquos treat. Income plays some part in what we consider crucial to keep body and soul together. Yet beyond the basic and inarguable provisions for making decent meals and keeping the household clean, where exactly is the line that distinguishes justiable consumption from self-indulgence  And who is in a position to judge one from the other  On a scale of one to , for instance, how do ice-cream or pimento-stuffed olives score  Are beef burgers or pizzas the wisest way to eat, or could a police officer confiscate these and insist we replace them with broccoli and wild salmon Most worrying of all, for me at least, is whether we should be abstaining from olive oil, the ingredient without which no dinner in our house is considered complete, and replacing it with a local equivalent, thereby avoiding air miles, and supporting our own economy  If so, what would that stand-in be ndash dripping or lard While the police thankfully did a U-turn on its threat to put our shopping under surveillance, it will have made some of us considerably more self-conscious as we feed our goods onto the conveyor belt. I never normally give it a thought, but now Irsquoll be worrying what antisocial habits my trolley reveals.Doubtless the contents of most baskets would not cause an officer to pause for a nanosecond, unless they included a box of party invitations and enough barbecue coals to fuel a power station. But now the issue has been raised, it makes you re-evaluate every purchase.After rummaging through my wardrobe, I can probably get through to the end of the year without buying anything  other than plimsolls. By December I might be looking a little shabby, but thatrsquos hardly news. And, since mending and making do is enjoying a comeback, others will presumably be in much the same state.If nothing , this enforced stasis offers the space to reflect on how often what we buy is surplus to requirement. Compost bins and landfill must be groaning under the weight of food whose sell by date, like one of Douglas Adamsrsquos deadlines, whooshed by ages ago. Last week a neighbour discovered self-raising flour among her long-lost ingredients at the back of the cupboard and, after checking for weevils, enjoyed a baking spree with some equally ancient dried yeast. Going through his chest of drawers, my husband came upon a lovely unworn jumper of mine that is at least a decade old, but looks brand new. That I hadnrsquot noticed its absence speaks for itself.What previously felt like must-haves now simply suggest a reflex. The act of repeatedly reaching out and purchasing says more about a magpie urge to acquire than any critical shortage. This is not a puritanical call to give up the worldly or frivolous or, when the good times , to eschew the pleasures of things that, strictly speaking, we could get by without. Tens of thousands of businesses, artists and companies would be bankruptedwe adopted an ascetic lestyle that pared everything to the bone. In fact, when finally we unlock, we will actively need to help cash-strapped outfits and iniduals get back on their feet.As Europe takes its initial tentative steps towards easing restrictions, the notion of what is indispensable to daily existence moves beyond the hypothetical to something more profound. In some parts of Italy, bookshops, stationers and stores selling childrenrsquos and baby clothes are now being allowed to open, under strict conditions. In Austria, meanwhile, garden centres and hardware shops are back in business.These highly specic priorities are revealing of each nationrsquos personality. And while some would refute the idea that books or plants are anything other than accessories, Irsquod go to the barricades to defend both as central to survival. After sustenance and medication, we need a reason to exist beyond merely ticking over. The proleration of good bookshops in Italy shows its reverence for literature, a cultural bias that is confirmed by this decision. Perhaps the authorities recognise that, while enforced incarceration is likely to continue for some time, people must be allowed to feed their minds and imaginations as well as their stomachs.The same goes for gardening, which is a universal expression of the desire to nurture and grow.

The cry goes up that \"something must be done ndash we are failing our older people\". But the context is that in an average year nearly  per cent of deaths are in care homes. Of course we should not just shrug our shoulders and ignore avoidable shortening of le, but we should also recognise that care homes are clusters of highly vulnerable people. It is not surprising that an epidemic leads to many deaths in them.Anyone can get Covid- and anyone can die of it. But across the population as a whole it is predominantly people who are already vulnerable who are most likely to die. Age per se may not be a risk factor but it is a pretty good proxy for vulnerability. In ,  per cent of Sottish deaths were age -plus of Covid- deaths it is %.We cannot keep lockdown in place forever or even until some future promise of a vaccine. One way of partially exiting might be to remove most restrictions for those under age  who are not otherwise vulnerable. That would let most businesses, schools and so onmore normally. The interface between those released and those more vulnerable would be complicated to manage, but probably no more complicated than any other partial exit.We need to find ways to cope, physically and mentally, with a manageable number of severe cases and deaths from Covid- for the foreseeable future. The alternative is a devastated economy and shattered society.To avoid readers thinking this letter is from a young person seeking to benefit themself, Im  and my we is .Dave Gordon, Scone.BACK in Nazi Germany iniduals were valued for their usefulness to the state. If you were crippled, or old, or handicapped you were disposable. I would never have believed this philosophy was alive and well in  UK, but it is becoming clear from the horric statistics now emerging that a whole section of our community was excluded from the kind of intensive care which brought many, including Boris Johnson, back from the brink. South of the Border the policy was overt here there doesnrsquot seem to be a smoking gun, but the figures speak for themselvesThe callousness shown to the those needing support has been extended to those doing the supporting. A friend in England ed from sick leave to find that as a care assistant at her hospital she was denied any access to the limited supply of protective equipment. The story has been repeated here, again and again.When this is all over there will be inquiries as to why the UKrsquos handling of the pandemic has been so woeful compared to what happened in Germany and some other countries. I hope there will be a special focus on the events in British care homes. It is too much to expect that anyone will be punished, as they were in Germany in , but at least there can be naming and shaming and the bereaved relatives of care assistants and their charges will have some minor consolation.Martin Axford, Bridge of Weir.THE time will come when detailed consideration, which will include dficult political decisions, will have to be given as to how the mountain of debt incurred by the UK in the fight against the pandemic will be repaid. This involves serious amounts of money with the issue in a number of areas of what were effectively blank cheques.There are many who were embittered by the measures taken by Coalition and Conservative governments in what became known earlier as the  Years of Austerity. Those years led to key services being cut, including the NHS. The roll-out of Universal Credit pushed more people into poverty, some into deep poverty. As a result, food banks sprung up all over the country. Grants to councils in high areas of deprivation were cut substantially and consequently spending in these areas was the subject of deep reductions. There are those who believe that we were not quite all in it together. We must hope that the pain of dealing with the financial consequences of the pandemic in the UK are shared appropriately and equitably.There will be many who suffered during that much-discussed decade referred to who will share the views of Ernest Bevin in , when leader of the transport workers, when at a time of financial crisis he was resisting a % cut in unemployment benefit, who then said: \"City must not be saved at the expense of the working class.\"Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.WHEN we emerge from this hellish Coronavirus experience, the true financial cost to Scotland of coping must be revealed. I have no doubt the figure will confirm that had Scotland been independent, an SNP Government would have been totally financially incapable, in addition to the existing dire state of the economy, to manage without massive financial aid.No matter what the final cost will be, supporters of separation will never admit the inability to cope financially, preferring Scots to exist in penury for decades just to prove a point and to achieve some sort of misguided ldquofreedom. I have no doubt that the cost will make even the most staunch nationalist agree that separation is as dead as Monty Pythonrsquos parrot.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.SNP MP Douglas Chapman used the pandemic to draw an inappropriate comparison on Twitter between the number of deaths from Covid- in Scotland and England He tweeted: \"Recorded deaths from #COVID in England are double the rate of Scotland\" and pondering whether \"NHS Scotlandrsquos vastly superior AE performance \" or \"Scotlandrsquos  unique coronavirus assessment centres\" are the cause. Leaving aside his questionable data interpretation, the tweet implicitly demeans the extraordinary efforts of NHS staff and care workers in England to save lives. While \"them and us\" politics are a hallmark of Scottish nationalism, surely the tragedy of death tolls shouldnt be crowed over by anyone ndash and certainly not a senior member of the SNP establishment Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.I NOTE with interest Ian Lakins grim prediction that \"the extra shared cost for the UK could be around pound trillion which would increase the national debt by  per cent .I am puzzled by his apparent conclusion that this admittedly huge ndash as yet only estimated ndash increase in the UKs national debt would impact only on poor wee Scotland, and not on the rest of the UK, despite the apparently higher incidence of the virus south of the Border to date.Would it not be wiser by far to wait to seesuch a development actually occurs before rushing to such an ideologically motivated assumption Ian O Bayne, Glasgow G.THE World Health Organisation last week, in response to rumours that British American Tobaccowas developing a Covid- vaccine, said that ldquopartnership with the tobacco industry undermines governmentsrsquo credibility in protecting the population\" as there is \"a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the tobacco industryrsquos interests and public health policy interests.The tobacco industry ldquointerests have been accused of both knowingly driving addiction in developing countries and misrepresenting theof filters. This week we learn that BAT faces charges of sanctions busting. Why do we tolerate this awful industry that causes people to take up scarce hospital beds which could be displacing people with conditions that are not self-inflicted Given Covid- targets the lungs, itrsquos not a big leap to suggest that smokers are likely to be disproportionately affected once they catch this damnable virus. If we are not allowed out to play why are we still allowed to buy tobacco  This paradox is the freedom too far. With Covid- a worldwide scourge, there has never been a better time for the world to ban all tobacco production and turn the fields and the resources over to food production.John Dunlop, Ayr.WITH the country in lockdown, much of le is on hold and the nation waits for signs of salvation from the coronavirus crisis. Rays of hope shine out in the manest humanity responding to those most vulnerable to distress.At the fore of this are Sikhs in Scotland, who launched a major new initiative, the Sikh Food Bank, to address the growing needs of the vulnerable and elderly. Scotlandrsquos eight Gurdwaras, which normally serve more than , meals per week, were shuttered following Scottish Government advice to ban mass gatherings and to close all places of worship. This was especially dficult for Scottish Sikhs as these are normally a joyous few weeks where we would be celebrating Vaisakhi, the annual festival which marks the establishment of the Sikh Nation. Glasgow-dwellers will recall the distinctive procession of thousands of people dressed in vibrant colours singing through the streets of Glasgow, in the traditional Nagar Kirtan procession. This yearrsquos th Nagar Kirtan was cancelled for the first time ever such are the unique circumstances.The Sikh spirit of selfless service, or Seva, is a foundational belief. It was this which inspired the Sikh Food Bank ndash a network of volunteers who buy, package and deliver emergency food parcels to vulnerable people to their doorsteps.The Sikh Food Bank, driven by volunteers, utilises Gurdwara buildings to distribute emergency food parcels, provide hot meals and contact the vulnerable through a multi-lingual helpline. Taking inspiration from Guru Nanak, who established the Langar free kitchen, the Sikh Food Bank serves all communities, regardless of background or religion. The daily prayer of the Sikhs ends with a supplication ldquowe pray for the well-being of the whole of humanity ndash I cannot think of more apt words for these times.Charandeep Singh, Executive Director, Sikhs in Scotland, Glasgow G.MY daughter is an AE consultant putting her own and her familys lives on the line against the virus.

Even with thoughts of lugging heavy panniers full of day-to-day necessary detritus.Even knowing Id have to scrap with private hire drivers at junctions and dodge buses in cycle lanes.Thats a large part of the current joy. No scrapping, no narrow misses, no stress.The roads are so much emptier that the nagging fear always following at my shoulder, that heightened sense of potential doom, is gone.There are streets so quiet on my route that you can almost forget about motorised traffic and freewheel, carefree up the middle of the road. It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

This allowed the SAMS team to measure one of these eddies in detail.While this particular eddyrsquos surface temperature was similar to the surrounding water, masking it from satellites, its lower salt content made it stand out in the glider readings.Dr Marie Porter, a SAMS oceanographer and lead author on a report about the discovery,published in Geophysical Research Letters, said her findings had implications for understanding the distribution of nutrients that fuel the entire Arctic ecosystem.She said: ldquoWe get a pretty good idea about whatrsquos happening on the very surface of our ocean through satellites but eddies like this one have been hidden from view because they have warmed at the surface since leaving the Arctic.ldquoThis temperature masking means we have previously underestimated how much water moves within these patches in the Arctic Seas. It begs the question: how many more of these hidden eddies are occurring in the ocean today The water column of the Barents Sea has a seemingly simple structure where water from the Atlantic dominates in the south but in the north it is overlain by fresher, less dense water from the Arctic.This Arctic water is largely devoid of the nutrients required to fuel the growth of phytoplankton, which is key to maintaining le in the ocean.In contrast the Atlantic Water is one of the key pathways of nutrient rich water into the Arctic.Dr Porter added: ldquoHow these eddies affect this exchange is something we need to investigatewe are to truly understand the ocean ecosystem there.Arctic oceanographer Prof Finlo Cottier of SAMS, a co-author on the paper, said: ldquoSAMS has been working with ocean gliders for over a decade and we know that they are the ideal tool for measuring the detailed properties of the ocean.\"This work gives us precise measurements of important structures in the Arctic that we couldnrsquot previously obtain.The discovery was made during a two-week trial of the glider lsquoZephyrrsquo in July , ahead of a longer mission as part of the Arctic PRIZE project, funded by the Natural Environment Research Councilrsquos Changing Arctic Ocean programme."},{"url":null,"title":"town-brings-spirit-wigtown-book-festival-homes","story":"Now, with physical bookshops forced to shutter for the time being, the cherished town is bringing its literary sensibilities directly to readers.Wigtown Book Festival has launched a series of online events allowing book fans to embrace literature from the comfort of their homes.Coined #WigtownWednesdays, the festivalrsquos virtual line-up kicked off this week as more than  people gathered in their homes to listen to broadcaster and Sunday Times bestselling author Sally Magnusson discussing her new novel The Ninth Child.Future #WigtownWednesdays will feature adventurer Robert Twigger on Walking The Great North Line and philosopher Julian Baggini on lessons from a crisis.There are even plans for a virtual version of the Wigtownrsquos Got Talent competition, and there will also be the chance to take part in Stuart Kellyrsquos literary pub quiz, which is one of the most popular events of the annual book festival.And a monthly virtual bookclub will hold its first get-togethernext Wednesday.Those who join in will be able to virtually meet author of the memoir Native, Patrick Laurie ndash a Dumfries and Galloway-based conservation hill farmer.

That is the eventual way out of this.#Professor Pennington, who has chaired E.coli outbreak inquiries and in , was awarded a CBE for services to microbiology, believed the system could then be recreated on a large scale in other health board areas of Scotland.#The islands have good medical facilities, but you would need to have good and effective testing facilities in place with a quick result. It would not cost a lot of money.“It would be an example for the rest of the country as long as there was an early warning system in place. It could then be possible for the Highlands and Grampian to follow.#Hotspots will not last because people will either recover or sadly die. So we have to think of how we are going to get out of this.#Overall cases need to come down substantially — by about ten times — for the lockdown to be lted throughout the country. That is why we need test beds where levels are already low.#The virus has been spreading under the radar into places like care homes, presumably by workers who were unaware they were infected. The testing needs ramping up. The best you can say overall is that it is not now out of control, but we do not yet have control over it.#Professor Pennington, who has also been appointed by the Scottish Police Federation as a coronavirus advisor, warned that a vaccine will reduce the number of COVID- deaths, but will not offer complete protection or eradicate the virus.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us. However old your photo is, as long as it has a picture of a puffin with food in its beak, and you know when and where it was taken, it will help.“Those who join the Puffarazzi are filling key gaps in our knowledge, helping us to understand what threats are facing these little seabirds.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

The couple share their Kensington Road home of  years with around  teddy bears of all shapes and sizes, collected over the past few decades.Having been encouraged by their four grandchildren, the couple came up with quirky presentations of the bears on their lawn, which is putting smiles on many faces, both young and old.In a bid to banish the boredom during their own self-isolation, Morrisand Jennyare keeping busy by meticulously arranging their daily displays, swapping bears in and out, giving their teddies dferent props, or moving them around the corner of the front garden.Behind it all is Jenny#s lelong love of teddy bears - she still has her very first bear Ted, given to her when she was just  months old. Morris did all the buying of the bears when he used to travel a lot for business, Jenny said.For  years he would always bring back a Harrods bear from London and they all sit on the stairs of our house. It became a tradition that when he would go away, he brought back a bear. Our kids and my brothers and sisters all bought bears for me down the years for Christmas and birthdays so we have accumulated a lot over the years.Alongside Brown Thomas bears sit several Paddingtons and others purchased at Aston Villa, Derby County, Wimbledon and ious Northern Ireland away games. Morris, however, called a halt to the bear buying  years ago once the teddy takeover became a bit too much. Now they take pride of place in the front garden each day, much to the delight of passers-by.What started off on day one as a small Teddy#s Bear Picnic has grown to much larger displays including a sports day, cricket match, Lego building, classroom scene, cycling trip, gardening and even a religious service on Easter Sunday. We began on day one with just four bears sitting out in the garden with tables and chairs and that was going to be it. But we got so many comments about it that we thought we#d better do something the next day, so it has grown from that, Morris said. The bears have a wee chat at night about what they want to do the next day and then let us know their plan in the morning so we try to accommodate them.We have had a constant stream of people coming past for a look every day. Until a few days ago we only knew a couple of our neighbours on both sides of the street, but now we#re meeting people we#ve never seen before. It has become a great talking point and people seem to look forward to it every day. The bears usually stay out until around  o#clock at night and then they all have to be put to bed. Thankfully the weather has been tremendous every day so far but we do have umbrellas, tents and gazebos in case of a rainy day.

The income of inidual artists has reduced by an average of just over £,.Theatres, cinemas, museums, galleries and arts venues have had to close because of the virus crisis. For inidual artists, some of whom work with the elderly or with children in care homes, hospitals, school and youth clubs, the lockdown means they cannot reach their usual audiences.The report said the financial impact of the lockdown will be signicant for many of Northern Ireland#s artists because it restricts their ability to trade and earn income from their performances. It added: The closure of arts venues, theatres, community art facilities, galleries, schools and community hubs has severely restricted the ability of organisations to deliver community outreach and public-facing services, vital for the wellbeing of vulnerable groups in society and for artiststo earn an income and develop their practice.This has compromised the ability of some artists working in inter and intra-community contexts to build relationships with participants through their creativity, potentially compromising important peace-building work.A signicant proportion of visual artists have been unable to work since the shutdown because access to their studios has been cut off. This has had a creative impact and further compounds the economic consequences of their work not reaching markets due to the closure of galleries and retail outlets. The Arts Council report surveyed more than  artists and arts organisations across Northern Ireland between March  and April .Based on data from  organisations, it said the anticipated income loss was expected to total £.m ­- an average of £, per organisation. This ied signicantly depending on the scale of the organisation responding.The report also found that organisations that depend on earned sources such as the box-office income were particularly vulnerable to financial losses during the crisis.The report follows the establishment by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey at the end of March of a special £m Covid- support fund.The package is aimed at artists, performers and others across the arts and cultural sector in Northern Ireland.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wayne Rodgers, a member of Magherafelt-based wedding band The Allstars, has been entertaining residents since lockdown brough an abrupt end to his normal work. “Everything has just fallen off a clf, it’s all stopped overnight,” he told the County Derry Post. “Mark Stewart, who runs a bar in Magherafelt, said some of the homes were askinghe could suggest anything entertainment-wise. “The Manor Nursing home [in Magherafelt] was the first one I did. They had me back so I couldn’t have been too bad!” googletag.cmd.push A driving instructor by day, Wayne says he wanted to bring the residents of the care homes a bit of joy at a time when they are not allowed to have visitors. He said: “I’m not an essential worker but I’m not doing anyone any harm. I’m there on my own and it’s entertainment for them and gives them something to look forward to.” “They throw a sterilised plug out the window to me and I plug that into my own equipment. There’s no contact made. “It breaks up my day. It’s as good for me as it is for them. You can hear them clapping and singing behind the windows. googletag.cmd.push  “It’s sad - some of the relatives would come and sit in cars. They can’t go in to see their parents. They can only wave through the window and it’s very tough on everybody, strained times. “Some of the homes are doing wee videos from inside and posting them online so the families can see them all enjoying themselves, singing and clapping along.” Wayne is now a man in demand as word spreads of his singing exploits, and has performances lined up both in his adopted County Derry and native town of Ballynahinch. He said: “We did one and then another got in touch. My brother in law arranged four in Ballynahinch on Monday, so I’ve done about ten now at this stage. “I don’t like forcing people or anything, but this week I’ve been asked back to a few I’ve done before because the residents are enjoying it so much. “I have another three lined up this week with a possibility of a few more coming on board.” The old classics are proving popular as Wayne does the rounds, with one song in particular being requested on every occasion. “They all seem to love Danny Boy,” he said. “It seems to bring back memories. A lot of the patients in the homes have dementia and it seems to be a song that takes them home. They like the classics, the ballads – all songs from their era.” Although the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, there was one voice of dissent who would have preferred not to have Wayne singing outside his window. “I got one negative comment. I was in Ballynahinch the other day and a man said ‘what’s your name son ’ So I answered and he said ‘well will you feck off, I can’t hear the TV!’ “He didn’t enjoy it as much as the others, but it gave everybody a laugh.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While the data only provides a sample of those who opted in, it indicates that most people in the constituency areas covering County Derry are heeding the warnings.

Insufficient data was available to track the footfall in Mid Ulster’s parks, but the results did show that visits to grocery and pharmacies experienced a % drop. Causeway Coast and Glens has the lowest number of confirmed Covid- cases in Northern Ireland, and it also had the largest drop in retail and recreation footfall of the county’s three constituencies at %. googletag.cmd.push The council area also had the largest drop in people visiting transit stations and workplace locations, while visits to parks have fallen by %.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chhindwara in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalia. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chhindwara. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in a local village. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chhindwara. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in a local village. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police.

That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives.

On Lyra’s first anniversary I want to re-state the commitment of the police service to work with you as we collectively seek to release communities from the influence of terrorists. “For the purposes of this investigation, I will offer anonymity to those who wish to talk to us. All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that. Talk to us. Ease your conscience and help us resolve a small part of the nightmare that the McKee family live through every single day.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Castledawson man Dean McErlean made the discovery while walking his dogs at the foot of the Moyola River, where it enters Lough Neagh. “It says ‘Joseph McManmoy’ on it,” he told the County Derry Post. “We would take the dogs down there for a walk and let them swim and we found it lying in the sand. It was half-buried but I saw the top of it. “It doesn’t look like a medicine bottle – it’s clear. I knew it was old glass because you could still see the bubbles in it, and it wasn’t symmetrical. googletag.cmd.push “I knew it was a good age, but I didn’t know what it was for, whether it was for whiskey or medicine or anything.” Dean then took to the internet to seehe could unearth any details about the mysterious ‘Joseph McManmoy’, but his search drew a blank. “The first thing I did was Google it, but there was absolutely nothing and no name the same. It’s not a usual name. “The name has thrown everybody that I have asked because it’s so unusual.” The search for any trace of the name is still ongoing, but Dean has ensured the bottle has found a safe home. googletag.cmd.push He said: “An aunty of mine is big into traditional, vintage, oddly shaped stuff. “She would have wee medicine bottles and stuff around the house, so I took it home to her. She loved it, she was like an excited child.” While his efforts to find Mr McManmoy have not yet proved fruitful, Dean has his own theory about how the bottle came to rest on the Loughshore. “I would say it has come down the Moyola and washed out in the floods over the wintertime. God knows how long it was lying somewhere .”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In response to the Covid- pandemic, food is being delivered every week to households in need across the city as a result of the link-up between Apex Housing Association and the charity Fareshare. The surplus food supplies, collected by Fareshare from local supermarkets including Tesco and Asda, are being delivered by Apex to four areasof the city – Ballyarnett, Foyleside, The Moor and Waterside. Emergency food parcels and hot meals are also being distributed by local groups. googletag.cmd.push Donna Matthewson, Apex Director of Housing, said they were delighted with how the initiative was operating. “Over the last number of years we have developed an excellent relationship with Fareshare, delivering fresh food to eleven local charities on an on-going basis,” she said. “Recently we have seen the impact Covid- has had on families in this city and this new service with Fareshare has been established as a result. “We are delighted to be able to assist in redirecting these vital food supplies to those who need them most. “Feedback from community groups has been fantastic and we hope to continue this service for the duration of the pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push Ciara Ferguson from Greater Shantallow Area Partnership praised the food delivery scheme. “This service has allowed us to provide much needed food parcels for those who have negatively impacted by the Covid- crisis. “The food is of great quality and iety and the extra help means the world to our local families whose incomes have been reduced as a result of the pandemic.” If you or someone you know is struggling to afford or access food during the Covid- pandemic, contact your local DEA partnership office:Outer North-   Outer West-   Triax-   Waterside-     If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is the latest jinx in a long series of mishaps which have bedevilled the garage proprietor.The Rice family moved to Drumaness in what seemed the final chapter in a long running wrangle over a smoke problem at their home in Carlisle Park, Ballynahinch.The fire destroyed almost everything and it was in response to the ldquoraw deal which Mr Rice was getting that the Drumaness committee was formed.The Drumaness Community Action Committee is only eight-strong, but a spokesman pointed out that they had the backing of the whole community.A collection was taken around the Drumaness district last week and raised more than pound for Mr Rice. Since then donations have been pouring in and already another pound has been collected.The spokesman added: ldquoWe think he [Mr Rice] is getting a raw deal and we are determined to do something about it.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Work is well underway on a pound, environmental improvement scheme for Ballynahinch Square.The scheme, which will give the much-maligned square a major facelt, has been brought about after much pressure from the local chamber of commerce.The chamber has been pushing for the resurfacing of the square for over a decade, but the breakthrough didnrsquot occur until late last year when negotiations between the owners, the Ker Estate, and the Department of the Environment were finally completed.The scheme will entail the resurfacing of the square, the planting of shrubs, the building of a lsquositting wallrsquo and the re-use of flower boxes.

They noted with regret that the council was again unable to give them any support.The committee agreed there was great interest in the town on their ambitious plans, particularly the initiative to build a replica of the Ferguson monoplane, and it was agreed that an appeal for funds to local businesses, hotels and guest houses would have to be made in the near future.Mr Fergusonrsquos daughter will be coming to Newcastle on July and it is hoped she will attend the Miss Newcastle ball, which will be held in the Slieve Donard Hotel that night, and the festival parade the following day.DOWNPATRICK mdash A call has been made this week for the public to help stamp out vandalism in the Downpatrick area.It comes from Downpatrick councillor, Mr Cecil Maxwell, who felt he had to speak out after three incidents at Downpatrick Cathedral last week when excrement was littered around the building.ldquoIt is sad that a holy place is vandalised, especially in Holy Week, he said. ldquoThe time has come for the general public to stop this sheer vandalism.Appealing for more co-operation from the public with the police, Mr Maxwell pointed out that other churches and schools in the area had also suffered severely at the hands of vandals.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar Choral Societyrsquos ninth annual concert, Sing A Rainbow, will be presented next Tuesday and Wednesday in the War Memorial Hall, Crossgar.Such is the standard of this musical event that the society plays to full houses every year and there is no doubt that this yearrsquos production will be correspondingly attended.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

Clearly the vast majority of people heeded the advice they had been given, but there were a number of issues involving young people drinking together, the councillor continued.ldquoThe lsquostay at home messagersquo has got through but there is no room for complacency. We need to keep this up and while I appreciate that it is dficult and frustrating for many to stay at home and only venture outside for essential supplies, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.Cllr Clarke said while everyonersquos focus was on doing everything they could to stay safe, he believed that the pandemic will pass.ldquoWe all have a role to play to ensure that this happens as soon as possible, he said. ldquoPeople are yearning for ato normality, but we all need to play out part to ensure that this happens.Cllr Clarke said the impact of the lockdown was having a major impact on businesses in Newcastle who rely heavily upon tourism and who are suffering as a result of the current restrictions on businesses opening.ldquoBusiness has been devastated and I hope that those who have been forced to close will be provided with all the help and support they deserve moving forward, he continued.Cllr Clarke also praised all frontline NHS workers and Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff for continuing to deliver services in the face of the pandemic.He added: ldquoWe owe these people so much.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Wersquove got the capacity to do it.Matthew went on to describe the atmosphere at Llandough Hospital.ldquoWersquore both in Penarth and wersquove lived here all our lives. Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With lockdown and social distancing, itrsquos crucial that we keep residents informed, and modern technology allows us to do that.One of those conversations was with Cllr Lis Burnett, Deputy Leader of the Vale Council. I raised some of the most common questions that Irsquom receiving from constituents, to find out how the authority is supporting residents, including:School provision: The Vale is using a hub system, with  schools providing services am-to-pm, seven days a week, for children of key workers and vulnerable children. Vouchers for free school meals are being issued to all who qualy every two weeks.Older shielding residents: For those without support from family and friends, the council has set up a Crisis Support Team to help with access to shopping, medication, and urgent temporary assistance. See the lsquoProtecting Vulnerable Peoplersquo section of the dedicated coronavirus page on the website www.valeofglamorgan.gov.ukBusinesses: There is a regularly-updated Business section on the councilrsquos coronavirus page, which should be the first point of call for all local businesses looking for assistance. Over pound million has already been distributed, and yoursquore encouraged to apply for support as soon as possible.Council staff: Staff are helping however they can some from non-essential services are doing waste collections, others are providing care. Itrsquos making a huge dference, and a recruitment drive for temporary care staff has also been a success.Volunteering: Local people are stepping up, and the Vale is supporting them via its Vale Heroes page on the website.Council tax bills: If you are worried about paying your council tax, get in touch with the department.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

arrangements for summer exams ","story":"EDUCATION Minister Peter Weir has outlined the process for students completing GCSE and A level qualications in .This is for students taking examinations set by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations  Assessmentwhich provides the majority of examinations in Northern Ireland - % of A levels and % of GCSEs.Key points include:Calculated grades will be issued for those completing their A level, A S level and GCSE qualications based on a combination of information provided by schools and colleges and statistical information.A S level grades will count as a stand-alone qualication they will not contribute to a final A level grade in .Grades will be awarded for GCSEs due to complete in  , but not for GCSE units where GCSEs are due to complete in  . In the latter case, pupils will have the option to take any outstanding units in  and have missing components calculated using statistical modelling and or to sit all units in  and be awarded the higher grade from either option.Speaking in the Assembly today, Peter Weir said: “In March, I announced that, in line with other jurisdictions of the UK, GCSE, AS and A level exams would not proceed in Northern Ireland in summer .“My priority is to ensure that pupils receive fair results that reflect their hard work and enable judgements to be made about their future progression to study or employment or other avenues.“CCEA, the local examinations body, together with officials from my departments and others in the education sector have been working tirelessly to develop an alternative process.“This is a very complex process and there is still more work to be completed, however, it is vital that pupils and their families receive some clarity on this issue.” Consultation on the preferred options has been carried out with key education stakeholders, including head teachers’ representatives and teaching unions.The Minister said: “Today, I have set out how qualications will be awarded for GCSE and A level pupils. This will involve teachers using their professional judgement together with an extensive range of evidence held by schools, and statistical modelling. There will also be a process for standardising outcomes across school and other examination centres.“The development of an appropriate appeals mechanism is also under consideration, as well as arrangements for private candidates.“Whilst there will not be an opportunity for pupils to take re-sits in the autumn, they can, of course, choose to re-sit in the summer of . I will also seek to align the issuing of results with England and Wales , thus ensuring that local candidates are not put at a disadvantage.”Continuing, the Minister said that officials were also working closely with colleagues in the Department for the Economy on arrangements for vocational qualications. Details will be announced by the Economy Minister as soon as that work has been completed.He said: “I have instructed CCEA to take forward work to implement these decisions, and they will issue more detailed guidance to schools, pupils and parents as a matter of urgency.“My officials have consulted with key education stakeholders, including head teachers’ representatives and teaching unions, on the preferred options presented by CCEA. In reaching my decisions I have taken account of the views expressed through these consultations.“I am reassured that all parties recognise that there is no perfect solution, but agree that we have identied the most appropriate available solutions given the unprecedented circumstances.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_cbcadfbbddfad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_cafcaadddcacc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
