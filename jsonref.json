You can understand why, when he cares that much and he’s been banging the drum for this long,’ Harry said.Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge cited Charles’s devotion to his Prince’s Trust charity, which has helped more than 900,000 young people.

Pictured: Presenter Sandi Toksvig consoling him after the incidentWhether viewers will recall the name of last night’s victor a year from now is anyone’s guess. But one thing is certain: if it takes a nervous disposition, a slightly nutty character and a disarming lack of self-confidence to make a Bake Off hero, then Rahul Mandal, who emerged blinking and victorious at the end of this series, fits the bill perfectly.So did his closest rival, super-shy Kim-Joy Hewlett. The third finalist, Ruby Bhogal, revealed she had to bolster her self-belief by scribbling inspirational quotes on Post-It notes and plastering them over her fridge.With so much attention focused on the finalists, all of Asian heritage, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith were almost by-standers. Sandi Toksvig and her co-presenter Noel Fielding had more to do, mostly comforting the contestants and talking them out of their panics. But it’s a shame that in 2018 some television personalities still feel they have to flash their cleavage to get themselves noticed.Noel spent the whole weekend with his psychedelic shirt open to the solar plexus, displaying skin as white as an albino rat with a tuft of limp chest hair.It wasn’t an appetising sight. He looked like a tubby Dracula, in need of a spray tan and a waxing.          Rahul, pictured with his mother as a baby in Kolkata, India, only took up baking two years ago having never made a cake before          Close-ups of the smashed storage jar show it had shattered all over Rahul\u0027s bench, making it impossible for him to finish the challengeTry as he might to distract the cameras, all the attention was on the search for the Most Overwrought Baker. King of the Nervous Nellies was Rahul, who appears to be a frightened 11-year-old boy trapped in the body of an undersized man aged 30. During the technical challenge, when the finalists were sent outside to bake pitta breads on open fires, Rahul flung his arm up in the air like a schoolboy desperate to be excused games. ‘I need help, am I doing it right?’ he pleaded.A nd after presenter Sandi gently explained that she wasn’t able to give advice, he muttered sadly, ‘I’d better just not come tomorrow. Just utter disgrace.’Rahul began each morning with a glass of milk. I suspect this is because his mother told him to do this when he was four, and he is still an obedient boy.But all that calcium doesn’t seem to have stiffened his spine: ‘I am very, very, very nervous,’ he admitted at the start of the final signature bake, featuring decorated doughnuts.Not that he’d ever been brave enough to actually try tasting one. ‘It looks like deep-fried bread,’ he fretted. ‘I’m not going to eat it.’ Quite right – harm could come to a young fellow.          Kim-Joy (left) and Ruby (right) celebrate as Rahul is announced as the winner of the Bake Off in front of adoring friends and family          Rahul also got a hug from judge Paul Hollywood in the aftermath of the result as contestants and judges celebrated after the announcement          Rahul was held aloft by his family and friends as he celebrated his win alongside many of the bakers who appeared in this year\u0027s competitionAs tension mounted in the tent, Rahul recited his catchphrase ever more quickly: ‘I literally don’t know what I am doing.’Eventually, his anxiety reached such a pitch that it became paranormal, and caused one of the glass storage jars on his workbench to detonate.The production crew blamed the 32C (90F) heat in the marquee. But we all know that glass doesn’t simply explode on warm summer days, or tropical countries wouldn’t be able to have windows in their houses.That jar disintegrated because Rahul’s terror had set off a vibration of physical intensity.‘This is a sign from God that I need to stop baking,’ he wailed as he swept up the fragments.Kim-Joy tried to match his levels of eccentricity, by building a ruined temple in Atlantis out of gingerbread, and Ruby popped a unicorn on her profiteroles, but there was only ever going to be one winner.‘Oh no-no-no-no-no,’ he mumbled. But oh yes, Rahul – you’re this year’s Star Baker. Better get used to it.

I never meant to hurt her. I know I keep disappointing her. But she is my soul,\u0027 Hernandez told Baez.\u0027She is all I have and will ever have.\u0027Baez then told Jenkins, and writes that while she was blindsided and felt \u0027betrayed,\u0027 she remained by Hernandez\u0027s side. Hernandez and Baez met in 2016, when the then-26-year-old was serving a life sentence for the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013 and had just been indicted for an earlier double-homicide. The prominent attorney helped Hernandez win an acquittal in those murders on April 14, 2017, and was planning to appeal the previous conviction before the athlete killed himself days later on April 19 in the maximum security prison.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) continue to conduct its investigations as it tries to establish what caused Saturday\u0027s tragedy. It emerged today that the model of helicopter involved in the crash, an AgustaWestland AW169, has a \u0027blemish-free\u0027 record.A spokesman for its manufacturer told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027This is the first ever accident involving an AW169 helicopter.\u0027           He is fifth on the Thailand richlist of billionaires and is said to be worth close to £4billionSrivaddhanaprabha was born in Bangkok on April 4, 1958 to a Thai Chinese family.The Thai billionaire Srivaddhanaprabha kick-started his business journey by opening a duty free shop back in Bangkok in 1989 at the age of 31.His retail company, King Power, is now a staple of the country\u0027s airports and the brand also have the naming rights to Leicester City\u0027s stadium.Having been the club\u0027s primary shirt sponsor for the three previous seasons, he wanted to step up his involvement and opted to go all in and become owner.Buying the club for a reported £39million in 2010 proved a shrewd investment as he oversaw a meteoric rise which saw the Foxes historically win the Premier League title in 2015-16.When he took over, the club had just earned promotion from League One, the third tier in the English football pyramid, and with Nigel Pearson trusted to remain in charge, the Foxes were quickly back in the Premier League.According to Forbes, the Midlands club is now valued at £371m after becoming a staple of the top half in the league under Srivaddhanaprabha\u0027s reign.Ranked as fifth on Forbes\u0027 Thailand rich list, Srivaddhanaprabha has built his empire up to a staggering $4.9billion (£3.8bn).

Pictured: Presenter Sandi Toksvig consoling him after the incidentWhether viewers will recall the name of last night’s victor a year from now is anyone’s guess. But one thing is certain: if it takes a nervous disposition, a slightly nutty character and a disarming lack of self-confidence to make a Bake Off hero, then Rahul Mandal, who emerged blinking and victorious at the end of this series, fits the bill perfectly.So did his closest rival, super-shy Kim-Joy Hewlett. The third finalist, Ruby Bhogal, revealed she had to bolster her self-belief by scribbling inspirational quotes on Post-It notes and plastering them over her fridge.With so much attention focused on the finalists, all of Asian heritage, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith were almost by-standers. Sandi Toksvig and her co-presenter Noel Fielding had more to do, mostly comforting the contestants and talking them out of their panics. But it’s a shame that in 2018 some television personalities still feel they have to flash their cleavage to get themselves noticed.Noel spent the whole weekend with his psychedelic shirt open to the solar plexus, displaying skin as white as an albino rat with a tuft of limp chest hair.It wasn’t an appetising sight. He looked like a tubby Dracula, in need of a spray tan and a waxing.          Rahul, pictured with his mother as a baby in Kolkata, India, only took up baking two years ago having never made a cake before          Close-ups of the smashed storage jar show it had shattered all over Rahul\u0027s bench, making it impossible for him to finish the challengeTry as he might to distract the cameras, all the attention was on the search for the Most Overwrought Baker. King of the Nervous Nellies was Rahul, who appears to be a frightened 11-year-old boy trapped in the body of an undersized man aged 30. During the technical challenge, when the finalists were sent outside to bake pitta breads on open fires, Rahul flung his arm up in the air like a schoolboy desperate to be excused games. ‘I need help, am I doing it right?’ he pleaded.A nd after presenter Sandi gently explained that she wasn’t able to give advice, he muttered sadly, ‘I’d better just not come tomorrow. Just utter disgrace.’Rahul began each morning with a glass of milk. I suspect this is because his mother told him to do this when he was four, and he is still an obedient boy.But all that calcium doesn’t seem to have stiffened his spine: ‘I am very, very, very nervous,’ he admitted at the start of the final signature bake, featuring decorated doughnuts.Not that he’d ever been brave enough to actually try tasting one. ‘It looks like deep-fried bread,’ he fretted. ‘I’m not going to eat it.’ Quite right – harm could come to a young fellow.          Kim-Joy (left) and Ruby (right) celebrate as Rahul is announced as the winner of the Bake Off in front of adoring friends and family          Rahul also got a hug from judge Paul Hollywood in the aftermath of the result as contestants and judges celebrated after the announcement          Rahul was held aloft by his family and friends as he celebrated his win alongside many of the bakers who appeared in this year\u0027s competitionAs tension mounted in the tent, Rahul recited his catchphrase ever more quickly: ‘I literally don’t know what I am doing.’Eventually, his anxiety reached such a pitch that it became paranormal, and caused one of the glass storage jars on his workbench to detonate.The production crew blamed the 32C (90F) heat in the marquee. But we all know that glass doesn’t simply explode on warm summer days, or tropical countries wouldn’t be able to have windows in their houses.That jar disintegrated because Rahul’s terror had set off a vibration of physical intensity.‘This is a sign from God that I need to stop baking,’ he wailed as he swept up the fragments.Kim-Joy tried to match his levels of eccentricity, by building a ruined temple in Atlantis out of gingerbread, and Ruby popped a unicorn on her profiteroles, but there was only ever going to be one winner.‘Oh no-no-no-no-no,’ he mumbled. But oh yes, Rahul – you’re this year’s Star Baker. Better get used to it.

And if you want to join in with your own woolly tribute, our knitting pattern shows the way.How easy is it? Please don’t look too closely at my petals, which look like they have caught some kind of deadly blight. And my leaf has somehow ended up looking more like a coral reef than a poppy leaf, but I was knitting at speed. Once my poppy takes its place, hopefully in a beautiful cascade in my local church, no one will notice the occasional dropped or knotted stitch.The poppy is knitted on small 2mm needles, which does make it rather fiddly. Woman’s Weekly, which supplied the pattern, recommends that you use a particular type of wool made with cotton, especially if you want to wear it on your lapel. That would definitely add a bit of structure and class to your poppy, but I just used what I had at home: John Lewis Knit in 902 Red and Rowan Alpaca Soft in 00215 Green, both double knit. The black centre was knitted with a scrap of old wool. There is nothing too complicated here, give or take the leaves.A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why.  Jan Moir: A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why  STEP ONE — THE FLOWER : Start with the petals, which are knitted inidually. You will need four of them and have to master simple techniques such as ‘wrapping’ stitches, knitting twice into each stitch and casting off purl wise          STEP TWO — THE CENTRE: Easy! Four rows plus casting off. Even I managed this without error          STEP THREE — The STEM: If you can cast on eight stitches and knit 26 rows in stocking stitch, then you are home and dry          STEP FOUR — THE LEAVES: I had to rip back my leaves twice, but it is worth it in the end. You have to cast on and cast off multiple times, then slip, knit and slipover repeatedly. Just when you think, how on earth can this woolly spaghetti possibly look like a plant, a sheaf of leaves unfolds like a magic trick  STEP FIVE — THE STITCH UP: Stitching it all together is the fun part. Sew along the edges of the stem. Then assemble the petals, with the cast-on ends in the centre.

Governors general, ambassadors and prime ministers will learn first. But in the world of 24-hour news it will not stay secret for long.Prince William clashed with Charles over whether Buckingham...Share this articleAll this, however, is jumping the gun. Given the Queen’s history of robust health, perhaps a far more likely scenario is that her great age will mean she herself will trigger a period of regency, thus ensuring safe stewardship of the great office she has held and worked so hard to secure.Senior former members of her household believe the Queen will grant her eldest son the full power to reign while she still lives because of the respect she holds for the institution of monarchy.Abdication, however, is not even a consideration. One senior aide admitted to me the ‘dusting off’ of the Regency Act. My understanding is that senior figures, with the Queen’s blessing, have been examining various scenarios.      Practical and unsentimental about her advancing years, the Queen, who is known around Whitehall as Reader No 1, has had Charles added to the distribution list of despatch boxes that she is sent. In the event of her death or inability to continue through illness, the Queen has ensured that her heir is fully primed and ready to take over.Some close to the monarch say that, if she reaches the age of 95, she will make a monumental decision and choose to officially allow Charles to take over the stewardship of her reign.She will, they say, officially transfer all executive powers to him as Prince Regent until her death, when he will become king. This would enable her to fudge the issue of her not fulfilling her Coronation Oath to God and her people to serve as queen regnant until her death.          Prince Charles (pictured) is effectively already our \u0027Prince Regent\u0027, a king in all but name Others, who claim to be equally well informed, say that such a move or use of the ‘Regent’ title is not really necessary. After all, as the Queen made clear to the unassuming 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, when he went to see her on the occasion of his resignation in her Golden Jubilee year of 2002: ‘That’s something I can’t do.’Times, however, do change. In truth, with the Queen now well into her tenth decade, senior officials within the Royal Household confirm that Prince Charles is effectively already our ‘Prince Regent’, a king in all but name.Granted, Her Majesty is a consecrated monarch who pledged in her coronation oath to serve throughout her life. But can she seriously remain as head of state if she lives to be a centenarian like her mother?The last time the Regency Act was invoked was in 1810 during the reign of George III, when the monarch became permanently deranged. It meant his eldest son assumed the title Prince Regent for ten years until, on his father’s death, he became George IV.Queen Elizabeth II has enjoyed remarkably good health, both mental and physical, and there is nothing to suggest that Regency would be necessary in the way that it was for George III.Behind palace gates, however, preparations have been made in recent months for all eventualities, with Her Majesty’s blessing.Strangely, until 1937, our constitutional law had no permanent provision for a regent to cover the situation of a monarch being incapable of performing his or her duties.It was the debilitating illness of the Queen’s grandfather, George V — who suffered from chronic bronchitis from 1935 until his death — that led to the reformed Regency Act including the intriguing possibility of a Regency if ‘the Sovereign is for some definite cause not available for the performance of those functions’. It is not clear what situations this covers.Perhaps it is vague enough to allow the monarch simply to pass the baton to her heir and effectively retire — thus effecting the smoothest of successions with the minimum of fuss.The Queen is au courant with the passage of time, and how her age impacts on the institution she serves. She has, impeccable sources have told me, already drawn a line in the sand, a date when, like Prince Philip, she will effectively retire from public life.          The Queen doesn\u0027t seem to be slowing down on her royal engagements. Earlier this month she met with Queen MaximaNobody has a crystal ball. But my knowledge of the monarchal system leads me to believe that, whatever happens, it will unfold naturally. It is clear, however, that Charles’s position as the driving force of the institution in the second decade of the 21st century, as he approaches his 70th birthday, is indisputable. He, not the Queen, is the firm hand on the tiller.In the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, many long-serving staff at Buckingham Palace believed the public would never tolerate Charles becoming king.Since then, however, anger against Charles has subsided.Through hard work and consistency, and perhaps the popularity of his sons and their wives — and the goodwill they have generated — such fears have all but disappeared.He may still be blamed for Diana’s misery over his infidelity with Camilla Parker Bowles, but there’s no longer a groundswell of support for skipping a generation.It was the Queen herself who eventually urged him to resolve the ‘Camilla problem’ by marrying his lover. Mindful of his duty, Charles complied.This was a smoothing of the way forward to the next generation, not simply the glorious resolution of Charles and Camilla’s enduring grand romance.It was made clear to Charles that he had to fit in with the bigger picture and accept the shifting shape of the monarchy as envisaged by the Queen. It was a calculated risk and it appears to have paid off. The warm receptions given to Charles and Camilla when on tour, and the more positive Press coverage of Camilla, is increasingly gentle but never effusive.More recently, on her 90th birthday, the Queen took the key decision to elevate Camilla to her most senior advisory body, the Privy Council. As ever, this was all done very quietly. And, as ever, the Queen had her reasons.          Camilla is set to be Queen. Queen Elizabeth had urged Charles to marry herShe wanted her daughter-in-law to be at Charles’s side at the precise moment that he formally becomes King.This will now happen: as a privy councillor, Camilla can now attend the ceremony, normally held within 24 hours of a sovereign’s death.This leads to a more contentious question: will Camilla become Queen? Ever since the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall in April 2005, the Royal Family have gone to great lengths to avoid any public uprising over the prospect of ‘Queen Camilla’.Indeed, the official wedding announcement stated: ‘It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH the Princess Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne.’The critical word in this statement, of course, was ‘intended’. What Clarence House was doing was buying time — time for a hostile public to warm to Camilla.Prince Charles, however, has always intended her to become his queen consort.According to an inside source, he’d already decided that before their wedding.‘There was no doubt in his mind at the time about that, and I honestly don’t think anything has changed,’ said the source.‘In fact, I think he has hardened his resolve.‘For there to be any other outcome would, in his view, be to lessen his role as king.‘His marriage to Camilla is legal. She happens to be his second wife. That is it. Did any of Henry VIII’s wives not get the title?’Although Camilla has worked hard and proved a great support to her husband over the years, there is no escaping the lingering feeling that Charles’s greatest asset is also his greatest weakness.Camilla, as consort and Duchess of Cornwall, is a constant reminder of his personal failings of the past. However, more than a decade of marriage, and the fact that his second wife undoubtedly gives strength from their mutual and obvious love, should be taken only as a positive.But no matter how optimistic the palace try to be, the reality is that Charles and Camilla have both brought far too much baggage to the relationship, particularly that they committed adultery — which at the very least contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Diana — for it to be presented as anything approaching love’s young dream.I am told that Camilla will be named ‘Queen Consort’ on Charles’s ascension.There would have to be a change in the law in Britain and several other realms before Charles becomes king for her not to be. There is little or no appetite for that.To alter her status would be a PR own goal, like insisting a president’s wife should not be allowed the role and title of ‘First Lady’ — especially when the Government plans to use the royals to bolster our status on the world stage.The Duchess, 71 at the time of writing, is said to have told friends previously that she would be ‘happy’ to use the lesser title when her husband ascends to the throne.The title issue will be decided in the court of public opinion and by the Prime Minister at the time.Clarence House has always claimed that the constitutional issue surrounding the title would be ‘a matter for the government of the day’.However, all previous wives of British kings have been known as queens.Camilla has assuaged Charles’s loneliness, but knows when to leave him alone.When on the public stage, their togetherness makes them a redoubtable couple.He is the most prepared heir to the throne the country has ever had — wise, funny, intelligent and connected to his people in so many ways.She rarely puts a foot wrong on tour while representing the Queen or when supporting her husband. The Queen acknowledged this in 2012 when she awarded her daughter-in-law her highest personal honour, Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince Charles.Camilla has earned her stripes through the love and loyalty she has shown to her husband and by devotion to duty to the Crown.She will, I am told, be deservedly given the correct rank when the time comes. Charles will rightly insist on it. ADAPTED from Charles At Seventy: Thoughts, Hopes And Dreams by Robert Jobson, published by John Blake on November 1 at £20. © Robert Jobson 2018.To order a copy for £16 (offer valid until November 4, 2018 P\u0026ampP free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.How he will be defender of the faith   Queen Elizabeth II, as we all know, is a devout High Church Anglican. Charles, on the other hand, has taken a great interest in other religions, studying both the Koran and Judaism in depth.In 1993, for instance, he said: ‘Islam can teach us today a way of understanding and living in the world which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost.’This was widely quoted as proof that he had abandoned Christianity, though he remains a practising Anglican. Clearly, however, our next Supreme Governor of the Church of England plans to do the job a little differently.‘He is an inidual who wants to chart new territory, and that will be very interesting indeed,’ says Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. ‘He is very outspoken.’The Prince certainly caused a furore when he told Jonathan Dimbleby that he wants to be seen as a ‘Defender of Faith’ when he ascends the throne, rather than ‘Defender of the Faith’.Since then, Charles’s position on the wording to be used at his coronation has categorically changed. It has been made clear to me that Charles will ‘absolutely 100 per cent’ be named as ‘Defender of the Faith’ when he is crowned king.But he will also demonstrate in his reign that he believes wholeheartedly in the importance of his connecting with all faiths of the subjects he will reign over.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/02/51D07DD900000578-6335433-image-a-27_1540951285390.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles reaction spots Instagrammer used follow New Zealand","story":"Take on the trench coat like Meghan wearing BurberryShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex has already proven her versatility when it comes fashion during the royal tour.

But as this wipes out half of the gain for higher earners, he should have come clean and mentioned this in the Budget speech rather than leave it in the Budget small print.’However a rise in the basic rate income tax threshold to £12,500, which gives a £130 saving, will still leave top earners with a total reduction to their tax bill worth £495.The Conservative Party had pledged to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and the higher-rate threshold to £50,000 by 2020. But these increases will now come into effect 12 months ahead of schedule at the start of the next tax year on April 6, 2019.The £4bn stamp duty farce: That’s how much higher rate has...Hammond\u0027s raid on Scots: Stealth hike to National Insurance...Labour revolt after John McDonnell says he WON\u0027T try to...Share this articleCritics have claimed the change benefits the wealthy more than the worse-off. But Mr Hammond told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, adding: ‘It’s important to raise all of these thresholds. We promised to do so and we have done it.’Experts had feared Mr Hammond would be forced to renege on his promise to increase income tax thresholds in a bid to cover the cost of the £20billion funding pledge to the NHS. But speaking later on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Hammond said: ‘When you make a promise to the electorate and they elect you then you have an obligation to deliver on that promise.’The Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday said the Conservatives had pulled almost a million people into the higher tax bracket in the past eight years.

Her father was a member of the Holy See police force.Rome police will be looking in particular at whether the bones are a DNA match for Emanuela Orlandi or Mirella Gregori, both of whom were aged 15 when they went missing separately in Rome within the space of 40 days in 1983.Bombshell book claims Vatican priests had sex with boys...\u0027Lured to her death by Vatican cardinal paedophile ring or...Was this girl murdered after being snatched for Vatican sex...Missing girl \u0027buried in murdered mobster\u0027s tomb was...Share this articleThe disappearance has been linked to Cold War power struggles, the attempted murder of a pope, Vatican connections to Mob money-laundering, a mobster\u0027s tomb in a prestigious Catholic church and claims of satanic orgies by prelates.Shortly after she disappeared - she was last seen on a Rome street - the police received anonymous calls, which said Emanuela would be freed if Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who tried to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981, was released.  Agca was eventually released in 2010.Another theory suggested that Emanuela had been abducted at the behest of American archbishop, Paul Marcinkus, a former president of the Vatican bank who was linked to a major scandal and died in 2006.  Protesters in St Peter\u0027s Square, in the Vatican hold posters with Emanuela Orlandi\u0027s image calling for \u0027truth and justice for Emanuela Orlandi\u0027, during then-Pope Benedict\u0027s Regina Coeli prayer in May 2012. Emanuela Orlandi (left) was thedaughter of a Vatican employee, whose June 1983 disappearance has been linked to anything from Cold War rivalries to an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul IIThe last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Emanuela\u0027s remains too. However, that search turned up no link.More recently, a leading Italian investigative journalist caused a sensation when he published a five-page document last year that had been stolen from a locked Vatican cabinet that suggested the Holy See had been involved in Orlandi\u0027s disappearance. The Vatican immediately branded the document a fake, though it never explained what it was doing in the Vatican cabinet.The document was purportedly written by a cardinal and listed supposed expenses used for Orlandi\u0027s upkeep after she disappeared. The Vatican has repeatedly maintained that it has co-operated fully with police investigating the Orlandi case."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/15/4FD3DF3C00000578-0-image-a-33_1536329043258.jpg","title":"Jealous lover slashed face innocent woman wrongly suspected sleeping boyfriend","story":"    Wilkinson slashed her victim\u0027s face because she believed her to be sleeping with her boyfriend A jealous blonde who slashed the face of a woman she wrongly suspected of sleeping with her boyfriend has been jailed for six years.Nicole Wilkinson, 39, who publicly boasted of being \u0027Your worst nightmare wrapped in a bow\u0027, ambushed Yvonne Gelder on her own doorstep in the belief the victim was having an illicit affair.Miss Gelder, 36, answered the door to Wilkinson only for the attacker to lunge at her with a knife traditionally used by sommeliers to open bottles of wine.Wilkinson left the victim with a long cut to the face and two stab wounds to the chest before being pulled away by neighbours.Miss Gelder fled for her life on a bicycle but collapsed further up the street. She later had to be treated in hospital for serious injuries including a collapsed lung and a zig-zag cut down her left breast.Wilkinson of Lancaster was arrested later on suspicion of attempted murder but claimed the victim had come at her with the blade.At Preston Crown Court, she admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after she initially denied wrongdoing. She made her boast of being \u0027your worst nightmare\u0027 on her Facebook status in which she added: \u0027If it wasn\u0027t for bull****, no-one in this town would have a conversation.\u0027The 7pm incident occurred on August 17 this year after Wilkinson suspected her partner had been having a fling with Miss Gelder.Mr Frances McEntee prosecuting, said: \u0027The case has a background which is long-standing. The defendant believed Miss Gelder was having a relationship with her partner.\u0027The complainant says that she heard banging on the door and she knew it would be the defendant because of their past difficulties. \u0027She opened her front door and immediately saw the defendant with her hand clenched and she was holding what the defendant described as a Swiss-Army knife.\u0027The complainant said what are you doing, you crazy b****? and the defendant is then said to have lunged at her with the knife. The complainant felt a number of blows to the face and body.

The complainant was then top of the defendant, who still had hold of the knife.\u0027The defendant was then dragged away from the complainant. On lookers said that the complainant was bleeding heavily at this point. The complainant went back into the house and then set off on her bicycle while still bleeding heavily. A delivery man saw her pass out on the floor.\u0027She was immediately taken to the hospital and she had sustained some serious injuries. She sustained a number of cuts. Down the left side of her face, there is a long superficial cut.          The attacker admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at Preston Crown Court \u0027There\u0027s a puncture wound to her chest which has caused a zig-zag cut down the complainant\u0027s left breast. There is an injury to the underneath of her arm which is believed to have caused Pnuemothorax.\u0027This was a sustained assault with repeated blows delivered by a knife. It appears to be a Sommeliers knife, similar to a Swiss Army knife.\u0027When the defendant was arrested, her account was that the complainant had come at her with a knife. When the defendant was interviewed, she provided a statement which said that Yvonne Gelder came at her with a knife, but made no comment throughout.\u0027This is a high culpability offence because of the use of a knife and the puncture of the chest.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Christopher Evans, said: \u0027There were various falling outs and she is remorseful with what happened - the remorse is complete, it\u0027s extensive and it\u0027s genuine. She had a difficult childhood, particularly in her teenage years.\u0027But sentencing Judge Andrew Woolman told Wilkinsond: \u0027Make no mistake, this could have been a lot worse - the consequences could have been fatal.\u0027You have long-standing problems with the victim, maybe to do with your suspicions that she was having sexual relations with your partner. On August 17, you went to the complainant\u0027s house with what I suspect was the first sharp object you found, which was this Swiss Army Knife.\u0027You banged on the door and when she answered, you attacked her with it. She sustained injuries to her head and body and, fortunately, the slash on her face appeared to miss her eye.\u0027There were a number of other wounds one to her chest and one to the side of her chest which has caused Pnuemothorax which could have been fatal. Initially, you tried to say that she attacked you, which wasn\u0027t true, but you did plead guilty on the second occasion.\u0027I have read your letter, which is thoughtful and articulate and I accept that you say you are remorseful.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Austria joins Hungary backing migration pact","story":"    Austria\u0027s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, Austrian Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache and Austrian President Alexander Van Der Bellen.

This correspondence, edited by James Booth, reveals a new side of Larkin, as he tries to make up for how much he hated visiting his mother“My very dear old creature,” Larkin wrote to his mother Eva in August 1968, “a man has just presented me with a copy of The Letters of Wilfred Owen … Most of his letters are to his mother! The book is 629pp long. He starts his letters ‘Sweet my Mother’, which takes some living up to. I like mine better – my beginnings, I mean. My mother too probably.”James Booth’s selection of Larkin’s letters home, most of them written to his mother, is 688 pages long. “Dear Mop,” the early ones begin – he addressed his father, Sydney, as “Pop” but “Mop” also evoked Eva’s role as domestic drudge. His letters include drawings of her as a seal-like creature, often wearing a servant’s mob cap. After his father died in 1948, he began addressing her differently, as “My Dear Mop-Monst-Haugh” or “Dear creaturely one” or, most often, “My dear old creature”. The drawings are sweetly affectionate and the letters never less than dutiful the burden of looking after their widowed mother fell mostly on his sister, Catherine, but Larkin wrote to her every weekend, visited regularly and, while working at Leicester University in the late 1940s, lived with her for two years. With a library to run and literary ambitions to pursue, he couldn’t have done much more. Still, the subtext of the letters is guilt: he spent so little time with her and couldn’t help her feel less lonely.The guilt came out as exasperation and rage. The day before that letter to Eva about Owen, for instance, he wrote to his lover Monica Jones about how, once home, “I become snappy, ungrateful, ungracious, wounding, inconsiderate \u0026amp even abusive, longing only to get away, muttering obscenities because I know she can’t hear them, refusing to speak clearly so that she can hear, refusing to make conversation or evince any interest in her ‘news’ or things she has to say.” He knows what underlies this – “my anger is a fight for emotional freedom against the enemy” – but the violence of his feelings bemuses him nonetheless: “Sometimes I wonder if I’m fond of my mother at all.”For three decades, from his mid-20s to his mid-50s, until she died aged 91, he spent his letters trying to cheer her up and to suppress any filial unfondness. A few letters take the form of apologies, after a temper loss at home or over the phone. Otherwise, they are warm, chatty and anodyne, with a focus on matters he thinks will interest Eva, not literary gossip, malicious jokes or metaphysics, but the weather, meals, domestic chores (“Did I tell you that last Sunday I cleaned the gas cooker?”), work, holidays, his hay fever, his melancholy (“clay-cold depression” was something he knew about, too). He tells her how much he weighs, how badly he’s done on the football pools, how hostile he feels towards immigrants and what clothes he’s wearing, especially his choice of socks – to darn or not to darn, he asks, knowing she’ll have the answer. Occasionally they discuss his poems (extracts from Eva’s letters appear as footnotes) but there is little of what makes his letters to friends and lovers so rewarding: the jokes, anger, obscenities, agonies and so on.The preponderance of banal quotidian detail perhaps explains why Anthony Thwaite included none of Larkin’s letters to his family in his 1992 selection. Even fans who thought they could never get enough of Larkin may struggle to get through more than 600 pages of “I hope your sciatica has gone”, “I had the pleasure of finding the cheque the laundry sent me for that shirt they lost” or “Snow here today! Not very deep though”. A sample of index entries for Eva runs: “out-of-date tins of salmon … neighbour’s dog … new electric fire, cistern and immersion heater … light and heater in outside lavatory … pedal bin”. Here is such stuff as tedium is made of. And yet the book is well worth having because we see a side of Larkin little glimpsed until now: not the friend and lover but the determinedly loyal, long-suffering son. Eva may have fucked him up, but he can’t hold that against her, since she was fucked up in her turn. Larkin’s sense of “dooty” towards his mother was one of the reasons he remained single. If they married, he told Monica, there might be pressure for his mother to move in with them – a terrible prospect given her “whining panicky grumbling maddening manner”. What he’d seen of his parents’ marriage was discouraging: better gloomy isolation than marital boredom. “I think the impulse of loneliness in everyone is stronger than the impulse of love or ‘cosiness’,” he told Eva at the age of 22. He fell in love several times but his entanglements with Jones, Maeve Brennan and Betty Mackereth weren’t something to be shared with his mother. No other woman could ever dislodge her from being The One, or so he pretended. “We must go again up that road to the wood where we found the scarlet toadstool and listen to the wind in the trees,” he wrote to her from Belfast (where he spent five years), as if to a lover or muse.He was rarely this lyrical with Eva. As Booth says in his introduction, she brought out the prosaic and commonplace in him, and even at his most philosophical his imagery tends to be homespun: “Every day comes to us like a newly cellophaned present, a chance for an entirely fresh start,” he writes at one point, in another vain attempt to lift her spirits. But she did inspire a handful of his finest poems. When they discussed them, he had to downplay, indeed lie about, any suggestion of negativity. The room at home he talks about in his poem “Reference Back” is described as “unsatisfactory” only “in so far as it really isn’t my permanent room”, he explains. As for the line “Home is so sad”, he was “quite honestly thinking of my room in Belfast”. Well, maybe, except that he once told Jones, after a typically gloomy Christmas with Eva, “I don’t like home \u0026amp never have.”Other letters here disclose the origins of the poems he’s best known for. A letter to Eva in late April 1955 talks of him sitting “with cotton wool stuffed in my ears” to drown out the noise of the radio downstairs. The poem “Mr Bleaney”, in which he describes “stuffing my ears with cotton-wool, to drown  the jabbering set” below, was completed the following month. Larkin was living in Cottingley, Bradford, at the time, having just taken up his post as librarian at the University of Hull. If those on the appointments panel had read the poem he’d just published in a Hull magazine, he told Eva, they’d surely have turned him down: “Why should I let the toad work  Squat on my life?” wasn’t the wisest of bids for salaried employment.Whereas grumbles about work are a common feature of the letters, there’s a telling lack of reference to Sydney after his death aged 63 (as if silence on the matter might diminish Eva’s grief) and of the ECT she received during a month’s spell in a psychiatric hospital. Eva was a woman consumed by fears: of thunder, cows, dogs, planes, being out after dark. Larkin hoped against hope that she’d become more settled but she remained a creature of panic, trapped in what he called a “prison of misery”. In later years, she moved into a nursing home, but knowing she’d be cared for brought him little relief: “My mother, not content with being motionless, deaf and speechless, is now going blind,” he wrote to Kingsley Amis in 1977. “That’s what you get for not dying, you see.” Within a month she was dead. But Larkin’s new-found freedom was brief he outlived her only by eight years.The earliest letters here – from the late 1930s and 40s – give little hint of the tribulations to come. Addressed to Sydney as well as Eva, they are lively and larky, with accounts of books he’s reading, Oxford, his first job and various writers he has met, among them Dylan Thomas, George Orwell and EM Forster (“a toothy little aged Billy Bunter”). DH Lawrence is his idol: one of the few comic letters here describes the difficulties he has, at the Bodleian Library, in persuading “an unpleasant girl with spectacles – with a face as read as a peony” to allow him to read Lady Chatterley’s Lover. Ambitious to become a writer himself (“writing is the only thing I shall ever take seriously enough to give my whole attention and energies to”), he finishes two novels in two years while working as a librarian in Wellington during the war. The war itself goes largely unmentioned, except when Coventry was bombed and he worried what had become of his family.Among these early letters are several addressed to Catherine, full of an affection that sometimes deserted him once wrangles began over caring for their widowed mother (he would later describe her as his “bitch-sister … an absolutely mean-spirited self-centred little swine of Hell”). Whereas Sydney brings out the intellectual in him, and Eva the homebody, the artistic Catherine – 10 years his senior – has him testing out his powers of description: “the sky is blue, slim clouds tinged salmon by the low sun”, “smoke drifts away on the ruffling wind”. It seems his efforts weren’t appreciated: when he sent her some of his verse, she acknowledged it grumpily: “I feel miserable enough without having poems like that come.” It may be no coincidence that few of the letters between them survived. But they were closer as siblings than he liked to pretend.In the end, though, it’s Eva who dominates this collection – and who dominated Larkin’s life. “I am what her savage loving has made me,” Beckett said about his mother. Eva’s love wasn’t savage but cloying. Larkin wrote to her out of pity and tenderness, knowing how proud of him she was and how much his letters meant to her. But the guilt never left him. “Have just found out that Arnold Bennett wrote to his mother every day!” he told Eva five years before she died, as if he could have done better.• Philip Larkin: Letters Home by Philip Larkin (Faber, £40).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment.

All 10 of the £30m-£50m apartments towards the top of the Shard have been empty since the tower was completed six years ago after its owners, led by the Qatari royal family, failed to achieve high enough offers.More than half of the 1,900 ultra-luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, adding to fears that the capital would be left with dozens of “posh ghost towers”. The swanky £1m-plus flats, complete with private gyms, swimming pools and cinema rooms, are lying empty as hundreds of thousands of would-be first-time buyers struggle to find an affordable home.It is not the first time that Centre Point has failed to find occupiers. When the tower was completed in 1966 it did not attract enough high-paying office tenants and remained vacant for a decade, leading to it to be nicknamed “London’s empty skyscraper”.Homelessness campaigners staged an occupation of the tower in 1974 to highlight the problem and the tower then lent its name to homelessness charity CentrePoint.“Now its happening all over again – Centre Point’s redevelopers have taken fright at Brexit jitters and decided many of its luxury apartments must remain empty again,” said Chris Bailey, campaign manager of charity Action on Empty Homes.The drop in confidence among buyers appears to have caught Almacantar by surprise as the tower’s development team were very confident that all of the flats would be snapped up in short order when they gave the  a tour of the tower this summer.Kathrin Hersel, Centre Point’s property director, said the duplex penthouse ning the 32nd and 33rd floors would sell itself. “There are plenty of people in the world who could afford it,” she said. That penthouse features five ensuite bathrooms and a wraparound terrace with a vista across all of London taking in St Paul’s Cathedral, Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and beyond to Surrey Hills on a good day.Almacantar had even sold one £5m two-bedroom  apartment to the parents of a Chinese student about to start studying at UCL.Hussey said Almacantar, which is part-owned by Italy’s billionaire Agnelli family, might relaunch sales after a Brexit deal had been agreed. “When buyers feel more confident about the wider macro situation, they will also feel more confident about paying these prices again,” he told the trade magazine Estates Gazette. Hussey declined to speak to the .Almacantar has told its estate agents at Knight Frank and CBRE to stand down. Mark Collins, chairman of CBRE, said: “Centre Point Residences is a beautifully executed project that we believe will have enduring appeal in the market.” He added they would be ready to try selling again next year when there was “a clear runway ahead”.Henry Pryor, an independent luxury property buying agent, said rich overseas buyers were very concerned about the risk of overpaying for central London properties particularly if the economy suffered in the wake of a disorderly Brexit or if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister and introduced a wealth tax.He said: “The wealthy are far more worried about the risk of a Corbyn-led government than even the hardest of Brexits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a2cb53ed5102a7770180f6bfcc3eb0334bb499/0_22_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5577639ff688c367b10882f9450b6e35","title":"markets stage rally month losses ftse dow business live","story":"All the latest economic and financial news, as spooked investors try to put ‘Red October’ behind themThe slump in Red October has dragged many global stock markets into negative territory for this year.Here’s a selection of the best and worst performers in 2018:But there’s still time for a turnaround.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says markets may be turning the corner, after a rough October:Asia markets managed to close out the month of October and post their second consecutive day of gains in what has been a pretty poor month for equity markets in general.This rebound could well be down to some end of month position adjusting, however there have been some indications in the past few days that we might be starting to see a bit of a short term base, with most of the bad news already priced in to some extent.American’s can’t get enough of Halloween, so Wall Street is eager to join today’s rally.Here’s the pre-market calls from CMC Markets:Nearly every sector is up, led by manufacturers, energy firms, tech stocks and banks:Here are the top risers on the Footsie this morningDespite today’s Halloween rally, global markets are still on track for their worst month since the financial crisis.Figures calculated earlier this week showed that $8 trillion had been wiped off global stocks in October.Trade wars, the slowdown in China, tensions in the eurozone and Brexit have all encouraged investors to ditch risky stocks.Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says:Smart money is running for the hill and this was the message which October brought for the global equity market. Global stocks lost over $8 trillion in October, a headline which suits the best on the Halloween day.Investors are refusing to be spooked on Halloween, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX:With October containing as much red as the goriest of slasher flicks, the markets oddly chose to rebound on what would have been an entirely calendar-appropriate day to continue the month’s trading horrors. Overnight, China got the shivers, as manufacturing activity fell and the yuan was fixed at a new 10-year low to the dollar.Today’s rally is welcome, but it’s not enough to wipe out this month’s losses.October has been particularly bad for US investors, with the main indices falling sharply.CNBC has crunched the numbers, and explains:After Tuesday’s comeback, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S\u0026ampP 500 is off by 7.9 percent in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. On Monday, the S\u0026ampP 500 closed in correction territory, down 10.2 percent from its record.“Obviously we’re in a correction phase of the stock market and I think investors have to realize that,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird.“The monetary environment has changed. As you can see, even with a 10 percent change in the stock markets, interest rates have barely moved lower.”European stocks are all jumping - fortunately not with fright.Weeeee! The FTSE 100 is flying faster than a rocket.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business.It’s Halloween - a dark time of ritual, dressing-up, and trick-or-treating. But any children touring the City of London must make a special effort to scare investors they’re well used to shocks and scares this month.Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says there is fear on the trading floors:October has well and truly lived up to its chilling reputation, with stock markets around the globe suffering one of their worst months in recent memory. It’s been a wild ride for investors and there is no guarantee it’s over yet.Markets may have recovered their early losses and some indices may even be in the green for the week but volatility has not eased and that’s a concern.But after a month of gory red, things might be turning.Thea main European markets are also up in early trading. There are still reasons to hide under the bedsheets, though. Yesterday, we learned that eurozone growth has halved. Later today we get fresh unemployment and inflation figures for the eurozone. David Madden of CMC Markets says this data could set the mood for the day, and beyond:Matteo Salvini, Italy’s joint deputy prime minister claimed the underwhelming update is a reason the government needs to increase spending, and in turn increase the budget deficit. The Italian situation could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis, and given that the country has the third-largest government bond market in the world, the fallout could be enormous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccbbe13f721df860ad4b8df19edc28dd20784ff3/0_53_2256_1353/master/2256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3a5a2145faaa14a7767d00a2c2a16ec","title":"new 50p brexit british coins europe","story":"This won’t be the first time a British coin has celebrated a schism with the rest of Europe“Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”: what a curious motto for the new 50p coin that the Treasury has announced will commemorate Britain’s exit from the European Union. It has an air of playground desperation about it – the neediness of a kid who, having wilfully pissed off all 27 of his friends, is slinking nervously back into the schoolyard looking for someone – anyone – to play with.It will not be the first time that Britain’s relationship with Europe has been marked on its coinage. Commemorative 50p pieces were struck in 1973 when Britain joined the European Economic Community, and in 1998 to mark the UK’s presidency of the EU. But you could argue that the neatest parallel to the Brexit coin goes back almost two millennia, to the third century AD and the first, dramatic Brexit – under Britain’s breakaway Roman emperor, Carausius.A Roman officer from modern Netherlands, Carausius was given command of a fleet whose job was to rid the Channel of Saxon raiders. But, accused of colluding with the pirates, he was sentenced to death. His response, in about AD 286 or 287, was to seize control of the Roman province of Britannia, along with a chunk of France around Boulogne.Precisely what was really going on here is hard to unpick there is hardly anything to go on in the historical record (a fact that probably helped rather than hindered the writer Rosemary Sutcliff in fleshing out a wonderfully compelling account in her children’s book The Silver Branch). But there are strong clues in the distinctive, highly suggestive coins Carausius struck. One declared him “the restorer of Britain”, another “spirit of Britain”. Another was inscribed with words that translate as “Come, awaited one” – an adaptation of a phrase from Virgil. Another had an image of Romulus and Remus suckled by the she-wolf – the great, resonant image of Rome’s mythical origins – with the inscription, “the restorer of the Romans”, along with the rather enigmatic initials RSR. Carausius was claiming to hark back to a better, stronger age.For years no one had a clue what the letters RSR or INPCDA alluded to. Then, in 1997, it suddenly occurred to the writer and broadcaster Guy de la Bédoyère – while running a bath for his children – that they could perhaps be something to do with Virgil. On the offchance, he flicked through the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. And there the letters were, right in front of him. RSR stands for redeunt saturnia regna, or “the Golden Age returns” INPCDA for iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto – “now a new progeny is sent from heaven”. Together, they are the most famous line and a half of Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue – an ecstatic poem foretelling the start of a glorious new era.Carausius’s “Brexit” coins, then, can plausibly be seen as a claim that he will preside over the rebirth of Britain – coupled with a bold, not to say shameless, assertion of legitimacy. (By pure chance, until the round British pound coin was replaced with a dodecagonal version last year, it also had a quotation from Virgil inscribed on its rim – decus et tutamen, meaning ornament and protection, which comes from the Aeneid.)It strikes me that the leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson, for one, might like nothing better than to have himself minted on to a coin wearing a toga and surrounded by quotations from Virgil announcing him the harbinger of a new golden age. But the rest of the story might put leavers off a bit. In around 293 Carausius was assassinated by a shadowy figure called Allectus, who assumed control of Britannia. And then, in 296, the general Constantinus Chlorus arrived with troops and brought the province back into the empire (he was the father of Constantine the Great, proclaimed emperor in York a decade later). Britain’s first Brexit, as far as we can tell, was a short-lived and unhappy affair – whatever the coins might have claimed.• Charlotte Higgins is the ’s chief culture writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b92fed7dc8b4d59d02bd17a19f0f373882fa2e70/0_0_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa8bbee9b6538e8be0aa2e1676884b88","title":"halloween is supposed to be spooky but its just confusing","story":"From the timings to the costumes, the festival’s protocol puzzles me. We need a nationwide consensusEvery year I’m puzzled by the protocol of Halloween. For a two-week period near the end of October, I find myself asking “Is it now?”. I mean, yes, the calendar says 31 October, but on which night adults dress up, or the kids dress up, or when either group is coming to my house, is anyone’s guess.Last Saturday, I saw a woman walking the streets dressed as the chef from Ratatouille with a tiny rat on her shoulder. Top marks. Loved it. It was also a snappy reminder that I needed to buy something to throw, underarm, into children’s pillowcases. I went out and bought a pre-apocalypse-sized bag of Haribo, thinking some kids, yet to get type 2 diabetes, would, that night, be screaming “TRICK OR TREAT???!!!!” way too close to my face. Unfortunately, the scariest thing that happened was I worked my way through the entire bag without so much as a buzz on the doorbell. But good for my dentist, who will be able to get that bathroom renovation he has been so desperate for.So, are the pint-sized spectres coming tonight, then? Are they coming at all? If so, we need to make this decisive – tonight only, and with no deviation. And clearer dress codes! Why are you dressing as a nurse that you have confusing downstairs feelings about? The origins of Halloween are in the Celtic pagan festival Samhain, when the boundary between the two worlds thinned. That’s why it’s supposed to be a bit s-s-s-poooky. There’s nothing scary about a Pixar chef that can’t cook who has a rat companion with a tiny hat. If anything, it’s adorable.What we need is a national consensus, a referendum on Halloween: are we in or are we out? Hopefully, the outcome will be a bit more clear cut this time.Any PR person worth their salt will tell you that you should sell merchandise at a bad gig, no matter how terrible you are on stage, because the fans will still buy it. Which leads me to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and his heroic announcement of a commemorative 50p coin to mark Brexit. You know Brexit, that thing that hasn’t happened yet? As far as gigs go, it’s the worst show in town. But the big PH is forging ahead, literally waving shiny things at the British public to distract it from the negotiations that can’t be negotiated and the deal that can’t be dealt.

In theory, at least, the commemorations should be a time to unify the nation in a way that next year’s 30th anniversary of the negotiated fall of communism in 1989 – the nature of which continues to ide Polish society – cannot.But Poles are not so easily reconciled. Behind the flag-waving and patriotic banalities stands a ided and unhappy country. Throughout the 19th century and again throughout the communist period, many Poles yearned not just for their own independent state but for that state to fulfil the nation’s imagined destiny as an integral part of the west. But what did “the west” mean?For many, including successive generations of Polish leaders after 1989, this meant anchoring the country in western political and security institutions and adopting the liberal democratic values that underpinned them. But others, who regard godless liberal rationalism as little more than a variant of Soviet social engineering, harboured the delusion that the west represented a kind of pre-Enlightenment medieval Christendom. As they have become disabused of this fantasy, so many are creeping towards the conclusion that they are stuck within a value system they do not believe in. Membership of the European Union meant money and respect, but little attention was given to the nature of the transformation of the Polish economy and society – and the ensuing obligations – that would accompany it.In retrospect, it seems a miracle that liberal democracy took hold in Poland in recent decades in the way that it did. Contrary to national myth, which often confuses the long-held desire for national liberation with a genuine collective commitment to democratic values, the democratic tradition was never very deeply embedded in Polish society. Liberal democratic values in Poland have long had to contend not only with the legacy of communism but also with that of a peculiarly Polish brand of national Catholicism that shares with communism a commitment to hierarchy, dogma and ritual, and the associated authoritarian vices of ignorance, passivity and paranoia that have come to the fore in recent years.To see the dramatic shift in Polish attitudes towards the west, one needs only to look at the young. For those of a certain age, Poland’s hard border with the west before EU accession had immense symbolic power. It suggested that Poles were not yet to be trusted, that they were not yet to be considered as equals. The opening of its western borders in 2004 represented not just liberation and convenience, but also acceptance and respect. But for many younger Poles who have since left the country looking for work, Europe’s open borders have come to represent the collusion of Polish and European elites in the economic exploitation of the young. As a result, many have rejected liberalism and democracy and instead been drawn towards nationalism and the narratives of the far right.As the Polish government’s present confrontation with European institutions shows, however, this new authoritarian order cannot be fully implemented as long as Poland remains in the EU. Not only does EU law not allow for the kind of authoritarianism that some in Poland want, but allowing such a direct and sustained challenge to the authority of that law threatens its very existence.For some Europeans, the fact that the Polish crisis has reached this point constitutes proof that the country should never have been allowed to join the EU in the first place. This is deeply unfair – Poland should be judged on the achievements of the last 30 years, not the events of the last three. But it does serve as a reminder that it was never Poland’s “destiny” to be so deeply embedded in the west. It was a choice, and it is a choice that must be renewed by each successive generation if it is to be sustained. As the British are finding out at the moment, the decision to pursue a European future can be “unmade” more easily than you think.As a result, the question of Poland’s long-term future – something that had long been thought to have been settled – will hang heavy over this year’s independence festivities. For many Poles there is something deeply, deeply maddening and shaming about the possibility that after centuries of struggle, culminating in the victory and international admiration of 1989 and accession to the EU 15 years later, their nation could have achieved so much, and yet proceed to throw it all away again in a fit of pique – the final confirmation of warnings from their ancestors that beneath the patriotic bombast, Poles will always be their own worst enemy.But one cannot dismiss the possibility that this maddening and charismatic nation is still capable of unexpected and formidable acts of resistance. The emotion, the hypocrisy, the cynicism, the sense of bewilderment and frustration, the ability to rise up in anger one moment and to remain stubbornly passive the next – these are all inherent to the Polish soap opera.For that reason, to be Polish – even only in part, as I am – is a kind of agony. Dragging you into its drama, it is a nation that never fails to give you hope, even as it lets you down. As I rage against it, I cannot escape the feeling that I am condemned to love it forever.• Christian Davies is a journalist based in Warsaw"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e52cdfab16492b440ef7f1704d59c97ac4e092/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c78ad8ce5095b43f1aeb58718cb701d","title":"st marys university in london to stop making unconditional offers","story":"St Mary’s University will no longer offer students places irrespective of A-level gradesA university in London has banned the controversial practice of offering prospective students unconditional places in a move designed to “maintain standards”.St Mary’s University in Twickenham announced the plan after admitting that a number of students who had been given unconditional offers did not go on to achieve their expected grades.Such offers, which were given to almost a quarter of students in this year’s cohort, allow students to accept an undergraduate place without meeting their A-level or BTech grades predicted by teachers.They are seen as an attempt to fill course places irrespective of academic requirements. Post-exam admissions are seen as better gauge of academic standards and more likely to benefit students from disadvantaged backgrounds.The universities minister Sam Gyimah has described the rise in unconditional offers as irresponsible, and said that handing them out to put “bums on seats” undermined the credibility of the university system.In a tweet he congratulated St Mary’s for “standing up for quality and standards in our higher education system”.John Brewer, pro vice-chancellor for St Mary’s, said the institution was “determined to maintain standards of entry” and had decided to withdraw unconditional offers for 201819.Announcing the move, he said: “It was clear to us that a number of students who enrolled with us after an unconditional offer was made didn’t meet the grades they expected and this didn’t merit the investment we made into that particular part of our recruitment programme.”He added: “By listening to the views of schools, teachers, our own staff and students, we believe that with the evidence that has been available to us that we’ve made the right decision.”Nearly 70,000 unconditional offers were made to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2018, up from less than 3,000 five years ago.When those figures were released in July, Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust educational charity, told the  that grade predictions were often the least reliable.“Having actual grades on application empowers the student.

It will be open daily from 8am to 10pm “for the foreseeable future”. Anyone unable to visit the King Power can leave a message in an online tribute via the club’s website.Investigations into the cause of the accident are continuing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e946a544f04d7c839290b2274ce46015a70d0a5/0_253_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a442f72938e4014d5b95b56bb0951ee","title":"there is no need for women to work afghan tv show takes on patriarchy","story":"Inspired by hit US series Ugly Betty, Roya follows the fortunes of a 20-year-old, single, educated woman and her challenges joining the workforce in post-Taliban KabulRoya wants to take a job in a local media company, but her father and brother aren’t keen. “What is the need for a young girl to work outside?” asks her father, seated on a toushak, the traditional Afghan low-seating cushions, sipping the customary post-dinner chai. Her brother chimes in with an answer. “There is no need for women to work,” he says.And so begins the pilot episode of a series that is set to air on prime-time Afghan television in November. The show, named after its central character, Roya, follows the life of the single, 20-year-old, educated woman in a post-Taliban Kabul, and that of her family – parents, two younger sisters and a brother. Inspired by the US hit show Ugly Betty, the series takes a lighter, and more humorous approach to some of the pressing challenges women face in Afghanistan. Its central message is that women should get out of the home and join the workforce.Roya is the first woman in her family to seek employment. However, the challenges she faces go beyond having to convince her family to let her work. Roya’s experiences and interactions are often awkward, and complicated by characters who aren’t accustomed to being around working women.“The story, infused with humour, traces Roya’s journey as much as that of the other characters who get to evolve and grow from the experiences of working alongside women,” says Masooma Ibrahimi, the show’s scriptwriter. “Over the course of 10 episodes, she encounters a variety of characters. Some are supportive and helpful, while others are negative and do not approve of the idea of women in offices,” she adds.The show is funded by USAid’s Promote project that seeks to improve women’s lives, and produced by Kabul-based Rumi Consultancy.Although loosely based on the concept behind the US sitcom, Roya travels in a different direction. “While the Ugly Betty premise is that she is just an awkward girl, in this programme it shifts to the main character being one of those Afghan girls who is the first in her family to enter the workforce,” explains Mina Sharifi, project lead with Rumi Consultancy. “In Afghanistan, especially in Kabul, there are so many girls like that. Being that first girl – as a sister, or a daughter – to make that shift, that’s where the stories come from.”Before writing the first draft of the script, the all-Afghan production team – the majority of whom are female – interviewed several working Afghan women to document their experiences, challenges and triumphs, to make the characters relatable.“Right from the awkwardness of working with men, dealing with social pressure, and navigating the environment of an office in Afghanistan, these stories have happened to someone,” says Ibrahimi.Lima Nawabzada, a 23-year-old production manager at Rumi Consultancy, was moved to tears when she saw the first episode. She saw herself in Roya, when the character takes her mother along with her for a job interview. “My mother and brother also accompanied me to the interview and to check the office environment,” she recalls, adding that the show accurately reflects the real problems of working women in her country. “I know a lot of girls who, like me, get uncomfortable working in a room full of boys who might not always be supportive,” she says.Sharif adds: “A lot of thought was put into the characters to make sure they were balanced. While there are characters who support Roya, there is also one who is openly against working women. There’s another girl who’s defying her fiance who doesn’t want her to work, and there’s also a man in the show who stalks Roya via texts, making references to workplace harassment, an increasingly common issue Afghan women face.”“We are hopeful that this show can help change the overall narratives of working women in popular culture in Afghanistan,” Ibrahimi says. “Sure we still have some radicals in Afghanistan, but as part of the media it is our responsibility to inform and educate the public. If we can influence just one person we have made a worthy impact.”So what about Roya’s job? She does manage to convince her father to let her work and eventually becomes the main breadwinner for her family, and slowly changes the dynamics within it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58eca0c36f70c545928cd37e6667d16355a3b5e1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bd1efe4647317bf83b517b91458171a","title":"ghosting busters why tech companies trying stop blanking each other","story":"We’ve all had to deal with the person who starts a friendly chat then just … vanishes. Dating apps, Facebook and Google think they have the answers. But why do they care?This Halloween, ghosts aren’t welcome. Two dating apps have announced plans to use the season to crack down on the rudest of social media villains, the ghoster: the person who enthusiastically replies to your messages, starts a friendly chat and then, one day, just … stops.Earlier this week, Bumble, the woman-friendly dating service, announced it had created the post of “ghosting specialist”, bringing the journalist and author Kate Leaver in to hear confessions, dispense advice and be a shoulder to cry on for those whose attempts to find love ended with messages echoing in the void.Another dating service, Badoo, has gone one step further, announcing plans to prompt would-be ghosts to reply to their ghostees, with a series of suggested responses, such as: “Hey, sorry for the late reply. When are you free to meet?” or “Hey, I think you’re great, but I don’t see us as a match. Take care!”They may be seasonally appropriate, but it’s hard not to view the proposals with an air of cynicism. After all, the last thing a dating app wants is its users giving up on dating – or, God forbid, continuing to date, but without using dating apps.Leaver insists such suspicions are misplaced. Her role, building on the expertise she developed writing her book The Friendship Cure, is firmly focused on pushing for “a revival of kindness and respect”, she says. “There are a lot of broken hearts and confused people these days. People are ghosting everyone all over the place.“I think people are too frightened, or too lazy, or too cowardly to have the difficult conversations that need to be had,” Leaver adds. “There has been some pretty extreme psychological damage for people who are living without any explanation as to why they’ve been ghosted because we tend to fill in the silence with our own insecurity.”Badoo emphasises the positives of its app’s feature: “Badoo has 60 million monthly active users. The feature itself simply intercepts the ‘ghosting’ process by encouraging users to reply. It also prompts those who are actually interested in their match to get the ball rolling and meet in real life.”Cynical or not, dating apps are only the latest companies to nudge users to participate more, under the guise of helping them “connect” with each other. Google, for instance, recently updated Gmail to introduce a feature called “nudges”. The service, which is on by default, prompts users to reply to emails that they “might have forgotten to respond to” and to “follow up” on emails they sent that never received a reply.While it can occasionally be useful (who among us hasn’t closed a message intending to reply to it in five minutes, only to leave it for five days?), the feature is attempting to fight a symptom of information overload by simply adding more information to the pile. It’s not enough to ignore an email. We now have to ignore it twice. In the meantime, the message is there , in bright orange, reminding you that it was “received five days ago. Reply?”Then, when you do click to reply, there are yet more nudges, from Google’s “smart compose” and “smart reply” features. The company is so eager to get users to communicate that it is now more than capable of hosting a conversation with neither person participating at all – just an endless stream of algorithmically composed “Thanks!”, “OK then!”, “See you later!” and “Ha ha, yes!” going back and forth, until one or both crack and resort to actually typing.Could nudging ghosters in the dating world simply add to the overload of the modern era? After all, as the psychologist Maya Borgueta has written in HuffPost, “ghosting is avoidance and often stems from fear of conflict. Which means that, at its heart, ghosting is about wanting to avoid confrontation, avoid difficult conversations and avoid hurting someone’s feelings.”If that is the case, Badoo’s pushy attempts to restart conversations could have the opposite effect to that intended: if you ghost because of a fear of confrontation, then it’s not much help when your dating app begins confronting you.At least Google’s nudges can be legitimately defended as productivity tools and Badoo’s as helping get the ball rolling on real dates – presumably the goal of everyone using a dating app. For the really thirsty nudges, you simply need to look at the largest social network of them all: Facebook.For a company with almost 2 billion users, an advertising platform that prints money, and no natural predator in sight, Facebook operates with an almost pathological paranoia. The company is constantly panicking about potential threats to its lead, switching wildly between various priorities for its apps, algorithms and users. First, video was the future, then live video, then groups and now “meaningful connections”.What that leads to in practice is bizarre inventions such as “Friends Day”, the anniversary of Facebook’s founding in February 2004, when the company tries to encourage users to post messages to each other. This year, that involved encouraging people to give each other “friend awards”, such as “my favourite weirdo” or “always has my back”.In the industry, these nudges have a name: “growth hacking”, sending little notifications to persuade users to open the app, boosting figures such as DAU (daily active users) just in time for the quarterly earnings calls. And they owe the intellectual framework to the behavioural economics school of nudge theory, which argues that mild changes in information presentation can have large effects on inidual behaviour.But there is a growing movement against such mild nudges. In theory, they allow governments and companies to shape behaviour for the better, while still preserving the freedom to opt out if the inidual so desires in practice, some argue, they are a far deeper attack on agency than simply forcing people to comply, as people who don’t know they’re being coerced are denied the freedom to object.Steven Ledbetter is the CEO of Habitry, which, yes, teaches companies how to apply “motivation science” to “make their products more engaging”. But, he argues, far too many people fail to treat users like human beings. “We think these bullshit behaviour-change technologies almost always have the feature of thinking human beings would just ‘be happier’ if we were more predictable. Had less autonomy. Were more like robots. Were easier to nudge.”By all means, take heed of Bumble’s campaign against ghosting and do your friends and lovers the courtesy of telling them when you are breaking up with them, even if you don’t have the courage to explain why. But next time you are about to sit down and write a message just because an app told you to, perhaps pause and wonder if being more like a robot is really how you want to live your life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d24cde1447db60bcada4ff343b90cca4f6d886c/0_414_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=679b5a82693bd76faffaa78827b35edf","title":"queer publishing lgbtq queer media niche","story":"For queer publishers, life can be tough: despite the corporate love of all things LGBTQ, there’s no money in itSomeone has queered the magazine shelves of McNally Jackson, the boujee bookstore in Soho, New York. The shelves are throbbing with thick, glossy, high production magazines with titles such as Butch, Cakeboy, Cave Homo, Gayletter, Headmaster, Posture and The Tenth. Queer publishing – at least on the surface – appears to be having a moment.With the same-sex marriage debate (mostly) over and trans rights now a mainstream topic, it seems like there is a shift in media. Even publishing giant Condé Nast is in on it, launching Them, “a next-generation community platform” that will tell its stories “through the lens of today’s LGBTQ community”. Grindr, the gay dating app, has Into, its own online magazine.But appearances can deceive. Life for independent publishers is tough, and perhaps even more so for queer ones. “Queer publishing has been bad,” says Cakeboy founder Sean Santiago over coffee in McNally’s cafe. “The upside is it’s really queer now – queer magazines put together by queer people,” he says. The downside is that for all the corporate love of all things LGBTQ, there’s no money in it. “On the one hand it’s great to be niche. On the other it sucks to be niche.”Cakeboy describes itself as a “breeding ground for disruptive faggotry”. The latest issue is eclectic to say the least. There’s a lengthy – and funny – interview with hot cultural critic Andrea Long Chu on the many, many problems with men, sex and identity. (Sample sentence: “Like, if you are a man, you should know that you’re a disease and that you really ought to transition.”) There’s fashion – queer fashion, obviously – interviews, reviews and a guide to ass scrubs. Previous issues have included helpful guides to taking the perfect dick pic.Queer publishers are on to something, and after years of stolid, safe offerings queer people are being offered publications that reflect their rainbow. The bad side is that “we build something. Then big corporations come in and take our ideas, our strategies and take all the money,” says Santiago.Hello Mr was in at the start of the new wave of queer mags, and Fitzgibbon has been a mentor to many newcomers. He says he was proud of what he had achieved and inspired. But running an independent magazine was not for the faint-hearted.The first, big, problem for independent publishers – and not just those in the LGBTQ community – is advertising. Take the latest issue of Cave Homo: 108 pages of high-gloss, queer culture featuring work by global art stars Ryan McGinley and David Wojnarowicz, among others. It also has features on out skateboard star Lacey Baker, sponsored by Nike. But don’t look for a Nike ad, or any other ads, for that matter. And not because of aesthetic considerations.The last issue cost about $20 a copy to make and sells for $40. Creator Luke Williams now has about $17,000 burning a hole in his credit cards and, though he wants to, is unsure whether he can really afford to get started on issue three.So why do it? Williams says it started in part as reaction to Trump’s election. “It helped me cope with the political climate,” he says. But he also said he wasn’t seeing himself reflected in the media – not even in gay media. A bear of a man, all he saw was the conventionally good-looking. And, he says, that’s what he continues to see outside the indie sphere. “Look at the people working for Them. They’re all gorgeous and 20. If you walked into an office and everyone there was a beautiful 20-year-old blond woman, you’d think something was wrong. What’s different with this?”Nor does the internet help much. While the web has given a platform to minority issues, its Silicon Valley masters heavily regulate what we are allowed to see. The algorithms say male breasts are fine, female breasts are not and, please, nothing below the waist. Tech has also removed their ability to make much money. Online cash is hard enough to come by even for major publishers. Facebook and Google took 63¢ of every ad dollar spent online last year, according to analyst eMarketer.“Yes, I am a publisher, but what does it mean to be a publisher when Apple News is a publisher?” says Santiago. The algorithms that choose what news we see on Apple News and Facebook prioritize the establishment and the advertising follows.“It’s dangerous. I wonder if people realize how much of a funnel these companies are.”Having a physical product helps. Williams compares the renaissance in physical magazines to the new popularity of vinyl. “People love sitting down with it, holding it. It’s good to put your phone down sometimes. It doesn’t feel like work,” he says.But trying to get a foot in the door with advertisers is impossible.“The higher up you go the whiter and straighter it gets and the less and less interested people are,” says Santiago.The problem has been exacerbated by the number of titles available, says Fitzgibbon, and by mainstream media’s greater focus on queer issues. “Advertisers still clearly want the pink dollar, but you don’t have to go niche to reach it,” he says. Them’s “launch partners” include Burberry, Google and Lyft.Like her cohorts, Gagnon is a huge fan of print. Not least because it creates an archive. Gagnon recently spent hours poring over the Quebec Gay Archives in Montreal. “There was such good stuff from the 80s, 90s and further back. More recently there was nothing,” she said. The internet is probably to blame for that. Physical products have left us a record of queer history. We do not yet know that the internet will do the same.But making a physical product costs money, and Gagnon says there seems to be even less interest in advertising for lesbians than for gay men. Even shipping magazines is expensive. Until LSTW found an international distributor, it was costing them $100 to ship 10 copies.“We know there is a need for a magazine like this,” she said. “Now we are trying to make it more of a business. It’s not easy.”There are other business models. At Posture magazine, a queer-run art, fashion and culture magazine, Winter Mendelson has ersified. Mendelson, who identified as non-binary and uses theythem pronouns, also didn’t see themselves reflected in mainstream publishing. “All I saw was gay boys for gay boys,” they say. “It was very binary. All the men’s magazines, and even some of the biggest women’s ones, are run by men.”Posture is now an online magazine, a print publication, podcast, a membership program and Posture Media, a creative agency and production studio that promotes ersity in the media and advertising industries. Zappos and HBO are clients.Mendelsohn says they had mixed feelings about corporate America’s newfound love of the queer community. “I just hope it’s not a fleeting fad. But what’s most important to me is social progress.”It’s not easy being a queer indie publisher, says Santiago. “But it’s worth it. It’s cool to be able to celebrate this culture.” Santiago doesn’t trust mainstream media to do that. “It’s not just about printing a load of rainbow stickers and saying love is love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3695cccd44cb35c9218fb789e0c4b06f2123557/0_409_4880_2927/master/4880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10139f6e119fe4e435c700afd212774b","title":"khashoggi case could impact uk support for saudi involvement in yemen","story":"Middle East minister rejects calls by aid agencies for UK to demand unilateral ceasefireThe outcome of the investigation into the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi could potentially impact on British support for Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the war in Yemen, the UK’s Middle East minister has said.Speaking on Tuesday, Alistair Burt told the House of Commons it was “not an illegitimate question” to ask whether the inquiry would reveal something of the character of the regime in Riyadh and that this would have a bearing on the war in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia entered in 2015.In an often stormy session of the international development select committee, Burt stood his ground despite warnings from aid agencies that Yemen was heading towards one of the worst famines in history and claims he was not using British diplomatic influence at the UN to end the civil war between the Saudi-backed government and Houthi rebels.He rejected impassioned calls by aid agencies and former senior diplomats for the UK to use its influence to demand a unilateral ceasefire and the full deployment of humanitarian aid.A London meeting of the Elders, the most senior group of former UN diplomats, called for the UK to encourage the UN to take urgent, credible action to lift the humanitarian blockade. The group, chaired by the former UN climate change special envoy Gro Harlem Brundtland, also demanded an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia.Burt was speaking as the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, held unscheduled talks in London with Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen. Conservative backing for the war in Yemen has been badly damaged by the Khashoggi murder, even if there is little support for the Iranian-backed Houthis.Burt repeatedly insisted the UK was not a party to the conflict and blamed the Houthis for the failure of talks organised by the UN envoy in Geneva.His claim drew a furious response from the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who told Burt: “We arm the Saudis. We maintain the air force. We have British soldiers embedded in the control centres. We command the war flight paths. We train Saudi pilots in Wales – the only thing we don’t do is press the button to drop the bomb.“Can we just not be honest? We are party to this war. We have decided to cosy up to a regime that dismembers its own civilians in consulates of Nato allies.”Burt responded, saying: “We are not party to the conflict, we do not control any flight paths, the coalition is acting in defence of a legitimate government.”Ending UK support for Saudi Arabia would not bring an end to the conflict, he added, while rejecting efforts to push for a new ceasefire resolution at the UN, saying Griffiths did not support such a move since it was unlikely to be accepted on the ground.Earlier, Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the UK was one of a small group of countries that could stop Yemen’s relentless deterioration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca06ba32f4de545473ae7fbd6023676ecee76f4/0_188_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ada53f1024bc5ec933aca9e6f8852b94","title":"debate final brexit deal could use rare commons procedure","story":"Opponents fear ministers will use multiple choice system to pick their preferred answerMPs debating Theresa May’s final Brexit deal could have a succession of options put before them in a rare procedure that second referendum campaigners fear will be used by ministers to select the answer that suits them best.The clerk of the House of Commons has suggested that if ministers held to their insistence that no amendments could be put to May’s final deal for legal reasons, “stand-alone consecutive motions” could be debated instead.Sir David Natzler is due to give evidence to MPs on the Brexit select committee on Wednesday morning, where he is expected to be questioned on the multiple choice procedure that could include an option to hold a second referendum.The consecutive motion idea has been used twice before to present a series of options to MPs relating to reform of the House of Lords in 2004 and 2007, Natzler wrote. Each time, however, no real changes took place as a result.If May is able to successfully conclude the Brexit negotiations, MPs are expected to debate whether to give their approval in the week before Christmas, with the crucial votes taking place possibly as late as 20 December.Campaigners are considering whether to use that point to stage a vote on whether to hold a second referendum, but it is not clear whether, if passed, it would be binding on the government.This month Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, provoked alarm among pro-remain MPs when he submitted legal advice saying May’s final deal had to be approved via “an unequivocal decision”, indicating that approval could not be subject to amendment.Natzler’s suggested scheme theoretically provides a compromise but second referendum campaigners said it should be rejected. The Labour MP Chris Leslie said he worried that if ministers allowed “a smorgasbord of resolutions” they could use the procedure to “conveniently ignore the resolutions they don’t like”.Leslie said the government would only have to act on MPs’ wishes if they successfully submitted amendments to the principal motion. “They are resisting the right for MPs to table amendments prior to the main question precisely because amendments could force them to do what the Commons insists.”Normally, amendments are debated on by MPs in the Commons before the substantive resolution is put to a vote. Ministers have indicated they are likely to propose a business motion to set aside the traditional procedure, although it is not certain in any event it would be carried, with up to 15 Tory MPs indicating they may not support it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe68e9020d2eb1976e159be553bd7e47e2df186/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13a1323410100d5a2b5b1417dd44939","title":"george osborne we got things wrong in run up to eu vote","story":"Ex-chancellor says promise of migration target was undeliverable, and admits fears for Tories’ futureGeorge Osborne has admitted the Conservative government “didn’t spot the shift in politics” that led to the leave vote in the EU referendum, saying it had failed to fix the banking system or explain the positives of immigration or the EU.The former chancellor, who edits the Evening Standard, said his party “did get things wrong” in the run-up to the 2016 vote, including promising a net migration target – of tens of thousands – that could not be delivered.“I think we were wrong to play into the debate that everything that Brussels did was a challenge and a battle,” he told Newsnight. “We were too late in the day trying to explain some of the benefits of European Union membership.”He said David Cameron’s pledge that net migration would be below 100,000 was not possible to deliver and would not be delivered in the future, but suggested that had led to claims that leaving the EU would be the only way to meet the target.“We definitely contributed to that argument. We didn’t make enough of the value of immigration,” he said.Osborne said that argument had then been used by a minority of leave supporters who were convinced by the “rather esoteric issues of constitutional sovereignty”, which had not previously been an issue of major public concern.“We allowed that kind of minority concern – because we pool sovereignty in all sorts of different organisations like Nato – to be linked to immigration control. And that was pretty lethal in that referendum debate,” he said.During the interview, Osborne defended his decision to make £12bn in welfare cuts, though he did not specifically address whether the cuts were too much.“It would be a bit odd to leave out the very large chunk the government was spending on welfare,” he said of his austerity measures.He said Philip Hammond’s budget, in which the chancellor said the era of austerity was coming to an end, was “a perfectly natural end point to the repair job on the public finances”.Osborne said he was deeply concerned about the future of the Conservative party, which he said had fuelled his personal criticism of the prime minister, whom he has previously called “a dead woman walking”.He said: “I worked very hard all my life to make the Conservative party electable. And it’s painful to me to see it losing support in large areas of the country where it shouldn’t be – particularly against a Labour opposition that I don’t think is in a fit state at the moment.”He said his party had won previous elections by being “socially progressive and fiscally conservative” but in the last election had “tried to out-Ukip Ukip” which he blamed for the loss in support.“We ain’t going to win the next election by trying to out-Corbyn Corbyn,” he said of the Labour leader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e7545e00c14d55b8874c905a0fb53c892312c2/764_273_1938_1163/master/1938.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=594c849a85c2d17b45f55d9b3f3a60ee","title":"has new ghost subatomic particle manifested at large hadron collider","story":" ‘Something terribly new’ goes bump in data yet to be confirmed by Atlas detectorScientists at the Cern nuclear physics lab near Geneva are investigating whether a bizarre and unexpected new particle popped into existence during experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.Researchers on the machine’s multipurpose Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector have spotted curious bumps in their data that may be the calling card of an unknown particle that has more than twice the mass of a carbon atom.The prospect of such a mysterious particle has baffled physicists as much as it has excited them. At the moment, none of their favoured theories of reality include the particle, though many theorists are now hard at work on models that do.“I’d say theorists are excited and experimentalists are very sceptical,” said Alexandre Nikitenko, a theorist on the CMS team who worked on the data. “As a physicist I must be very critical, but as the author of this analysis I must have some optimism too.”Senior scientists at the lab have scheduled a talk this Thursday at which Nikitenko and his colleague Yotam Soreq will discuss the work. They will describe how they spotted the bumps in CMS data while searching for evidence of a lighter cousin of the Higgs boson, the elusive particle that was discovered at the LHC in 2012.The Large Hadron Collider creates particles by smashing subatomic protons into one another at close to the speed of light. When the protons meet, the energy in the collision is converted into mass, and so particles, in line with Einstein’s equation, Emc2.Many particles created in the LHC are highly unstable and immediately decay into lighter, more stable particles such as photons and electrons. It is by looking for an excess of these particles, apparent as a bump in the data, that physicists tend to find new particles. For example, one way the Higgs boson betrayed its existence was through the unusually high number of photons recorded in collisions in which the particle was made.But particle physics is no easy pursuit. To the endless frustration of its practitioners, bumps in data produced by nothing more than statistical fluctuations pop up all the time. The best way to distinguish between these and Nobel prize-winning discoveries is to analyse more and more data: statistical flukes always vanish with time.In two separate analyses, the CMS team found data that pointed to a build-up of muons, or heavy electrons, in their detector. If real, the data indicates a new particle with a mass of 28GeV or 1 billion electron volts, slightly less than a quarter of the mass of a Higgs boson. Whatever it is, it is not the particle Nikitenko and his colleagues were looking for.To complicate matters further, the bumps were more pronounced in the LHC’s low energy collisions than in more energetic collisions the machine performed after an upgrade. That could be explained, said Nikitenko, if more “background” particles are produced at higher energies that then obscure the signal.Because the analysis is so time-consuming, it could take the CMS team another year to confirm or rule out the existence of a new particle. But Karl Jakobs, spokesperson for the Cern team that works on Atlas, the LHC’s other multipurpose detector, said it was checking its own data for signs of the proposed particle. “We are working on a similar analysis of the Atlas data, however I cannot yet give you a timeline when the results will become public,” he said.For Atlas to cross-check the result was “crucial”, Nikitenko said. “If it is confirmed by Atlas it will be the real thing. It will be really something terribly new.”One independent study has already reported potential evidence for the particle. Arno Heister, a former member of the CMS team who knew about the bumps in the data, analysed older results collected by Aleph, a detector on Cern’s previous particle accelerator known as the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP). He found a similar bump at 30GeV. “This excess, if real, is something very unexpected,” he told the .Georg Weiglein, a theorist on the German Electron-Synchrotron machine (DESY) said it will be hard to come up with a model that has a particle like the one the CMS bump calls for. “This does not exclude the possibility that such a signal could actually exist. On the contrary, it would be even more exciting if a signal were observed that does not seem to fit into our present models,” he said. “Further experimental information is eagerly awaited.”Michelangelo Mangano, a researcher at Cern, said: “Of course theorists are always happy when some anomaly shows up in the data. And I am confident many colleagues have started looking into this. However it is a bit early to get excited.”“Given that Atlas has yet to release their analysis, and given that much more data is on tape even for CMS, it is clear that the effect will soon be confirmed or diluted away,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f81c1d55254ab87ba8adf9e746224b463bc61068/47_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a40f0dd89c8f9f2815d9507b76eb98f","title":"the lazy zombies guide to youth a radio course with the power to change lives","story":"A new course from ŠKODA is giving young adults a chance to explore their creativity, voice their feelings and expand their skillsOnce home to countless giants of broadcasting, Manchester’s Granada Studios is now a training ground for a new generation. Though the telly sets are long gone, it remains the home of Reform Radio, an online station that also acts as an incubator for young people interested in a career on the airwaves.And if getting ahead in creative industries means subverting expectations, it’s clear the latest batch of students are off to a good start. Huddled around mixing desks and microphones, the show they’re workshopping is called The Lazy Zombies’ Guide to Youth – a sardonic riff on the perceived lack of motivation and creative energy often attributed to the digital generation.They arrived on Monday with little to no relevant experience by the end of the week they’ll produce and present the show to a gathered audience of friends and family. A project from ŠKODA in partnership with The Prince’s Trust as part of the former’s Driver’s Seat Initiative – which aims to celebrate independently minded people who want to make a positive difference to the world – it’s open to 16-25-year-olds who are not in education or employment. That’s a fairly broad window of eligibility, so what drives participants to get involved?For Rhys Forteau, 19, it’s about generating a creative spark. “I think that doing something creative helps you understand yourself a bit better – you find new sides to yourself, and that gives you more motivation,” he says. “My mum wanted me to be a care assistant. I did a bit of training and I enjoyed it at first, but it’s not something I could see myself doing in five years’ time. This course has shown me I can make my own opportunities, not just follow in others’ footsteps.”Along with independent thought, another trait in no short supply among the group is tenacity. Jacob Bowen and Sophie Heng-Travis, both 24, have worked in a number of jobs since graduating with qualifications in creative fields, though both feel they have yet to realise their full potential. For them, the course is an opportunity to widen their skillsets and meet similarly ambitious people.“For me it’s about building my toolkit,” says theatre graduate Bowen. “It’s alright doing filler jobs for a while, but I graduated three years ago. It gets a bit tedious.”Writer and poet Heng-Travis agrees, and suggests it’s a lack of persistence that leads to a lot of young people falling short of achieving their dreams. “I think for some people our age, it’s sad that you have to settle and just do something that’s not what you want to do. But you have to make money and be part of the system, which can mean doing something that’s mediocre. That’s what I find frustrating. But you’ve got to be persistent, you’ve got to keep going.”Course tutor Adam Seymour has not only seen the effect the course has had on countless young people – he’s also a living, breathing testament to the power of training to change lives. He took a similar course himself as a student two years ago, at a time when mental health issues had been holding him back. “I didn’t have a lot of confidence in my own abilities,” says Seymour. “I needed a bit of a boost, a safe space, I needed people around me who were in the same boat, because sometimes when you’re suffering with anxiety and depression and other wellbeing issues, it’s hard to reach out to people.”Seymour’s experience suggests it’s not simply inidual qualities, but rather a joint mentality of determination, and a willingness to collaborate, that’s the key to making the most of a course like this. Bowen agrees: “Having a platform where we can use that fire in our belly, from all the things that are going on with today’s youth, is massively, massively important. It’s about getting together with a few different people from different backgrounds, being on a level playing field and having something to say.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe65b87703bc20d82471bd0973fbb747ddce33b/424_137_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a5d6d90abb53b06b0c38d325c1d324","title":"why young creatives are choosing theatre over digital mediums","story":"Theatre may not seem like the natural medium of young people, but a creative course from ŠKODA is finding that plenty of aspiring young people are keen to get a start in the craftGathered in a studio space within Birmingham Repertory Theatre are a group of people who have either discovered an incredible anti-ageing product, or are bucking a serious trend. According to audience-monitoring charity Audience Agency, younger people are in such short supply at the theatre that the typical crowd’s average age is 52 years old. This lot, it seems, are the exceptions.The group are taking a week-long theatre course that’s part of ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative, which works in partnership with the Prince’s Trust, to give people aged 16–25 not in education or employment a leg-up. The initiative includes starter courses in all sorts of digitally-focused creative industries that you might expect the younger generation to opt for instead of fusty old theatre, so what’s the allure of this most analogue of mediums?“It’s an evolving art form, which fascinates me,” says 21-year-old Freddie Apperly. “What’s considered the norm of theatrical practices today, could be old school and prehistoric in 20 years’ time.” Considering the proliferation of immersive theatre, and the cross-pollination of mediums evident in entertainment such as Secret Cinema and escape rooms, it’s hard to disagree with him.For Laurie Weston, 22, a grounding in theatre is the ideal way to pick up transferable skills. “It’s a great way to learn collaboration and teamwork,” he says. “You’ve got actors who bounce off each other, then you’ve also got people who design the set, sound and lighting who all have to work closely together to get the cues right.”To other young people, the very fact that theatre isn’t a primarily digital medium is all part of the appeal. “Curiosity drove me because I just wanted to know how it works,” says 18-year-old Harry Bell, who’s keen to get backstage to find out more about sound and lighting. “I went to see Chicago with school – now, I can’t remember a thing about Chicago, but I just remember thinking: ‘How are they getting those actors’ voices from there to my ears?’ I wanted to know how it worked, the acoustics of the theatre, I wanted to understand that.”As well as a reputation for appealing to older generations, theatre also carries an image of inaccessibility and elitism at a grassroots level. And while today’s would-be thesps are well aware of the barriers to entry, it seems these are not enough to put them off. For 20-year-old Danni Manley, it just means being more selective about the doors you try to shove your foot in. “I went to apply for drama schools, but you have to pay to audition and I couldn’t afford them all, so I only did two out of three,” she says. “It’s quite annoying. It doesn’t put me off, it just makes it harder.”Bell, for one, is taken by a medium that offers an alternative to the polished, nipped and tucked output of most digital media consumed through a screen. “With theatre, you can’t really fix anything in post,” he says. “You have to get it right, there and then. That’s definitely something I want to do, without a doubt in my mind.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c926293d5473a42cacf821fdbeadc499bfcb5f77/0_199_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66ceb4fcf41e515425f3a898d73c07c8","title":"she is looking for memories love after dementia photo essay","story":"Gladys Saroli’s frontotemporal dementia is a cruel disease but her husband, Jose, spends every day by her sideGladys Saroli’s hand is warm and soft to the touch. She gives mine a gentle squeeze.“Hola,” she greets me softly, but soon turns back to the daytime television that fills the common room. Her husband, Jose, is all smiles and handshakes beneath his black cap advertising Peru, the country of their birth, and observes: “Gladys, she look good and well.”Six months ago, when I first met Gladys and Jose, this was not the case. Gladys has frontotemporal dementia. It is a cruel disease that affects the right and left lobes at the front of the brain. Her mobility is limited and speech is almost non-existent. Unlike Alzheimer’s disease, it affects younger people and, rather than targeting memory loss, it begins with a deterioration of speech and abnormal personality changes. The frontal lobes are where we process what we see and hear, meaning the breakdown of these areas results in changes in mood and behaviour and a progressive deterioration of motor function and cognition. “It is a disease which presents with early behavioural or language changes, as well as other cognitive changes including some memory loss,” says Associate Professor Michael Woodward, an expert in the field.When Jose raised the topic with Gladys he was met with confrontational and aggressive moods, which was out of character. Gladys was a strong, intelligent, open-minded woman whose devotion to her husband and family never wavered. Jose and Gladys had been inseparable since resettling in Australia amid political instability in Peru. Belief in each other is the cornerstone upon which their relationship is founded, and to see that belief erode from Gladys pained Jose. “She accuse me of having the hungry eyes. She say: ‘I see you have the eyes for a woman.’ This make me feel no good, because she not believe in me.”After testing and diagnosis, Gladys’s health deteriorated and the family decided to move her to an aged care facility where she would have immediate access to physical and mental healthcare. Jose would remain her primary carer. Since diagnosis, he has spent every day by her side and only when she drifts off to sleep does he return to the family home. “We do have a number of spouses and relatives who visit daily and support their loved ones but this is quite exceptional. It is the commitment Jose and indeed their children have also shown to supporting Gladys which is a standout for me,” says Darinka Rozanic, the manager at Moran Aged Care, where Gladys lives. “The labelling of photos to help support memories, the enthusiasm displayed for participating in activities and events and in general speaking with Gladys even when she could not. They all see the person, not the disease.”The daily care has meant the family, particularly Jose, sees any change in behaviour or health and can act immediately. In April, Gladys’s shoulders were hunched, her eyes vacant and she slept for much of the day. Six months later, she is upright and living permanently outside the specialised dementia unit. That improvement is a testament to Jose’s dedication to Gladys’s wellbeing.“If she is showing a certain type of behaviour, it’s about having the patience to go through, try this, try that, to find a cause then eliminate that for her,” says Roxana, Jose and Gladys’s daughter. “Six, seven months ago her general wellbeing was very bad. No walking, no movement, no facial expression. Dad noticed that and said: ‘No way. This is not what’s meant to be.’” Jose asked to see a specialist and it was decided to slowly reduce Gladys’s medication. He kept a diary to monitor her progress. Roxana adds: “She is more settled, happier. As long as she is good, we are good. She has taught us so much through this.”Jose says: “My favourite moments now are birthdays. Family birthdays she come back to our house in Epping. She is looking, looking. She is happy. She try to remember. To me, she is looking for memories.” Dementia is a formidable foe for the 436,366 Australians living with the disease. Research has yet to find a cure and positive prognoses are scattered.“There are so many factors in ensuring a person with dementia has good quality of life,” says Belinda Nixon, services operations manager at Dementia Australia. “If you are engaged, if you’ve got support, if you are having your needs met, you are going to be better off. No doubt about it.” Jose is in a fortunate position – he has a supportive family, a facility working with him and access to support networks. Sitting in Gladys’s room, surrounded by images of a life lived before dementia dug in its claws – a family portrait at the beach, birthday candles blown out, smiling grandchildren – I ask why he does all that he does for Gladys. Jose touches his heart and says: “Because she is in here, always. She is in here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/037bd9ab5472753fcc0e4fa2b638ca5a970dac76/0_165_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e136a7dd602e2509ad3c59b4ae0343cf","title":"cricket spot fixing al jazeera ecb icc","story":"Al-Jazeera’s second expose prompted a slanging match with authorities but the question should be not whether spot-fixing exists but who is doing it and how oftenSeems like it was Mark Wood’s bad luck to draw a short straw last week. The day after al-Jazeera released the second part of their investigation into spot-fixing in cricket Wood was put up to talk to the press. He said the accusations reminded him of “the boy who cried wolf”. Maybe Wood always used to fall asleep before his parents made it to the end of the book. Right now, five months after the first part of al-Jazeera’s expose, we are still waiting to see whether the danger they are shouting about really exists, but Wood, like everyone else in English cricket, will hope this story does not end with everyone looking the other way while the wolf eats up the sheep.Al-Jazeera’s second film was more grounded than the first. It’s built around the fact that its source, Aneel Munawar, accurately forecast the score in 25 out of the 26 passages of play in 15 different international matches. Al-Jazeera says independent analysis shows the odds he could have done that by guesswork alone are 9.2m to one. The case is not perfect the one big problem with it is al-Jazeera’s lawyers do not seem to trust it enough to let its journalists release the names of the players involved. But there is enough evidence there now that the story should not be swiftly dismissed.Which, unfortunately, seems to be what some of the authorities want to do. The England and Wales Cricket Board said al-Jazeera’s information was “poorly prepared and lacks clarity and corroboration”. The tone of its response was all wrong. If the ECB wants to demonstrate how serious it is about tackling spot-fixing there are better ways to do it than shouting down the people who are presenting the evidence. The ECB’s statement seemed to put it on the other side of this problem to the journalists working to expose it. Since then the conversation around the investigation has turned into a slanging match about which side is more credible than the other.Al-Jazeera did not help by throwing back blows of its own. “The ICC, together with certain national cricket boards and their supporters in the media, has reacted to our documentary with dismissals and attacks on the messenger,” it said. “We are particularly struck by what appears to be a refusal from certain quarters to even accept the possibility that players from Anglo-Saxon countries could have engaged in the activities exposed by our programme.” That attitude may have been common once and there may still be lingering hints of it around now. But anyone who holds it is a fool.At this point the question is not whether people are spot-fixing cricket matches but who is doing it and how often. In the last 10 years bowlers, batsmen, and captains, umpires, coaches, groundstaff and administrators have been caught and banned for fixing, and they have come from England, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Zimbabwe. You should not need any more evidence that this is a universal problem. But, if you do, Cricinfo published some last week. It was the story of a corrupt approach made to the Canadian wicketkeeper Hamza Tariq at the 2011 World Cup.Tariq explains how a friend of a friend invited him out for drinks. The man was a cricketer, which is how they got to know each other. When they went out a second time the man brought three more friends along. They bought Tariq dinner and drinks, and offered, later in the evening, to fix him up with a woman. It was only later, after an officer from the ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit intervened, that Tariq realised they were grooming him. Tariq was a fringe player from an associate team but last I looked the weaknesses those fixers were trying to identify and exploit – fondness for drink, money, sex – are pretty common in countries where they play Test cricket, too.That 2011 World Cup, it seems now, fell right in the middle of an era when spot-fixing was rife. Mohammad Amir, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif, Mervyn Westfield, Lou Vincent, Danish Kaneria: all those cases happened in 2010 and 2011. It was also around that time, al-Jazeera says, that Munawar first became involved in fixing. It also says the ICC has known about Munawar ever since, which is one reason why it is reluctant to hand over all the information it has but would prefer to give it to Interpol instead. “We have become increasingly concerned at the ICC’s ability and resolve to police the game.”It is not the only one to say this. Remember, Brendon McCullum criticised the ACU’s “very casual approach” in 2016. The head of the ACU, Alex Marshall, argues the unit is much stronger now and the sport has never invested so many resources in fighting corruption. But then, at the same time Marshall is saying that, the Pakistan Cricket Board has appoint Wasim Akram to its new cricket committee. Akram, you may remember, was one of a number of cricketers investigated by the Qayyum report into fixing in the 1990s. The Qayyum report concluded he “cannot be said to be above suspicion”.The PCB chairman, Ehsan Mani, was able to justify the appointment by arguing that other players who were named in the Qayyum report were allowed to carry on working in international cricket. And he is right. One of them, Mushtaq Ahmed, was England’s spin-bowling coach for years, even though Qayyum concluded “there are sufficient grounds to cast strong doubt” on him, too. At this point indignant words do not do much to demonstrate anyone’s commitment to taking the problem seriously enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7640de8a5c7142729203b0fe1372f3986f7202f0/0_237_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86e0c3a175e38796b9ed0bbee11ec79d","title":"simone biles world gymnastics championship team gold usa kidney stone","story":"Simone Biles is now an 11-time world champion after leading the USA women to team gold at the World Gymnastics Championships in Doha on Tuesday.Biles had the highest inidual score in the entire competition on the floor, uneven bars and vault as the US recorded a total of 171.269, with Russia second on 162.863 and China winning bronze with 162.396.

According to Eddie Jones, the Tests are mere sparring sessions as preparation for next year’s World Cup in Japan. Those who have paid serious money to watch the All Blacks tackle England and Ireland beg to differ, preferring here and now evidence to pie in the sky potential.The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Rare is the northern hemisphere side who drag their feet through the autumn leaves and still go on to conquer the world within 12 months. There is a particularly strong correlation between England’s November form and their World Cup destiny stretching back years.In the autumn before their 2003 triumph, Clive Woodward’s squad dispatched New Zealand, Australia and South Africa on successive Twickenham weekends, scoring almost 39 points per game on average. In 2010 and 2014 they went down to the All Blacks and South Africa and never quite regathered sufficient momentum.Who could possibly argue, too, that Ireland will be no further forward psychologically if they beat New Zealand in Dublin on 17 November or that victory over the Wallabies on Saturday week is irrelevant to Welsh morale? Try telling the respective players of Italy and Georgia, furthermore, that their fixture in Florence on the same day will have nil impact on the debate about Six Nations promotion and relegation. To dismiss any of those encounters as sparring sessions would be insultingly fake news.England, either way, risk straying into punchbag territory if they perform abjectly on the next two Saturdays. Losing to the All Blacks is an occupational hazard but defeat first up at home to a Springboks side shorn of several key iniduals? Nor can the body language and energy levels of Jones’s players after their lengthy warm-weather training camp in the Algarve afford to be downbeat. Start sluggishly and they may find themselves camping in Aldershot next time.England are missing some key men themselves, particularly in the pack but, after five defeats in their past six Tests, there comes a time when all involved need to front up or step aside. In Portugal these past few days there have been some encouraging signs, not least in terms of the players’ collective conditioning. Those still standing look encouragingly fit, if that is not too much of a tautology.Some within the Rugby Football Union are also suggesting there is less pressure on the squad than there might normally be. Give it a good rattle against a physical South Africa and prove competitive against the All Blacks and, if nothing else, Jones will have competition for places when the Vunipolas and others return. The dark clouds, some argue, will only gather in earnest if England contrive to lose either of their final games to Japan or an underperforming Australia.Maybe, but with a trip to Dublin awaiting Jones’s squad on the opening weekend of the 2019 Six Nations, these remain delicate days in terms of English confidence. Recruiting Will Carling as a leadership guru is all very well but, less than a year out from a World Cup, it does not smack of “steady as she goes” serenity. Both Ireland and Wales are ahead of England in the world rankings, with the power to add in the coming weeks. England, even if their results are not flawless, should be performing better and more consistently than they are.The Irish, admittedly, have yet to crack the World Cup code but their showdown with New Zealand will be instructive on both sides. Without the absent Conor Murray at scrum-half will they be quite as formidable or is their Leinster core steely enough to cope? Will Johnny Sexton upstage Beauden Barrett again? It is a clear sign of the times when the Aviva Stadium, rather than Twickenham, is due to stage the month’s most eagerly-anticipated encounter. Having already lost to the Springboks in Wellington last month, the All Blacks may just be heading for another fall.This would also be a good moment for Warren Gatland’s improving Wales and Gregor Townsend’s enterprising Scotland to lay down some significant markers, though precisely where Saturday’s fixture between the teams in Cardiff fits into the equation is debatable. Thankfully the WRU and SRU have jointly pledged to donate a six-figure sum to Doddie Weir’s foundation from the proceeds of the game but arranging to play it outside the Test window on a Pro14 weekend has further highlighted the fault lines within the modern international game.Should an understrength Ireland second team really be playing Italy in Chicago this weekend? Will the RFU be reimbursing those fans who bought tickets fully expecting to see the English-based Faf de Klerk, Willie le Roux and Vincent Koch representing a fully-loaded South Africa? Will stricter high-tackle interpretations lead to 13-a-side contests? Suddenly we are back into the murky world of experimental sparring, as opposed to meaningful occasions.The international game, at its best, is a glorious thing. Those who wilfully cheapen it do so at rugby’s global peril."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a770ae2e05c2458f51d39e0a5d85aa83ecade74b/0_478_3924_2354/master/3924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e5698c7dc3c82102ae5d281b3644fea","title":"apple launches new macbook air retina display","story":"Fan favourite updated with Touch ID and new keyboard and launched alongside new Mac MiniApple has finally updated its most popular laptop, the MacBook Air, with retina display and Touch ID fingerprint sensor.The new lower-cost Apple notebook adopts many of the technologies Apple introduced with the MacBook Pro in 2016, including a large Force Touch trackpad, new keyboard and two Thunderbolt 3 ports in the side for power and connectivity.It ships with eighth-generation dual-core Core i5 processor along with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, costing £1,199 ($1,199 in the US), undercutting both the smaller 12in MacBook and the cheapest MacBook Pro in cost.The once-popular MacBook Air was last updated in early 2015 with Intel’s fifth-generation Core chips and graphics.

The body is aluminium and glass, rather than having stainless steel sides, which makes it a little less slippery and easier to grip.Despite being well made, it feels less luxurious than the iPhone XS or previous all-metal iPhones, but given most will put it in a case I suspect it won’t make much difference. It’s worth noting that Apple is not making cases for the iPhone XR, meaning third-party manufacturers are your only option.The iPhone XR comes in a large range of colours. It looks stunning in the red or white colours, but a little cheap in the yellow option. The increased screen size and larger bezels makes it 4.5mm wider than the iPhone XS, but 1.7mm narrower than the iPhone XS Max, which with its rounded edges makes the iPhone XR right on the limit of what I am able to use one-handed. Those with smaller hands will struggle. The iPhone XR is also wider than rivals such as the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro, 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ or the 6.4in Huawei Mate 20 Pro.The iPhone XR has the same A12 Bionic chip as the iPhone XS and XS Max, but has only 3GB of RAM compared to 4GB for the more expensive models.Day-to-day performance is indistinguishable between the new iPhones: iOS feels snappy and fluid, while gaming performance was similar too. There will be times where the iPhone XR will have worse performance because of the smaller amount of RAM, perhaps during heavy multitasking, but I couldn’t find any in real world usage.Battery life on the other hand is all-round better than both the iPhone XS and XS Max, which lasted 24 and 27 hours respectively. The iPhone XR lasted over 32 hours between charges, matching last year’s iPhone X, meaning it would make it from a 7am wake up alarm until around 3pm the next day.That was while using it as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone XR also technically has a slower 4G modem than the iPhone XS, but given that in real-world usage the limit on speed is not with the phone but the 4G provider, it is unlikely to make any difference.The iPhone XR runs iOS 12 and is identical to the iPhone XS, complete with grouped notification handling and integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.The lack of 3D touch means some of it works a little differently. To quick reply to a notification from lock screen you have to swipe left on it, select view, then reply, rather than just press harder on it.Other tasks such as launching the camera from the lock screen are now activated by long-presses rather than hard-presses, but shortcuts from apps such as direct access to the selfie camera or a quick preview of the next event in your calendar are not supported.The truth is I’ve never really used 3D touch gestures apart from the one to clear all notifications or for quick replies, so I didn’t miss them.The iPhone XR has one-half of the iPhone XS’s camera, having the same 12-megapixel wide angle camera but not the 2x telephoto camera.The result is a camera that captures very similar-looking standard photos to the excellent iPhone XS, with excellent dynamic range, colour and detail, and good low-light performance. In fact it’s not until you try to zoom in that you can really tell the difference. The 5x digital zoom is still surprisingly good, but it isn’t a patch on the hybrid zoom produced by the dual-camera system.Likewise, portrait shots of people are good with a much wider angle than that produced by the iPhone XS, but you have to get closer to your target for the face detection to work properly and produce the effect. You’re also limited to shooting people and it lacks some of the more advanced lighting effects.The selfie camera is identical to that on the iPhone XS, producing good but not overly detail-rich selfies.Overall, the cameras on the iPhone XR are really good and a massive step up on the iPhone 7 or older, but not the best available on a smartphone.The iPhone XR is available in black, white, blue, yellow, coral and red, costing £749 with 64GB of storage, £799 with 128GB and £899 with 256GB.The iPhone XR is an odd proposition. For many it will be the most attractive iPhone just because it is £250 cheaper than the iPhone XS, but it’s important to note that at £749 it is in no way cheap.Many top-end rivals cost around the £750 mark while offering better screens, better cameras and more capabilities – and some even undercut it by as much as £250.But for the Apple-only buyer, what you get with the iPhone XR is most of what makes the iPhone XS good, just not the bits that make it truly great. It doesn’t feel as luxurious, the bezels are larger and the screen isn’t as nice, the camera isn’t quite as capable and it isn’t the best iPhone you can buy, which undoubtedly is some of the appeal of a £999 smartphone.The iPhone XR does last longer than the other 2018 iPhones, and it comes in some stunning colour options. If you must buy an iPhone but can’t or won’t spend £999 or more, the iPhone XR is the smartphone for you.Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, glass will break if dropped, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

A friend of his, saddened by having to move away, was given a lock of hair by a female friend to remember her by. Since then, women visiting from around the world have added to the collection (and donating now forms part of a competition to win a holiday in Cappadocia, including participating in Chez’s pottery workshops).• chezgalipIn the 400-year-old walled city of Gruyères, at medieval Château St Germain, visitors can step inside the dark creative mind of Swiss artist HR Giger.

Well, Ruby strode. Kim-Joy walked, and Rahul looked like he was being escorted by an invisible guard towards a burning stake and felt it no more than he deserved. It is his way. While all are worthy finalists, it is Rahul who has probably garnered the most attention and emotional investment over the weeks. There are those who saw his unremitting gloom, his certainty of failure and permanent air of doomy anxiety as a pose or a ploy. The rest of us simply saw ourselves.When he noted after being made star baker that “As soon as something good happens, something bad comes behind it”, we nodded. When he told the camera at the end of a bad week with Scananian bakes “I don’t deserve to be here any more”, we felt represented. From now on, when we stare into the abyss we can see Rahul staring back and describing his prevailing mood as “very dooming”.But who could begrudge magnificent Ruby a win? She eats pain for breakfast and only gets stronger with every mouthful. Or Kim-Joy who will ice you a wonderland and stuff your mouth with golden toffee crackle through her laughter and her tears?The customary opener, the signature bake, was a dozen doughnuts – six ring, six filled. Kim-Joy got busy with an amaretto diplomat filling and tiny bee decorations. Ruby went hell for leather with two different flavoured doughs and a piping bagful of dulce de leche. And Rahul – has never had a doughnut. He went for a mango crème patisserie filling (his piping bag burst) and buttercream flowers atop the rings “to make them look like wreaths.” It was all very Rahul and never more so than at the end when they were, against the odds and his fervent belief, pronounced delicious.The technical was flatbreads over an open fire, which was – excuse me while I dip into professional jargon for a moment, but needs must – a really stupid idea that tested only contestants’ camping skills and I will be registering a complaint with the Paul Hollywood ombudsman later today, but at least it got Kim-Joy her first technical win of the series.Then the showstopper – which Rahul did have to stop with because in the heat of the tent one of his storage jars exploded. Just his. No one else’s. I suspect, because I carry Rahul in my heart, that in some deep way this soothed him. Pessimists are always relieved when disaster finally strikes. It’s the closest we get to happiness. He tidied up while the other two participants got on with creating their magical landscape desserts (choux mountains, passionfruit sponge hills, pistachio unicorns and praline dust paths for our Ruby, the lost city of Atlantis in gingerbread for Kim-Joy), and had extra time added for his bake – a 200-piece recreation of a Victorian garden - at the end.And… he won. He probably still, three months after filming ended, doesn’t believe it but we do. The man who came from Kolkata to study for his PhD here seven years ago and began baking at the suggestion of his surrogate family here (“Look,” says his ‘dad’ pointing at a childhood photo of Rahul, “You’re not even smiling then!”) as a way to meet people and make friends is handed the trophy. And you realise that a world in which he wasn’t would have felt very dooming indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2824e2c8614ee0cedf6b51a2ca5f696504896671/502_0_7435_4463/master/7435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=814057332c4897b1fc19738ff69231f7","title":"the bi life is this the first queer friendly dating show","story":"While Love Island has become a big hit, its format is rigid and doesn’t allow for same-sex relationships. E!’s new show could be the answerAlong with the blistering heat and the glimmer of World Cup glory, the overriding theme of the summer was just how invested the nation became in one Spanish villa. Love Island was the sleeper hit turned national phenomenon, with even peripheral player Hayley Hughes briefly steering the nation’s Brexit conversation.In reality, though, it proved a slightly different proposition. A group of young single people have been dispatched to Barcelona in the company of ShaneCourtney. So far, so Jack and Dani. However, they’re not dating each other but meeting with others outside of their circle. Plus, they’re all bisexual. Oh, and there’s no prize money, because, really, there’s no game to play here. Rather, it’s all about exploring who you are and finding people to click with, no matter what your circumstances might be.International swimmer Michael has never had time for a relationship but is keen to get to know people of both genders. Daisie found out her ex had a secret family, and is trying to work through her understandable trust issues. Matt had his most serious relationship with a girl, but is open to dating men, too. The emphasis here isn’t on challenges or rivalries – instead the group support one another as they embark on new, nerve-wracking experiences. For Michael, that means going on his first-ever date, while for more confident Ryan, that means meeting a girl who thinks that the Sangria Familia is a famous Spanish landmark.Lacking a scripted-reality feel (bar an argument between Daisie and her date Adam where you could practically here the director shout ‘cut!’) the Bi Life’s more naturalistic mood puts it closer to something like First Dates. As such, it’s the perfect environment for the group to explain bisexuality both to each other, and to the audience at home. The Bisexual presented a fleshed out representation of bisexual life in London, and The Bi Life is adding to the bi canon.These aren’t the sort of conversations you tend to see on a reality show, let alone one focused around dating. When Daisie’s date admits that bisexuality isn’t for him but a threesome with two girls would be quite alright, it’s a microcosm of how being bisexual is often trivialised – and sexualised – in popular culture. Meanwhile, Mariella admits that lots of people read her as straight in her day to day life, unless, of course, she’s at a gay club. And the girls all admit they don’t know anything out bisexual men, or why a stigma surrounds them.The Bi Life isn’t perfect. Hopefully as it continues, we’ll learn more about the group, and they’ll become closer with one another – right now they have the kind of quickly formed closeness of people on an 18-30 tour which, to be fair, they sort of are. Besides, we need some love triangles for this to be thrilling as well as gamechanging. My money is already on the guy with the tombstone-like veneers that Michael was flirting with in the trailer coming in and causing a storm. The idea is for the housemates to date outsiders but, of course, if two members of the group took a shine to each other and paired off? In a show that’s all about challenging stale norms, it seems the possibilities are endless.The Bi Life continues Thursdays 9pm on E!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b3d71cafab20fd8fed48b6bab483aa71d8804ff/0_1_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=779aecc191f1e65941fcc810f910214b","title":"kanye west says hes distancing himself from politics my eyes are wide open","story":"The statement likely results from a falling out between the rapper and a rightwing provocateur over the ‘Blexit’ conceptIs the strangest political marriage in America finally over?Rapper Kanye West, who earlier this month hugged Donald Trump in the Oval Office, declared on Tuesday that he had been “used to spread messages I don’t believe in” and would now be “distancing” himself from politics.The statement is likely to come to a blow to the US president, who has touted West as a prominent black supporter even as his approval rating among African Americans barely touches double figures.West’s primary falling out appears to be not with Trump but Candace Owens, a rising star of the right who was lavished with praise by the president at a gathering of young black conservatives at the White House last week.On Twitter on Tuesday, West said he supports prison reform, common-sense gun laws and compassion for people seeking asylum, then denied that he had designed a logo for a branding exercise known as “Blexit,” which urges African Americans to leave the Democratic party. The concept, originated by Owens, claimed that West had designed the group’s merchandise.“I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine,” West wrote. “I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it.”Evidently stung by the experience, he then followed up: “My eyes are now wide open and now realize I’ve been used to spread messages I don’t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!”She added: “#BLEXIT is about the beautiful stories of so many black people who have awakened themselves to the possibilities of our future, as Americans. The press is trying to use Kanye’s name to create drama and further isiveness which is WRONG.”Owens, who grew up in a Democratic household, is now a fierce critic of the party. In one Twitter post, she says: “There is no group in America that has been more lied to, more abused, or more taken advantage of by the Democrats than black people.”During his bizarre visit to the White House recently, West commented: “You know, people expect that if you’re black you have to be Democrat. I’ve had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat.”In a rambling monologue that silenced even Trump, the rapper, sporting a “Make America Great Again” cap, told him: “It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That’s my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape.”West has faced widespread criticism for such comments and for his endorsement of a president who critics accuse of emboldening a movement of white nationalism through his words and deeds. The star has made baffling comments about abolishing the 13th Amendment and slavery being a choice.Journalist Alex Wagner tweeted in response to West’s announcement: “Apparently Kanye did not understand that “sitting in the Oval Office with the president of the United States and railing against liberals” would be seen as explicitly, uhm, political. But please (for real) go back to creative pursuits”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e616286827f60f979da7ed2d05549aefb613bfc/0_118_4680_2808/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=842087f7f4ea1ac9a4bf615614758016","title":"swim england in deep water for swimsuits to flatter women advice","story":"National sports body removes web advice on ‘flabby stomachs’ and ‘too long torsos’ after student’s criticismSwim England’s guidance on choosing swimwear has been criticised for focusing too much on the shape of women’s bodies.The national governing body for swimming in England suggested on its website suitable costumes for female swimmers with short or long torsos, in the plus size bracket, with a “pear shape”, with a large or small bust, a “flabby stomach” or “boyish body”. The web page was later taken down.“Ensuring you have the right swimwear for body shape is vital. It’s important to be honest with yourself or the person you are buying for. It can make a world of difference,” the guidance noted.Simone Webb, a PhD student in gender studies, came across the guidance while searching for a swimsuit to buy. She said: “I was thinking about trying to swim again because I needed to get my cardio exercise up to track and wanted to do something warm and indoors. I was genuinely surprised and shocked that the national government body would have something like this on their website.”She said the guidance suggested that making women’s bodies look as close as possible to a particular feminine ideal was the most important thing when choosing clothing in sport. Although Swim England’s advice was aimed at encouraging people to swim, the guidance risked deterring women from the sport, she claimed.The guidance covered “swimwear material”, “know what the swimwear is for”, and “choosing swimwear for women by body shape”. The last section went into the greatest detail, but there was advice on appearance in other sections as well. Under swimwear material, the guidance told female swimmers: “If you have a bodily feature you like, use bright colours to highlight it. Alternatively, to hide a less loved feature, use solid colour.”Webb said: “I can’t quite work out how it got there in the first place. How did someone write that and thought yeah this is spot on?”A Swim England spokesperson said: “This was an old web page from 2010 that does not represent the views of Swim England. As soon as it was brought to our attention we removed the page and are in the process of replacing it with more appropriate information.

Subsequently, Coalition air strikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen,” Pompeo said.“Substantive consultations under the UN special envoy must commence this November in a third country to implement confidence-building measures to address the underlying issues of the conflict, the demilitarization of borders, and the concentration of all large weapons under international observation,” the secretary of state added.Pompeo did not name the venue for the talks, but Mattis said it would be Sweden. The fact that the secretary of state issued a late-night statement shortly after the defence secretary, with fewer details, raised the possibility that Mattis had not coordinated his disclosures with others in the administration.Talks planned in Geneva in September failed to take place, as Houthi representatives refused to attend without guarantees of safe passage for their wounded soldiers. The two sides have not held talks for two years.The three-year conflict has already taken more than 10,000 lives and efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to strangle the economy in Houthi-run areas threaten to help trigger a famine, which the UN says could be the worst the world has seen for a hundred years.“Thirty days from now, we want to see everybody around a peace table, based on a ceasefire, based on a pull back from the border,” Mattis said during an appearance at the US Institute of Peace. “That will allow the special envoy, Martin Griffiths, who is very good, who knows what he’s doing, to get them together in Sweden. That is the only way we are going to solve this.”Since the failure to hold talks in September, Griffiths has unveiled a new peace plan built on confidence-building measures including reopening the airport in the capital, Sana’a, prisoner swaps and payment of civil service salaries.The former head of US disaster relief assistance, Jeremy Konyndyk, suggested the administration was beginning to panic about what could happen in Yemen, and the growing congressional opposition to US backing for the Saudi coalition, especially after the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.“UN envoy Martin Griffiths was in DC last week and his briefings must have turned some heads within the administration. They’re moved quickly to give him some running room,” Konyndyk said in a series of tweets. “No administration wants a famine on its watch – and particularly one that would be so closely tied to the White House’s Saudi policy.”David Miliband, chairman of the International Rescue Committee and former UK foreign secretary called on other Security Council members to back what may lead to the most significant breakthrough in four years. He said “the UK and other members of the UN Security Council should be ashamed at their silence in backing the US move”.Burt told MPs on Tuesday that the UN Envoy Griffiths opposed a UN resolution on Yemen being tabled, but it is understood that Griffiths would support a resolution being tabled within weeks, around the time he is due to brief the UN.Diplomats are reluctant to draw the connection in public, but acknowledge Saudi Arabia has been weakened by its role in the murder of the Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, and so is newly vulnerable to Western pressure to conciliate in Yemen.The US defence secretary did not say what action the US administration would take if the warring parties did not agree a ceasefire or attend the talks. The US, along with the UK and France, supplies most of the coalition’s weaponry, but has refused to curb the flow of arms in the face of high numbers of civilian casualties and the coalition’s use of blockades and other economic measures to cut off Houthi areas, where most of the population lives, from basic supplies."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

The wildlife does not disappear. And everybody beyond the rank of turning a shovel doesn\u0027t come from the US to do that job... Oh, and by the way, we don\u0027t leave the country billions of dollars in debt.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security The Great British Bake Off 2018, finale review: a cockle-warming triumph of talent over cynicismChristian woman Asia Bibi spared death sentence in Pakistan after blasphemy conviction overturnedGeorge Osborne says it has been \u0026#39painful\u0026#39 to watch Tories lose support under Theresa May as he urges her not to \u0026#39out-Corbyn Corbyn\u0026#39Halloween 2018: how trick-or-treating is really a Celtic traditionComment: Shy, self-effacing, milk-drinking Bake Off champ Rahul proves it\u0026#39s what\u0026#39s on the inside that countsNaomi Watts cast in lead role in Game of Thrones prequelWorld\u0026#39s largest statue unveiled amid controversy over £330m price tag and scale of environmental impactNew K-pop idols caught up in South Korea\u0026#39s diplomatic feud with JapanNorth Korea \u0026#39preparing to allow international inspectors to visit Punggye-ri nuclear test site\u0026#39Comment: It\u0026#39s wrong to use NDAs to cover up misdemeanours at work – whether the behaviour is unlawful or not Comment: Hallowe\u0026#39en\u0026#39s not for me, or my kids.

No major movements were spotted at Yongbyon.The move to open up Punggye-ri to inspection, if confirmed, would be seen as a confidence-building measure ahead of a proposed second meeting between Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, and Donald Trump, the US president.The meeting is expected to take place early next year despite concerns in Washington that North Korea is dragging its feet over nuclear disarmament and frustration in Pyongyang that the US has not agreed to ease economic sanctions or an official end to the Korean War of 1950-53.Washington has repeatedly reminded its regional allies of the need to maintain “maximum pressure” on the North Korean regime to give up its nuclear weapons – a policy that appears to be increasingly at odds with a push from South Korean President Moon Jae-in towards closer economic ties.The US embassy in Seoul reportedly made the unusual move of contacting major South Korean conglomerates that sent representatives to Pyongyang with President Moon for his September summit with Kim Jong-un.“The U.S. Embassy in Seoul is known to have directly called key companies to discern the status of the cooperation projects discussed during their visit to the North,” a key official from the presidential Blue House told the JoongAng Ilbo on Tuesday. Executives from Samsung, Hyundai Motor, LG and SK were among 17 business representatives who accompanied President Moon on his three-day trip.North Korea is likely to depend on South Korean investment for its future economic development.  “It appears that the U.S. government, along with the objective of grasping the situation in regard to North Korea-related projects, is attempting to synchronise the speed between the South and the United States ahead of North-U.S. denuclearisation negotiations,” said the source.Teleconferences in late September between the US Treasury Department and seven South Korean banks over sanctions enforcement were also viewed as a sign that Washington is nervous that inter-Korean relations appears to be advancing faster than denuclearisation talks.Please review our commenting policyThe Great British Bake Off 2018, finale review: a cockle-warming triumph of talent over cynicismChristian woman Asia Bibi spared death sentence in Pakistan after blasphemy conviction overturnedGeorge Osborne says it has been \u0026#39painful\u0026#39 to watch Tories lose support under Theresa May as he urges her not to \u0026#39out-Corbyn Corbyn\u0026#39Halloween 2018: how trick-or-treating is really a Celtic traditionShy, self-effacing, milk-drinking Bake Off champ Rahul proves it\u0026#39s what\u0026#39s on the inside that countsNaomi Watts cast in lead role in Game of Thrones prequelWorld\u0026#39s largest statue unveiled amid controversy over £330m price tag and scale of environmental impactNew K-pop idols caught up in South Korea\u0026#39s diplomatic feud with JapanComment: It\u0026#39s wrong to use NDAs to cover up misdemeanours at work – whether the behaviour is unlawful or not Comment: Hallowe\u0026#39en\u0026#39s not for me, or my kids.

The heads of 22 villages around the Sardar Sarovar Dam where it is situated wrote an open letter to Mr Modi criticising the cost and environmental destruction caused by the statue.We all villagers want to tell you with extreme grief that we will not welcome you on October 31. Even if you come here like an unwanted guest, you are not welcome here, they wrote.The choice of Sardar Patel, who was a member of the rival Congress Party, has raised some eyebrows - but is seen by historians as a nod to Mr Modi’s vision of himself as uniting a new India for the global age.How the Statue of Unity comparesThe base of the statue, which has a viewing deck for 200 people, is created from metal that was collected from all around India since 2014 and smelted down as a symbol of unity.Vallabhbhai Patel, through the sheer act of unifying the modern nation state of India, is more Lincolnesque than most people realize, Anil Ram Sutar, the son of the nonagenarian sculptor who designed the new statue told NDTV. So this is Modi\u0027s Lincoln memorial.Known as the ‘Iron Man’, Mr Patel was India’s first Home Minister, a no-nonsense negotiator who also possessed the ability to coax religious and political rivals to the table.Indian workers give the finishing touches to the statue of Indian independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai PatelIn addition to Mr Patel, the BJP has been actively honouring other independence luminaries, such as Dr BR Ambedkar, a social campaigner and father of the Indian constitution, and ‘Netaji’ Subhash Chandra Bose, a freedom fighter who believed in violent action to oust the British. Both are also Congress members.The Patel statue was built in 33 months, but not content with one giant statue, Mr Modi has already commissioned another of a warrior king in the state of Maharashtra, set to be ready by 2021.Please review our commenting policyThe Great British Bake Off 2018, finale review: a cockle-warming triumph of talent over cynicismChristian woman Asia Bibi spared death sentence in Pakistan after blasphemy conviction overturnedGeorge Osborne says it has been \u0026#39painful\u0026#39 to watch Tories lose support under Theresa May as he urges her not to \u0026#39out-Corbyn Corbyn\u0026#39Halloween 2018: how trick-or-treating is really a Celtic traditionComment: Shy, self-effacing, milk-drinking Bake Off champ Rahul proves it\u0026#39s what\u0026#39s on the inside that countsNaomi Watts cast in lead role in Game of Thrones prequelNew K-pop idols caught up in South Korea\u0026#39s diplomatic feud with JapanNorth Korea \u0026#39preparing to allow international inspectors to visit Punggye-ri nuclear test site\u0026#39Comment: It\u0026#39s wrong to use NDAs to cover up misdemeanours at work – whether the behaviour is unlawful or not Comment: Hallowe\u0026#39en\u0026#39s not for me, or my kids.

And it adds new features, like the Apple Watch charging, which will not work on any third-party chargers.Apple also said it would be able to charge up the AirPod wireless earphone, using a special new case. That also did not arrive at the event.The AirPower\u0027s\u0026nbspstandout feature is that it is able to charge three different products at once, using a wide variety of charging technology. And those products can be placed absolutely anywhere on the wide mat.It is thought to be that complicated system that has taken Apple so long to develop.Apple is rumoured to be potentially holding another event next month. But it is expected to unveil new iPads\u0026nbspand Macs at that launch, making it unlikely that the iPhone accessory is being saved until then.This article was originally published in September, after Apple\u0027s iPhone event. It has been updated and re-published, after the October event passed without any mention of AirPower at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is available to order now ahead of a release date on 7 November.Alongside the MacBook Air came a new Mac Pro, which benefits from the same recycled metals, a new look, and vastly upgraded internals. Both the Mac Mini and the MacBook Air have been neglected for years, with so little attention that some feared it was more likely they would be killed off than refreshed.The iPad Pro came with a similarly radical redesign, which removes the home button from the bottom and almost entirely gets rid of the bezel that has traditionally wrapped around the sides of the screen. That also meant Apple brought a\u0026nbspnew way\u0026nbspof unlocking it, with the introduction of Apple\u0027s Face ID facial recognition technology into the tablet for the first time ever.Apple removed the Lightning port on the bottom of the iPad, and swapped it for USB-C. That has been used on some of Apple\u0027s laptops, but will mean that owners will no longer be able to charge their iPad and iPhone with the same cable.iPad ProApple also introduced an upgraded version of the Apple Pencil, which was first introduced with the first iPad Pro. It now charges by clicking onto the top of the tablet, and features a button on the side that can be press for extra controls.Alongside that came a new look for the Smart Keyboard that is sold alongside the iPad Pro.The new iPad\u0026nbspPro comes in two sizes: an 11-inch version, which because of the smaller bezel takes up the same space as the previous 10.5-inch one, and a bigger 12.9-inch size.The smaller one starts at $769 and the bigger\u0026nbspat\u0026nbsp$969. Both are available to order now and will also go on sale on 7 November.Below is our live blog from the event, detailing Apple\u0027s announcements as they happened.Apple is holding its October event in New York this year. Leaving California is a strange decision, especially when the company relatively recently opened the Steve Jobs Theater that was built specifically for this kind of launch. But it\u0027s probably doing so because of the venue: the Brooklyn Academy of Music. That has a beautiful, old theatre, and is presumably part of an effort to emphasise creativity that is also in keeping with the iPad Pro and the unique Apple-themed invites that were created for each invitee.\u0026nbspTo add to the weirdness, the timings are all a little strange. In part that\u0027s because of the location – the timezone means that everything will be happening earlier than usual, when it\u0027s held on the West Coast – but also because the US is still in summer time when the UK isn\u0027t, meaning the gap is only four hours compared to the usual five.The Apple Store is DOWN, so you can\u0027t buy anything new even if you wanted to. (That includes the brand new iPhones.)\u0026nbspIt used to be said that Apple had to do this, because its ancient back-end meant that it couldn\u0027t put new products up on the shop without taking it down entirely. But the site got a redesign relatively recently and you would have thought that would have been fixed.\u0026nbspSo now it\u0027s not clear why it happens, but it does, every single time. Do they just want to build anticipation ahead of the event? Does it still need all that time to be fixed up instead? Or are they being nice, making sure that people don\u0027t buy products that are just about to be overtaken by something new?Here\u0027s some more detail on the Brooklyn Academy of Music, from the Ibrahim Salha, the Independent\u0027s head of audience and former New Yorker:\u0026nbspI\u0027m a former BAM member, and I think Apple have done brilliantly in choosing the venue for their latest event. It\u0027s a stunning space, as Andrew points out, and will make for quite a departure from the usual announcement live streams we tune in to. Depending on how long the event lasts, attendees can nip in to one of the movie theatres and watch A Star Is Born, or go for a wander around Brooklyn. I recommend the Cesar\u0027s Empanadas food truck – worth waiting in line for.Apple will be livestreaming the event, of course. And you can find that here.Sorry, I was wrong: not just\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspApple logo. A whole big selection of them, presumably from the same pool that Apple used to send out unique invites to all of the attendees today.\u0026nbspSome of them are actually pretty nice and oddly satisfying. So maybe you do want to fire up the live stream now, despite there being another seven minutes to go.

Ruby and Kim-Joy tried their hardest, keeping cool heads throughout, but neither had quite the culinary flair of the winning baking wizard.The Independent live-blogged along with the episode, which you can read below. Before that, here are the five biggest talking points from the episode.While he may have eventually created a stunning showstopper (made to look like a rock garden), Rahul\u0027s final bake got off to a horrific start: a glass jar exploded at his workstation because of the heat, contaminating his ingredients and meaning he had to start all over again. Luckily, Paul and\u0026nbspPrue\u0026nbspoffered\u0026nbsphim an extra 15 minutes to complete the 200 components required to make the showstopper. Talk about pushing yourself.\u0026nbspBake Off final review: Rahul joins an illustrious list of bakersFor apparently the first time in Bake Off history, the finalists\u0027 technical challenge did not take place in the tent, but outside. Under the blazing summer sun, the trio made pitta bread. And under the blazing summer sun, they all struggled, particularly Rahul who didn\u0027t quite understand how to manage the fire. When Kim-Joy came out the winner of the technical challenge, she seemed a sure-fire hit to take home the winner\u0027s trophy. Of course, her Atlantis-inspired showstopper couldn\u0027t top Rahul\u0027s (with Paul calling her\u0027s slightly flat).Ruby, what happened?Ruby came into the final a firm favourite to win, having astonished the judges by taking home Star Baker the previous two weeks. However, an unfortunate tasting doughnut to start the final, following by\u0026nbsplast\u0026nbspplace in the technical, and Ruby was at the bottom of the pack. On the plus side, if any of\u0026nbspthese finalists are to become\u0026nbspa media personality in the near future, it\u0027ll no doubt be the charming Ruby.Yes, we\u0027ve spoken about Rahul\u0027s disastrous smashed glass incident, and his inability to keep a fire going. But lest we forget that the eventual winner also managed to burst his icing bag while filling up a doughnut, leaving behind a fruity mess. It\u0027s bewildering that Rahul has managed to look after himself in the real world at this point.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

There are tears galore on screen, and occasionally even some at home. Perhaps the most heart-wrenching moment this year was Rahul\u0027s calling\u0026nbsphis proud mother to say he won.\u0026nbspA lovely moment to end the series on. Until next year, Paul,\u0026nbspPrue, Noel and Sandi.\u0026nbspRead along as it happened with our live-blog below. Please allow a moment to load.\u0026nbspHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s Bake Off live-blog, bringing you all the latest from the\u0026nbspBerkshire based tent. Tonight, we will discover which of the three remaining bakers will be crowned this year\u0027s champion.With only hours to go until tonight\u0027s final, former contestant Terry —\u0026nbspthe older gent\u0026nbspwith the wonderful moustache, remember? —\u0026nbsphas written a letter expressing his thanks to everyone who supported him on the show. Nawwww.\u0026nbspThe latest from the bookies (because yes, you can bet on who will win Bake Off): according to one company, betting has been suspended on Rahul taking home the winner\u0027s trophy.\u0026nbspHe was on\u0026nbsp52 odds, ahead of fellow finalists Kim-Joy (31) and Ruby (31).So, how did the Bake Off finalists avoid telling letting slip\u0026nbspthat they spent\u0026nbsptheir summer baking in a tent?\u0026nbspRuby was asked recently, saying: I barely told anyone about Bake Off but the trickiest was dodging all the questions from workmates about what I was up to on weekends, where was I always going, why was I always tired.\u0026nbspI honestly blamed it on weddings. So many Indian weddings. Thank god Indian weddings normally last a week - it was a great alibi.Some quotes from Rahul: I used all of my holiday leave this year for Bake Off, which I normally would use for my trip to India.\u0026nbspI told my colleagues that this year I am not going to India, so will use up my holidays in organising my flat and having long weekend trips to the countryside.\u0026nbspFor friends outside work, the excuse was my high workload which required me to work some of the weekends. The rest of the time I said I was at barbecues or summer parties at work colleagues.And finally, the most recent words from Kim-Joy, on how she nearly revealed to a friend that she was on Bake Off: I remember a friend eating one of my practice cakes for the Bake Off, and he said to me it was delicious and I should apply for the Bake Off!\u0026nbspI was impressed with my rare ability to keep a straight face, as inside I was rolling with laughter! I said to him, \u0027Maybe next year!\u0027So it begins. The Bake Off finale is here, beginning with a quick montage of all those bakers past. Plus, Sandi teasing an outdoors challenge?\u0026nbspBake Off\u0026nbspreturns next year on\u0026nbspChanel 4.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Bitcoins can only come into existence if a computer “mines” them, which means the computer must solve complex math equations, sucking up electricity. Part of the economic draw of Bitcoin is that it cannot be produced easily or cheaply, meaning it is unlikely that it will be mined so quickly that it loses value. There is also a cap on Bitcoin production: there will only be 21 million in total.Mining one bitcoin “could take as much energy in that transaction to power your house for months”, said Jon Truby, Director of the Centre for Law and Development at Qatar University. “Right now, that’s not sustainable.”It is hard to predict the future of Bitcoin: it is highly volatile and is sometimes worth less than the amount of money it costs to mine. The difficulty of the equation that the computer has to solve can also make mining bitcoins take more energy. Many economists suggests that the value will increase, and it is possible that technology could also improve mining efficiency in the future. Some argue that cash is also environmentally destructive.Alternatively, maybe mining Bitcoins will eventually become more efficient and use less energy. “The mining efficiency has been improving quite a lot,” Camilo Mora, lead author of the study, said. “That is because you make more money there. That is something that the mining companies have tried to push hard.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A scavenger collects recyclable materials along the breakwater amid strong waves as weather patterns from Typhoon Yutu affect Manila Bay.

This is evidenced by bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency turning 10, and by more and more governments, regulators, financial institutions, and retail and institutional investors, amongst others, appreciating the real and growing demand for digital, global currencies in today’s ever more digitalised and globalised world, he said.\u0026nbspThis is\u0026nbspalso underscored by the UK government Cryptoassets Taskforce’s final report which states that ‘the market is continuing to evolve rapidly\u0027, before adding ‘there is increasing institutional investment in this space, and many banks are starting to explore how they can interact with this growing market’.\u0026nbspThe report’s proactive and pragmatic approach towards regulation of the burgeoning sector should be championed.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But some analysts believe this is about to change.Nigel Green, founder and CEO of UK-based financial consultancy firm\u0026nbspdeVere Group, forecasts bitcoin will soon face strong competition within a booming cryptocurrency industry.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, he said.“However, I believe that bitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors.

As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, having seen a 2,000 per cent price increase in 2017 followed by a 65 per cent decrease so far in 2018.\u0026nbspSince early September, however, bitcoin has traded consistently at around $6,500, only ever fluctuating by a few hundred dollars.This trend has been helped by a lack of destabilising news in the cryptocurrency space, together with broader consensus on how to address some of the technological\u0026nbspchallenges facing bitcoin.stabilized in recent months (CoinMarketCap)Should such a trend continue, cryptocurrency expert Iqbal Gandham, who works for the online trading platform\u0026nbspeToro, believes the price of bitcoin will see steady gains over the coming years.Elon Musk posts bizarre bitcoin tweet about cryptocurrency scamsBitcoin has shown great resilience over the past decade.

He added: “This progress all underpins our commitment to growing distributions for our shareholders.”BP\u0026nbspaveraged 3.6 million barrels of oil per day over the quarter.Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: “Growth in renewable energy and the introduction of electric cars may be long-term worries for investors.“But as profits gush and cash flows, the here and now looks pretty rosy for BP.”However, oil prices slipped on Tuesday\u0026nbspas concerns grew that a trade dispute between the US and China could hurt economic growth.And signs point to\u0026nbspglobal supply\u0026nbspincreasing, despite US sanctions against Iran, the world’s fifth-largest oil producer.Brent crude was down 15 cents a barrel at $77.19 on Wednesday morning while US\u0026nbsplight was unchanged at $67.04.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The group posted an 8 per cent decline in retail sales, against a 12.7 per cent increase in online sales. In the year to day, total sales are up 3.7 per cent, Next said, with online rising by 14.8 per cent, while retail has fallen 6.3 per cent. Death of the high street?

However, shares dropped almost 5 per cent in early trading as sales growth slowed in the third quarter. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, put this decline down to the warmer weather in the first half of the year, which boosted trading at Next. “More recently, an Indian summer stretching into October will have pushed back the need for scarves and mittens. Nonetheless Next still remains on track to deliver its projected profits for this year,” he said. Mr Khalaf added: “With Christmas on the horizon we’re now approaching a crunch time for UK retailers, and in January’s trading statements we’ll get a good gauge of UK consumer appetite, and a rollcall of winners and losers on the UK high street.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some closures will be announced.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Players can get the ability to move around more quickly or to see in the dark, for instance.As well as being able to play in teams – either with strangers or people you know – each player is given personal awards depending on how they\u0027ve done.Special technologies had to be built to allow for the first multiplayer version of the game, Google said. The team built several systems to enable this multiplayer gaming, all running on the Google Cloud Platform, including integrating Open Match, a highly-scalable, open source matchmaking framework cofounded by Google Cloud and Unity, it wrote in a blog post announcing the new game.The Doodle is showing around almost all of the world – though not in Africa and some specific countries – and will presumably stick around until Halloween is over.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Pencil gets the biggest redesign, with a new shape, a button that can be used to change settings by pressing the side of the stylus, and magnets that allow it to clip onto the top of the tablet and charge as it does so.Live updates as Apple reveals whole suite of new productsThe new iPad Pro comes in two sizes. The smaller 11-inch takes up the same size as the existing 10.50-inch, using the extra space from the smaller bezels to pack in a bigger display the bigger 12.9-inch is the same screen size but has been reduced overall.Inside, it includes Apple\u0027s latest A12X bionic chip, which is an upgraded version of the processor in the iPhone XS and XR. It said that and other upgrades allow the new Pro to rival the Xbox One S for gaming performance, which it displayed by showing the latest version of the NBA 2K series.As well as those changes, Apple also swapped out the Lightning port that has traditionally been on the bottom of the iPad. In its place comes a USB-C port, which means that the tablet can be plugged into accessories like cameras or musical equipment – as well as charging the iPhone.The new iPads are available to order now, ahead of their full release on 7 November. The smaller one costs $769 or the same number of pounds, and the bigger one is $969.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

After a significant amount of time discussing a wide range of issues, Messi saw the power, professionalism and future within Sirin\u0026nbspLabs, and it was for these reasons he agreed to represent us to the masses.”Given the fact some celebrity backers of cryptocurrency-related products have resulted in scams, Sirin\u0026nbspLabs was keen to stress that this is not the case with Messi.“If you’ve followed Messi’s career at all, you’d know he doesn’t just put his name on anything to make a buck,” the post continued.\u0026nbsp“As the Greatest of All Time (GOAT) in the most popular sport in the world, you can imagine the type of vetting process that he and his team have to ensure they’re not going to associate with something criminal, illicit, or anything that might tarnish his stellar brand.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That allows the computer to be unlocked and things to be bought just by pressing the sensor next to the keyboard.It also includes Apple\u0027s newest keyboard and trackpad, the latter of which is 20 per cent bigger and stretches all the way across the top.The new computer has speakers that are 25 per cent louder, twice as much bass and wider stereo sound. It also has a new microphone, which allows people to sound better on FaceTime calls as well as being used for Siri, which is always listening and can be activated just by saying Hey Siri at any time.The MacBook Air will start at $1199, considerably more expensive than the old version of the computer. It can be pre-ordered now and will arrive on 7 November.But Apple appeared to be most proud of its new way of making aluminium, which allows it to make the computers using entirely recycled metal. That is why Apple is referring to the computer as its greenest ever Mac.The new MacBook Air was revealed at the same time Apple also revealed a new Mac Mini. That computer is vastly faster than the mostly neglected old version, as well as using the new kind of aluminium.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The group posted an 8 per cent decline in retail sales, against a 12.7 per cent increase in online sales. In the year to day, total sales are up 3.7 per cent, Next said, with online rising by 14.8 per cent, while retail has fallen 6.3 per cent. Death of the high street? Closures and cuts paint grim scene for 2018Next says post-Brexit border delays pose biggest threat to business Expectations vs reality: Women share their online shopping disastersThe company said it still expects sales growth of 3 per cent for the whole year, and is forecast to report annual pre-tax profit of £727m, a 0.1 per cent increase on last year. However, shares dropped almost 5 per cent in early trading as sales growth slowed in the third quarter. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, put this decline down to the warmer weather in the first half of the year, which boosted trading at Next. “More recently, an Indian summer stretching into October will have pushed back the need for scarves and mittens. Nonetheless Next still remains on track to deliver its projected profits for this year,” he said. Mr Khalaf added: “With Christmas on the horizon we’re now approaching a crunch time for UK retailers, and in January’s trading statements we’ll get a good gauge of UK consumer appetite, and a rollcall of winners and losers on the UK high street.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

That would not be in the national interest.”Some observers believe that the Budget announced by Philip Hammond on Monday resembled a pre-election budget, with accelerated income tax cuts and some other popular measures.Fresh elections could be tempting because the Prime Minister lacks a majority in the House of Commons, meaning there is a good chance any Brexit deal she negotiates could be voted down.Though she secured the support of the right-wing\u0026nbspDUP with an extra £1 billion for Northern Ireland after the 2017 election, the party has since said it would not vote for an emerging deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.But with the Conservatives yet to open up a\u0026nbspsubstantial lead in the polls – and memories of last year’s shock result still fresh –\u0026nbspthe PM appears yet to be tempted.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

One former head of the diplomatic service said other countries believed the UK had “lost the plot”.The Foreign Office has also been criticised for earlier plans to hollow out embassies around the world, in order to fund diplomatic posts in Europe.Now Mr Hunt, appointed in July, will insist the fears are misplaced, insisting the UK after Brexit can be an “invisible chain that links the world’s democracies”.And he will argue its role will be badly needed, when “our democratic values are arguably under greater threat than at any time since the fall of the Berlin Wall”Mr Hunt will say: “Our network of friendships is unparalleled.

Which is why to do so, we must become an invisible chain linking the world’s democracies.”The promise of a “network of friendships” comes after Mr Hunt’s gaffe, at the Tory party conference, when he likened the EU to “a prison” in the Soviet Union.Donald Tusk, the European Council president, accused him of “insulting” people who survived the horrors of communism and there were calls for him to resign.Meanwhile, Theresa May’s promise to achieve a new “Global Britain” outside the EU has been branded “mushy thinking” and just a “slogan”.DUP withdraws threat to vote down Budget to give May \u0027another chance\u0027General election ‘would not be in the national interest’, Theresa May If the new 50p really meant to commemorate Brexit, it should be honestCross-party MPs launch \u0027killer amendment\u0027 push for fresh EU referendumIn February, Sir Simon Fraser, the former Foreign Office permanent under-secretary, told MPs: “A lot of countries think, for the time being, that we have slightly lost the plot in terms of where we intend to go.”But, in his speech to the Policy Exchange think-tank on Wednesday evening, Mr Hunt will confirm plans for 12 new diplomatic positions abroad, in addition to nearly 1,000 extra personnel.They will include 335 diplomatic posts overseas, 328 new roles in London, and 329 new “locally engaged” staff, he will say.A new embassy will open in Dijibouti, in East Africa, the British Office in Chad will be upgraded to a full embassy and a mission will open at the headquarters of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, in Indonesia.The 20 extra languages the Foreign Office will teach will vary from the Central Asian tongues of Kazakh and Kyrgyz, to Shona in Zimbabwe and Gujarati in India.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

China SPY PLANE enters NO-fly zone - South Korea forced to scramble...She insisted the approach would be pragmatic and the early enforcement regime would not be overly rigorous.Ms Nokes added: We are quite clear that this is absolutely one of the conundrums employers will face - that people who have rights under the settled status scheme but haven\u0027t yet gone through the process to evidence that.The Tory minister said an immigration bill would \u0026ldquoturn off free movement once Brexit happened and remove the automatic right of EU nationals to live and work in Britain.She said in the event of the UK crashing out of Brussels without a deal immigration controls would apply to EU citizens arriving in Britain next year.Under the Government\u0027s proposed settlement scheme, EU migrants who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 can apply for settled status, meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely.Those who have arrived by December 31 2020 but do not have five years\u0027 residence can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status.EU citizens who arrive in the implementation period, which starts after the official exit date in March, will face no new curbs on living and working in the UK but will be required to register if they intend to stay for longer than three months.The settlement scheme is currently being trialled and will be fully operational next year.It is anticipated the total number of applications could run to more than 3.5 million.Ms Nokes told the committee: It is going to be an enormous challenge for both employers and EU citizens who do have the right to work to make sure we get them through the scheme as efficiently as we possibly can.Her evidence sparked claims the Government\u0027s approach to Brexit risks a repeat of the Windrush scandal.Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: \u0026ldquoLet me get this straight. @ukhomeoffice says EU citizens will have to prove their right to work in the UK after March next year - but it\u0027s 5 months away and the registration process has not been rolled out.\u0026ldquoWe\u0027re on course for another Home Office scandal on the scale of Windrush.Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey added: Millions of EU citizens in the UK have been living under a cloud of uncertainty for more than two years.Far from clearing up that uncertainty today, the Immigration Minister made it worse.\u0026nbsp            "},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"MET OFFICE warned trick or treaters to head out early as further rainfall pushes in this...BRITAIN will be threatened with windy and wet weather by a new front coming from the Atlantic at...BRITAIN is set to plunge into Arctic weather over the weekend as a band of biting cold air from...BBC WEATHER forecast a cold front from the Arctic to spill across Britain as the UK braces...BBC WEATHER has forecast “very dense fog” this weekend which could cause major delays on the...GALE force winds could rip through the north of Scotland, whilst rain, fog and murky conditions...STORM Callum is pounding the UK with gale-force winds leaving hundreds of people in Northern...Hurricane Michael is building in intensity as it barrels towards the Florida panhandle, leading...BBC Weather have warned Britain is on track for a dramatic 10C drop in temperatures as polar air...BBC WEATHER has warned that temperatures could plummet for northern parts of the nation towards..."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/153/590x/UK-weather-forecast-1038702.jpg","title":"uk weather forecast today met office latest october 2018 storm adrian hurricane oscar","story":"UK weather forecast: Halloween is set to be washout for some parts of the country (Image: WXCHARTS)Britons should prepare for a bout of unsettled conditions if they are heading out trick or treating tonight as the changeable weather rages on.The outlook for the weekend is likely to dampen autumnal festivities as storm Oscar hurtles in from the Atlantic Ocean.Temperatures, in general, will struggle to get into double figures over the next few days as the promise of a milder outlook dwindles.Commenting on the conditions, Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: \u0026ldquoJust about keeping temperatures above freezing in the far west.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result.

That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This will mean that the government’s flagship welfare reform is now more generous than the benefit system that it is replacing.While today’s reforms certainly won’t end all the problems some recipients have faced with Universal Credit, they should ease the rollout in the months and years ahead.But Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd said it wouldnt cover all the costs of the Osborne cuts., and there were still issues with the new system.He raged: UC’s serious design flaws were also not addressed, from long waiting times that are pushing people into indebtedness, to problems in how landlords are paid housing benefit.The pain caused by the roll-out of UC is not over yet.Today we revealed how a single mum is at risk of homelessness after going on to the new system - and isnt eligible for help with her mortgage debt payments.Tina Davidson says she feels tossed aside by the system and has had to put the house shes lived in for  years up for sale to pay off debts.The new system is designed to try and get more Brits into work and less reliant on the welfare system, but its been beset with problems.Many say its pushing them into debt as the wait for the first payment is at least five weeks.Others say they were driven to payday loans and even prostitution to try and make ends meet.Ministers say they are constantly trying to fix the systems problems as they go along - and the new system is much less complicated than the old one.It was reported earlier this month that ministers are planning moves to slow down the roll out to try and fix some of the issues.They can take out emergency loans, but have to start paying them back immediately so they get deducted from their benefits.Highlights of todays Budget include:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443834272-e1540837806705.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"latest telethon shows us once and for all that c4s just a load of cake and balls","story":"You watch BBC’s Children In Need, you’re getting Clare Balding, Doctor Who and dancers, whether you like it or not.ITV  It’d take sniper fire or a dinner setting next to Sir Phillip Green before Cowell was a no-show.Channel , though Apart from a bit of a secondhand cake-baking and Gogglebox, I was drawing a blank before Friday night.So it was with a mix of fascination and dread that I tuned into Stand Up To Cancer. A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A big, welcome cut in business rates for struggling firms.New ideas flowed: a levy on web giants’ UK revenues, potentially raising £million, is long overdue — though Philip Hammond must ensure the ­burden does not fall on online shoppers.There was major funding to help councils transform our hollowed-out High Streets, including turning vacant shops into homes. A huge increase in firms’ annual investment allowance will let them deduct from taxable profits up to £million spent on tools and machinery.Heathrow’s e-gates will now speed up entry for visitors from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as Europe — a symbol of a global Britain open for business.Some bad ideas The Sun has criticised, including the proposed “latte levy” on plastic cups, were binned. Duty was frozen again on fuel, as well as beer.Even the OBR’s normally pessimistic forecasts were on Mr Hammond’s side. Growth is predicted to rise steadily, albeit too slowly. Unemployment is set to fall to its lowest in  years.We wish the Chancellor had outlined more radical, visionary low-tax measures. He will need them should Brussels shove us into a no-deal Brexit. But that gripe aside, what was not to like The Tories must not try to ape Corbyn’s £trillion spending fantasy. But it is not “Corbyn-lite” to spend billions fixing Britain’s most pressing problems, evenwe are still running a deficit.As for Corbyn himself, it was obvious he took in barely a word of the Budget.In his “response” he merely recited his normal scripted complaints, flubbing his words and shouting randomly, as is now traditional. He somehow contrives to make even this chaotic Government look like a model of competence.Budgets often unravel when acres of small print are finally scrutinised.But for now... nice one, Chancellor.ANGELA Merkel is a once-brilliant politician scuppered by an arrogant disregard for voters.For years she was admired worldwide.

Cheyenne is really sweet about it and she doesnt really understand, thank goodness.We try to keep her away from it.But when she sees Im upset, she will come over and cuddle me and say its okay mummy. Its horrible and the people that are supposed to help just dont care.They are heartless.And she avoided going to the food bank for help because she was expecting to be paid on time.Kind strangers and neighbours have been helping her out with food in the meantime.Partner Chris was also signed off work as a chef for mental health reasons.A DWP spokesperson said: The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money. Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help.Universal Creditreplaces an out-of-date, complex benefits system with clf edges that disincentivised work and often trapped people in unemployment.

Cost of damage to the police car, Ford Fiesta and the HGV was estimated at a total of £,.In the earlier incident Parkinson and a group of friends stole a disabled mans Renault Scenic along with his disability scooter which was in the boot.Police chased him again and blocked in the stolen car in a suburban street where children were playing but Parkinson drove up onto the pavement, narrowly missing a child, before driving off at speed and losing the officers.The Renault was found days later completely written off, and the disability scooter was also damaged to the stage it was deemed ‘redundant’.In court Parkinson yawned and stretched his arms over-dramatically as he listened to the proceedings. He admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualied and twice breaching a criminal behaviour.Judge Mark Savill told him: “You have shown a lack of respect for the police and a lack of remorse and you have expressed no desire to change. So I must put the protection of the public and a punishment for you first.”He added: Youre just  but have an appalling record and and the footage of the pursuit I have seen is truly chilling.

It is a wonder how you didn’t kill or seriously injure a member of the public or a police officer.“Your pre sentence report makes a depressing read.

He has a large number of previous convictions starting from when he was just  for offences including vehicle crime, dishonesty, assaults on a police and public disorder offences.His lawyer Mark Fireman said in mitigation: “This is somebody who has had one of the worst starts in le.“He has been left with many dficulties.

As Nye Bevan once said “the language of priorities is the religion of socialism.” In his Budget on Monday Philip Hammond made clear his priorities and he definitely wasn’t praying at the altar of socialism. When presented with the choice of cutting taxes for the wealthy or helping those on the lowest incomes, he went for the former . Presented with the choice of handing high earners more than pound a year or ending the welfare freeze, he went for the former. Presented with the choice of cutting corporation tax or additional funding for education, the police and local government, he went for the former. Which made it remarkable that John McDonnell yesterday said Labour would not reverse the income tax measures in the Budget even though % of the tax cuts will benefit the top half of earners. Andy Burnham was one of many Labour figures to warn McDonnell’s position would not hold. The Greater Manchester mayor said he could not see how tax cuts for the wealthiest could be the priority when the police were so stretched and there are “people dying on British streets for want of a roof over their head.” Many Labour MPs also voiced concerns. Jess Phillips put it succinctly in a tweet this morning: “When Philip Green gets more from the budget than a midwe might I suggest we are on sh**ty ground.” The Shadow Chancellor, who is meeting business leaders today, is showing a pragmatism that comes with the challenge of seeking power. But you cannot help thinking thata previous Labour leadership had adopted this position he would have been one of the first to object. Even when Hammond made the right choice - the additional funding for the NHS - it fell short of what is required. As the IFS noted yesterday, the lt in NHS spending amounts to an increase of .% a year which is below the average increases of .% a year over the NHS’s entire history and the % a year over the period of the last Labour government."},{"url":null,"title":"american schoolgirl flies uk honour","story":"NewsAmerican schoolgirl flies to UK to honour great-great grandads bravery which saw him awarded Victoria Cross in World War OneEight-year-old Clara Levacy visited to honour Harry Greenwood, who is one of the most decorated men in British military historyShareCommentsByMichael Greenwood:,  OCT NewsClara Levacy, , travelled to the UK to honour her great-great grandfather Harry Greenwood VC\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLast week, an eight-year-old girl from San Diego, Calornia, left the United States for the first time in her le to travel to shyWindsor in Berkshire. She had been given special permission by her teacher to be absent and she has to write a journal for her class. And it is going to be quite a story. Clara Levacy had travelled with her family to honour her great-great-grandfather, who is one of the most decorated men in British military history. A hundred years ago on Tuesday, October , Harry Greenwood was fighting in the Battle of the Selle, in France, and was awarded the Victoria Cross for a series of acts of gallantry that many people have said mark him out as a “lunatic”.  Lieutenant Colonel Greenwood was leading the th Battalion of the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry on October ,  in a fierce battle against a battered but determined German army. Many of his men had been killed by a machine gun. Harry got up and, with bullets flying all around him, ran towards the gun post and killed the crew with grenades. Later that day, he again rushed a gun in the same way before leading his men to capture  prisoners and eight machine guns. The following morning he again ran towards Germans firing a machine gun. As the citation for his Victoria Cross put it: “He showed the greatest gallantry ... in the face of heavy fire. His valour was beyond all praise.” Harry is my great-great-uncle and I’ve read a letter in which he says he enjoyed “killing Bosche”. That’s a frightening and incomprehensible thing to read about someone who shares a signicant amount of your DNA. But now that I have read about how he handled himself in the trenches and how he fought so bravely to protect the men with him, I am shyincredibly proud.  Prior to being awarded the VC he had got the MCfor gallantry in  and in July  a DSOfor bravery under fire. In December,  it was announced he was also being awarded a “Bar” to add to his DSO for an occasion when he had fought off two enemy attacks – even after he had been blown up by a shell. As a Lt Col, Harry was one of the most senior ranks in the field – he did not have to stick his head above the trenches or run in front of his men. He could send “boys”, cannon fodder, to do the risky stuff. But not Harry. He ran with his men and ran from the front, and fought with them to protect them as best he could. He had been at war for four years, blown up by shells including friendly fire, been gassed and watched hundreds of his friends killed.  Shortly after the announcement of his VC, Harry wrote: “I did nothing really, save drive on, kill a few huns and cheer our own fellows on a bit when they flagged.” Harry’s brother, David, explained to family that Harry “lacked imagination” – while most people in combat worried about what would happen to themthey ran in front of firing machine guns, Harry was somehow able to block that out of his mind.  He was given his medal by King George V at Buckingham Palace in  and the Daily Mirror published his picture with that of four others awarded the VC that day. The following year he was part of the guard of honour when the Unknown Warrior was laid to rest at Westminster Abbey. In , Harry’s family donated his medals to the Regimental Museum of the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry in Doncaster. In , the Government announced that every VC winner from the First World War born in the UK would be honoured with a paving stone laid in the town of their birth. So that is why I was joined last week by my rd cousin Clara Levacy and  other relatives from the extended Greenwood family in Windsor to mark the shycentenary of Harry’s actions.  If anyone there was in doubt of the signicance of Harry’s achievements, Colonel Dan Reeve of The Rlesspoke to say: “Hiswas an exceptional le that showed a pattern of selfless behaviour in which he routinely placed the interests of others before that of his own.  “He understood that a successful le was not one that pursued self-gratication, but rather one that sought to serve others and build society.” As we watched that paving stone being unveiled by a representative of The Queen and listened as a bugler from The Rles Regiment played Last Post, I read out the names of the  men from Harry’s battalion who died in the two days for which he was awarded the VC.  Among them was the name Harry Greenwood – when I first read it I thought it was a mistake but then I checked. By sad coincidence, on the day one Harry Greenwood got the VC, another Harry Greenwood from the same battalion was killed in action. Private Harry Greenwood was the son of a musician from Wombwell, nearly Barnsley – and he was just . We remembered him as we remembered our Harry.

Parkinson, who has an appalling record amassed since he was just eleven, also posted bragging pictures of himself smoking suspicious looking cigarettes on social media and spelt his own name in cannabis leaves.  Yesterday he began a sentence at a young offenders institution for another string of offences, including reversing a stolen Fiesta into a police officer who was trying to catch him. Parkinson stretched and yawned loudly as he was handed a four-year sentence at Manchesters Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester Evening News reports.Describing how Parkinson had reversed into the police officer, the judge said: You tried to get past and rammed into the front of the lorry. The very brave police officer, doing what police officers do on behalf of decent members of society, got out and tried to approach you. What did you do  You reversed. The door was open and caught him, sending him flying onto the bonnet of his car. What he must have been wondering at that time one can only imagine. The court heard how the police officer could have been killed. Parkinson had amassed  previous convictions for  crimes from the age of , the court heard.This included twice assaulting police officers as well as robbery, violence, theft of vehicles and flouting court orders. His defence barrister told the court Parkinson had one of the worst starts in le I have seen and is extremely immature for his age. The judge said he accepted what the teenagers barrister said, but added that there comes a time when the public has to be protected. Parkinsons name and face were earlier published on October , , when he was made the subject of a criminal behaviour order which banned him from the Smallshaw estate in Tameside and disqualied him from driving until . The order made little effect.  On May , this year, he stole a specially-adapted Renault Scenic, which carried on board a mobility scooter and was owned by a disabled man. The owner thought he had lost the keys and had called for roadside assistance, but then saw Parkinson and his young male friends get in the car, with the keys, start the engine and drive away. The car was spotted in the Smallshaw estate that night, with residents reporting a car was screaming around the streets while children were out playing, prosecutor Jon Close told the court. Police patrols gave chase but the stolen Scenic mounted the pavement, narrowly missed a child and sped away, the judge heard. Patrols managed to stop the badly damaged car after it was spotted being driven recklessly again, but the occupants fled.  The car had to be written off and the mobility scooter was also damaged. Parkinson was arrested, charged and appeared before magistrates who released him on bail on June  - a decision described as astonishing by the judge because of his appalling criminal record. It was while on bail - and also on licence for another crime - he went on to commit more and worse crimes. Within three weeks of being released, on June , Parkinson was spotted at the wheel of a stolen Ford Fiesta which he drove at speeds topping mph around Tameside in an attempt to escape the law. The pursuit was captured by a dash camera mounted in the pursuing police car and the footage was played in court. It showed the Fiesta speeding in Ashton-under-Lyne but being forced to stop because a civic-minded HGV driver, who was coming from the opposite direction, used his vehicle to block any escape. PC Christopher Haxby is seen getting out of his patrol car to arrest the driver but Parkinson simply reverses, smashing the open door of the Fiesta into the officer, propelling the bobby onto the bonnet of his own vehicle.  The brave cop is seen to pick himself up, draw his Taser stun gun and order the occupants from the vehicle. He is heard shouting: Get out! Get on the f***ing floor now. Parkinson ran away but was arrested after a brief foot-chase, although he tried to claim during his police interview that he had not been the driver of the Fiesta. The damage caused to the police patrol car was estimated at pound,, while the stolen Fiesta required repairs costing pound,. The HGV had been damaged to the tune of pound,. PC Haxby suffered whiplash as well as injuries to his right leg and shoulder. He could have been killed, noted Judge Martin Savill. After brief details of Parkinsons criminal record were read out, the judge went on: That to me sums up this young mans approach to le. He couldnt care less. He associated with children rather than youths his own age, the court heard. The report describes him as effectively bringing himself up, said Mr Fireman.  Addressing the defendant, who appeared in court via video-link, Judge Savill said he accepted what the barrister said but added that there comes a time when the public has to be protected. This young mans record for one his age is so that it passes beyond the bounds of appalling, said Mr Fireman, while the judge noted that the defendant had unashamedly told probation workers he was unwilling to change. A judge slammed Parkinsons quite appalling criminal record. He sent Parkinson to a young offenders institution for four years and disqualied him from driving for five years. I can only hope this will offer you some cause to consider where your le is going, Judge Savill told him. But Parkinson appeared unconcerned, stretching and yawning loudly as the sentencing hearing drew to a close. How long did I get  How long gets taken off forremand and that  he asked an unseen official in the room at a detention centre where he is being held. Parkinson, of Ashton-under-Lyne, had pleaded guilty to two counts of disqualied driving, two counts of dangerous driving, twice breaching his criminal behaviour order, aggravated vehicle taking, assault causing actual bodily harm and driving without insurance.

Jordan Davidson, , says he was receiving pound a fortnight in Employment and Support Allowance at the start of the year before switching to Universal credit. He know receives just pound a month after claiming advances in payments at the start of his switch during a stint at a hostel in Birmingham. Jordan now says for the next fortnight he will have no money in his bank, forcing him to rely on soup kitchens and food banks, reports Hull Live. Speaking about how he survives on so little money, Jordan said: I’m just really starting to feel it now and it has been a mess since I started my claim.  “I was working but now I’ve got another two and a half weeks to go with not a penny in my bank account – and I’m not coping. “I’m not able to afford food and when I say I’ve got nothing, I mean I’ve got nothing. I’ve had to resort to begging, I’ve been homeless and I’ve had to steal sandwiches because I’ve had nothing when I’ve been at my lowest.” Jordan says he has no relationships with any of his family and was moved into foster care at the age of . He moved to Birmingham for a fresh start but was hit hard when he was forced to make the switch to Universal Credit sooner than he would have had to had he stayed in Hull. He managed to bag himself two jobs between April and September but when seasonal work at Haven in Flamborough came to an end he once again found himself homeless. Mr Davidson moved in with a relative in Hull, but after a huge bust-up he realised he had nowhere to turn until he was helped by Carl Simpson, founder of Raise The Roof Hull Homeless Project.  Mr Davidson said: “I couldn’t find a job that could accommodate my housing needs but now I’m living in a house share off Beverley Road which has been arranged by Carl.” Mr Simpson has also given Mr Davidson a job in his cafeacute in English Street, west Hull, but the struggling -year-old admits he still struggles with depression. “There has been some pretty low points for me this year,” Mr Davidson said. “I’ve been on my own and sat in a pub with nothing of my own to my name and nowhere to get money from. “I’ve got this new house that I want to make homely but I’ve got no money to be able to do that and I do get depressed from just being in my room. “I feel depressed all the time but I’ve had to keep telling myself I can’t let it bother me because otherwise things will all go downhill. Mr Davidson, who also worked at Hull Fair this year to gain some extra income, said during the period when he was in employment, the money he used to receive in Universal Credit was still deducted from his monthly wage because of the advances he had had. He thinks the controversial new benefits payment, which was created in a bid to streamline the system and replace six working age benefits, does not help claimants like him.  “The government are not looking at the reality of Universal Credit and how it can affect people. I don’t know others who have suffered in Hull because it hasn’t been fully rolled out here yet but it has hit people hard in places like Birmingham. “No one knows what they are doing,they should be doing this or that and what they should be getting. If the government could walk a day in anyone’s shoes on this benefit then you would see the pain it causes. It is just wrong.” There is a standard five-week wait for the first payment when you start claiming Universal Credit and Hull’s Britannia House is one of the final  Jobcentres in the country which is not launching the payment until November and December. Therefore, fears are growing in the city asyou start claiming at the end of November or midway through December, it is unlikely you will get your first payment before the New Year. Mr Simpson, who was keen to help Mr Davidson after learning about his plight, said: “It’s the gap from between the start of the claim and the payment which is causing problems and people are having to rely on foodbanks and soup kitchens.  “Some landlords are not as patient when it comes to rent and people can end up losing their properties. These people are trying their best to do what they can to better themselves and Jordan Is hard working but has very little support. “We are worried people will get hit hardest around Christmas time which is a time when people are trying to look after their households and just the worst time for this rollout to happen.” While it could not go into Mr Davidson’s specic situation, the DWP said the vast majority of Universal Credit claimants are paid in full time and on time and are also comfortable at managing their money. A spokesman said: “Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help. “Universal Creditreplaces an out-of-date, complex benefits system with clf edges that disincentivised work and often trapped people in unemployment. Under UC, evidence shows people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer.

In a panic, Melissa Whitchurch, , called the Department for Work and Pensions hotline but claim she was that it was her problem. Melissa and her partner Chris Steer were expecting a Universal Credit payment of pound to be paid into their bank account at midnight last Thursday and had budgeted accordingly. However, to the mum-of-ones horror, when she went to draw out the money, her balance was just  pence. Melissa claimed the officer said the payment was not due for another six days and, when she tried to explain the mistake, told her it was her problem and hung up.  The couple resorted to scouring their home to find things they could potentially sell so they could afford to feed their three-year-old daughter, Cheyanne. Melissa, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: All that was going through my mind was how am I going to feed my daughter and send her to school without her snacks  The children all put healthy food in a box at school in the morning, such as fruit and crackers, and then they sit down and eat it together during story time. It breaks my heart to think of her feeling like the odd one out, sat there watching everybody  eat their fruit when she doesnt have any. Melissa had originally asked the DWP to change her payment schedule from a monthly arrangement to a fortnightly one.  When the family received their last payment of pound, they were told the other half would arrive two weeks later and used the money to pay bills and buy food to last a fortnight. But when the second half did not arrive, Melissa was told it would be made on the last day of the month and was forced to wait six days with only  pence to her name. She said: Me and my partner can go without, but not our little girl. If we were told this in the first place, we would have budgeted for it. Its horrible. Cheyenne is really sweet about it and she doesnt really understand, thank goodness. We try to keep her away from it. But when she sees Im upset, she will come over and cuddle me and say its okay mummy. Its horrible and the people that are supposed to help just dont care. They are heartless.  The family have been surviving on food donations from strangers and neighbours who heard about their desperate situation. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  Melissa said: I could have gone to the food bank last week but since I thought I would be paid the next day, I didnt and the next one isnt for another week. So weve been getting by thanks to the kindness of other people. One lady heard about my situation and came and gave us some bread, milk, ham and cheese and Id never even seen or spoken to her before.  Melissa said she would love nothing more than toto work since she was signed off due to problems with her health  years ago. But the former shop assistant has limited mobility and has aids to help her around the house due to her back pain and other health issues, for which she takes more than  tablets per day.  Chris was also signed off from his job as a chef just five months ago for mental health reasons. Universal Credit is a new benefits system, introduced to simply and replace many existing benefits and tax credits and consists of a single, monthly benefit payment into a bank account. A DWP spokesperson said: “The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money. Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help. “Universal Creditreplaces an out-of-date, complex benefits system with clf edges that disincentivised work and often trapped people in unemployment.

That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":null,"title":"woman denies brandishing pole at dundee car wash and damaging office","story":"A woman allegedly assaulted two men at a Dundee car wash, brandished a pole at one of them, threw chairs at his car and damaged the company’s office.Leian Egbert, , of Keats Place, will stand trial on November .Egbert denies assaulting Christopher McDonald by seizing him by his clothing and attempting to punch him, at Aqua Car Wash, Strathmartine Road, on May  last year.She also denies assaulting Joshua Batchelor by seizing him by the throat, at the same location, on the same date.She further denies behaving aggressively by shouting, swearing and pursuing Mr McDonald, brandishing a vacuum extension pole, uttering threats of violence, and throwing two chairs at a car being driven by him.Egbert denies destroying or damaging the property of another by damaging walls, fixtures and fittings in an office at the car wash.And she further denies having an offensive weapon, namely a vacuum extension pole, again at Aqua Car Wash."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"end-of-british-summertime-when-do-the-clocks-go-back-this-month","story":"The end of British Summertime is officially approaching, which, despite the gloom, brings one positive development ndash an extra hour in bed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicole-scherzinger-speaks-out-after-telling-tess-daly-off-for-sitting-too-close-to-her","story":"Nicole Scherzinger has addressed speculation she had an awkward encounter with Tess Daly on Strictly Come Dancing."},{"url":null,"title":"equal-pay-women-praised-at-stuc-conference","story":"THE Glasgow Equal Pay strikers will speak at the st STUC Womens Conference in Dundee today."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-call-it-out-campaign-hosts-public-meeting","story":"A CAMPAIGN has been launched in Glasgow to tackleanti-Irish and anti-Catholic hate crime."},{"url":null,"title":"bellahouston-park-hospice-to-be-named-in-honour-of-sir-arnold-clark","story":"A NEW state-of-the-art hospice has opened its doors in Glasgows south side for the first time today - and will be named inhonour of a famous Scot."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-chef-john-quigley-cooking-up-festive-treats-for-christmas-event","story":"CELEBRITY chef John Quigley is leaving his award-winning Glasgow restaurant to share festive cooking tips at a popular Christmas event."},{"url":null,"title":"world-of-preservation-as-glasgow-museum-store-opens-up-its-doors","story":"These captivating behind-the-scenes pictures show a vast collection of , taxidermy animals at a museum resource centre."},{"url":null,"title":"ryan-christie-was-too-skinny-but-now-hes-man-enough-to-be-a-celtic-player","story":"BRENDAN Rodgers feared a gust of wind would be too strong an opponent for Ryan Christie when he first saw the Highlander."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-sisters-not-getting-a-penny-from-dads-estate-is-it-legal","story":"My Dad passed away, and among other things, my brother who dealt with the funeral and the insurance and money is saying that two of our sisters are not getting a penny of the estate.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

Buzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, revealed: “We are looking at a substantial investment in the venue and a major refurbishment. “It is now  years old and we haven’t carried out any work since the new bar five years ago. “Things are always changing in the hospitality game and you can never stand still. “Ultimately, everything has a sell-by date.” It’s understood that while the size of the venue will not change, its interior could alter dramatically.  Kenny added: “Nothing is set in stone at this stage. “In essence the only thing changing is larger toilets – there is no increase to the size of the building. “Everything  would be a redesign of the current layout. “A possible name change is among the ideas we are also considering.” The move comes as Buzzworks continues its rapid expansion across Scotland. Its newest Scotts restaurant has recently opened in South Queensferry, with another venue in Linlithgow just purchased by the company.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it. We need to provide cycle paths and safe walkways we need train services to be on time. If we can develop plans to provide these services then people will automatically select not to take the car, just as they will select electric vehicles as they become cheaper too.ldquoIt is about getting the message out and empowering people to be able to do it.The introduction of electric bin lorries would be a huge step towards improving the environment and changing public perception.Some such lorries are being trialled in England by waste recycling firms, with one company in Sheffield introducing two vehicles which are powered by burning non-recyclable rubbish as they collect it. Others are being tested using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe are actively working with partners to deliver one of the first fully electric refuse collection vehicles that would be powered through renewable energy currently generated on site at Kinwegar [recycling centre near

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them.

He had major announcements to make, on the abolition of PFI and a tax on digital companies to name but two, but these could have been delivered at any time.As a result, he sounded less like a Chancellor delivering a coherent Budget than a politician filling time before the main event. For once, we do not mean the next Tory leadership contest. The main event, the only event, last month, next month, and for the foreseeable future, is Brexit.When he did refer to the UK exiting the EU on March  next year it was to say he was putting slightly more money into the pot to deal with contingencies. The only nod to the enormity of what will soon be taking place was when he referred to the possibility of upgrading next yearrsquos Spring Statement to a ldquofull fiscal eventnecessary.In other words, should the UK look like it will crash out of the EU without a deal ndash good, bad, or middling ndash Mr Hammond may have to revise his plans entirely. How he squares this with promises that the spending increases announced yesterday will go ahead regardless of the Brexit deal is dficult to see. A no deal Brexit will change everything, utterly.Why, then, was Mr Hammond, and before him Theresa May, the Prime Minister, so keen to frame this as an end of austerity Budget  Mrs May had shown the way in her party conference speech when she said austerity ldquois over. Mr Hammond preferred to cast things slightly further into the future, saying austerity was coming to an end. Beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning, both were sending a message that after a decade of thorny times, a rosier era lay ahead.For those living with the consequences of austerity, all this talk of consigning the policy to history will seem like a joke in the poorest of taste. Such has been the extent of the cuts in public spending and the lack of real, consistent growth in wages, that it could take a generation at least until people are back to the position they were in ten years ago. Those at the sharp end of benefit changes and public spending cuts, happening here and now, have every right to wonder why anyone should be talking about an end to austerity when they are living with its effects day in, day out.Looked at from a dferent angle, this Budget did have clear aim. Its first, and least important purpose, was to show the Chancellor was still alive and well. For Mr Hammond, who has had more of a no profile lately than a low one, this was his chance to show that he remains a force to be reckoned with should the party war between hard Brexiters and Remainers take a turn for the even nastier. This weekrsquos Budget has allowed Mr Hammond to present himself as a man with a plan and this Government as an administration working towards an orderly and successful Brexit. The message to Conservative MPs is clear: do not wreck this. Stop fighting for a deal that is not there to be had, work with us on Brexit, and all of this economic bounty can be ours. More spending with no need for tax rises, the impossible made possible due to healthy economic growth, the kind that only a soft landing Brexit can achieve.Much rests on Mr Hammondrsquos growth hopes. Yet even with forecasts revised slightly upwards, UK growth remains modest. The Chancellor spoke yesterday of a ldquojobs miracle. What he really needs is a productivity miracle and this Budget does nothing to bring that about.But that is long-term thinking, andthis Budget was anything it was a short-term fix, one designed to keep the warring Tory tribes together for fear that something worse will come along: a Labour Government. Mr Hammond had a lot to offer there too, however. He spoke of the Prime Minister stealing a couple of rabbits out of his hat by announcing money for the NHS and a continued freeze on fuel duty. Just as she had ldquoborrowed from him, so Mr Hammond reached into Labourrsquos policy pocket and helped himself to a pledge to abolish the Private Finance Initiative and introduce a tax on digital behemoths. The most daring theft of all was declaring an end to austerity. If the Conservatives can do all that and maintain fiscal discipline, why would anyone want to take a chance of Labour getting into power Mr Hammond sat down yesterday with the cheers of Tory backbenchers ringing in his ears. He clearly does not believe the old saw about Budgets that are received well initially becoming the ones that soon fall apart. He is right to be confident, because in the cold light of day this will seem like a Budget written on the air, a statement laced with promises and predictions that might come true, and might not. If they do not, Mr Hammond will escape blame. It is enough, from his point of view, to point the way to the sunlit uplands. How the country gets there is down to others. He has done his bit.He passes the parcel back to Mrs May and the music plays on, a little tinnier than before."},{"url":null,"title":"historic-images-of-leith-reveal-the-port-in-its-heyday","story":"THEY show Edinburghrsquos historic Port of Leith as it once was hardworking and bustling with ships on their way to the four corners of the globe.And for campaigners currently arguing against the increasing redevelopment of the area, they will bring a pang of regret for a once buoyant industrial age and tight-knit community that has gradually disappeared.Hundreds of fascinating images of a lost way of le in the capitalrsquos increasingly gentried and redeveloped quarter of Leith were discovered in Edinburghrsquos Central and Leith libraries, tucked inside more than a dozen painstakingly compiled volumes spanning decades.They had been gathered by local historian, Dr James Scott Marshall, who displayed remarkable foresight by saving dozens of photographs, postcards and newspaper cuttings depicting daily le in what was once Edinburghrsquos gateway to the globe.The forgotten images include grainy black and white photographs showing clusters of steamers and sailing ships at berth on The Shore - today a tourist hotspot and home to Michelin star restaurants, shops and galleries.Many capture the people of the port going about their business, either working in the once thriving shipyards, enjoying a game of golf on Leith Links, proudly showing off their Clydesdale horses or outside their shops.Some will remind Leithers of what once was ndash and what is on the way: images include workers laying tram tracks to link the port with the city centre.Others provide a captivating glimpse of long-lost buildings and once packed sugar and whisky bond warehouses which once defined the historic port and are now either upmarket homes or offices.The eclectic assortment of images and ephemera provides a snapshot of social history thatrsquos a world away from the portrsquos modern hipster image, with its trendy cafes, Michelin star restaurants and tourist attractions.The collection has now been repaired and digitised to create Leith Miscellany, an online exhibition currently featuring on Edinburgh Libraries, Museums and Galleriesrsquo Capital Collections website.Clare Padgett, a library development leader who worked on the  plus images, said that while some are familiar images from the likes of pioneering photographer David Octavius Hill, others havenrsquot been previously seen and there are no details of where they came from or who took them.ldquoThe collection is really quite erse, she says. ldquoSome images had some information written alongside, but in others we really have had nothing to go on.ldquoThey were kept in shop-bought photograph albums, almost like a scrapbook, with postcards and photographs alongside press cuttings.ldquoDr Marshall was well known in Leith and had written many books about the portrsquos history. Itrsquos possible he kept this collection as a research tool.ldquoThese are images we really should treasure.Dr Marshall was born in Leith in , and became minister of Kirkgate Church in . He was regarded as an authority on the area, and went on to complete a doctorate on the portrsquos history.He later moved to St Andrews, and died in , aged .Yet even he might struggle to recognise some elements of the ancient port today, which have seen it propelled from one of Edinburghrsquos lower cost areas to one of its most desirable.Indeed, itrsquos so dferent, that some have argued its regeneration has gone too far, with claims that the once gritty area known for its sense of community and unique role on the fringe of the capital has become lsquogentriedrsquo, its historic assets stripped by property developers and leisure groups.Recent debate in the port has raged over suggestions that local people are being lsquopushed outrsquo of the area by rising prices and new developments.Last year a Scottish Government-backed study of the area raised concerns over rising property prices and the impact on local people whose families had lived in Leith for generations, attempting to remain.The study findings, along with a controversial poundm plan for hotel, student accommodation and leisure facilities on Leith Walk, sparked a Save Leith Walk campaign which has attracted backing from writer Irvine Welsh, The Proclaimers and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Campaigners last month presented a , signature to Edinburgh City Council claiming development of the area will damage local business and unravel the arearsquos heritage and community.Meanwhile, there are even plans for a National Lottery-funded play, provisionally entitled Displaced, which is expected to explore the impact of development on the area. It is due to be staged next summer, to coincide with theof tramworks to the area.The online exhibition includes several photographs of Leithrsquos old tram network as well as steam engines waiting for passengers at Leith Central Station, which closed in .Councillor Ian Perry, Councillor Ian Perry, Education, Children and Families Convener, said: ldquoThis is a most interesting collection of images from Leithrsquos rich and ied past, dating as far back as the th century, and sheds light on so many aspects of the arearsquos social history."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-women-on-banknotes-have-the-power-to-improve-society","story":"The bank is painfully aware of this, of course, to the extent that it has even floated the idea of ditching the RBS moniker in favour of something less ldquotarnished. While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBSrsquos ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its pound polymer note in , the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the pound version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue pound note.After nearly  years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just  years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.For too long the notes printed and distributed by banks have given the impression that that world is one where only men matter, or at least where only menrsquos achievements are worth taking note of. As journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez said when challenging the Bank of Englandrsquos  decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on its pound notes: ldquoAn all-male line-up on our banknotes sends out the damaging message that no woman has done anything important enough to appear.Our towns and cities are full of images and symbols of what countless men have achieved, with the naming of streets and chiselling of statues conferring Men of History status on them in the process. Women have not been afforded this luxury and, with some exceptions that remain woefully few and far between, their many achievements have gone unnoticed. This was highlighted by Willow Tea Room Trust chair Celia Sinclair when she said at the launch of the new RBS pound note that while Kate Cranston was an ldquoexcellent businesswoman who changed attitudes, in her day she really wasnrsquot all that unusual. ldquoThere were many women like Kate Cranston around at that time, but history simply doesnrsquot remember them, Ms Sinclair noted.That society has been able to forget those and countless other women is damaging because while it risks giving women the impression that they have nothing to live up to, it also perpetuates the myth still believed by some men that they simply havenrsquot achieved anything worth commemorating in the first place. All little girls need positive role models to give them the belief that they can grow up to be whatever they want to be, but it is just as important for equality that little boys know that women fulfil important roles too. I hadnrsquot realised quite how important until the day my then three-year-old son, who up until that point had only ever been seen by a female GP, couldnrsquot get his head round the fact the doctor we were off to see was going to be a man. Seeing is believing, though, and after that visit he took me at my word when I said that, just like women, men too can be anything they want to be.Which is why it is so important that Nan Shepherd, Mary Somerville and Kate Cranston, whose histories show what women can achieve in the arts, science and business worlds, have not just been commemorated but have been commemorated in a way that ensures all of us will come into contact with their images again and again and again. As RBSrsquos Scottish chair Malcolm Buchanan said when he unveiled the Kate Cranston pound last week, the bank feels that ldquoa banknotersquos value is more than just the figure printed across its front - it is our symbol, which lives in peoplersquos pockets and touches everyday lives.A statue in a part of a town that a fraction of us will visit or a portrait on a wall that only some of us will pass by is one thing, but an image on a note that will fall out of birthday cards and get passed from person to person as we go about our daily lives has the potential to have a far greater impact on our collective consciousness.RBSrsquos inclusion of women on its notes may have come at a time when banks in general are making plans for a cashless society, but there are still tens of millions of them in circulation and it is no exaggeration to say that in an incremental way the move will help to make society better for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-insists-chancellors-give-away-budget-not-precursor-to-snap-general-election","story":"The Chancellor used Mondays statement to announce a pound billion loosening of the purse-strings with income tax breaks for  million voters, help with business rates for the High Street, support for Universal Credit and the promise of increased public spending over the coming years.The package prompted speculation that the Conservative Government was preparing the way for a snap poll to provide the Prime Minister with a solid Commons majority as Brexit comes into effect in the spring.Asked at a press conference in Oslo ndash where she is attending the Northern Future Forum - whether or not she was planning to ask voters to go back to the polls, Mrs May responded emphatically: \"No. We are not preparing for another general election.

What we are preparing for is Britains future. Weve now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news.\"The Chancellor suggested that a good Brexit deal could trigger more tax cuts and increased public service spending.\"Because there will be a benefit to the economy from getting that deal, I hope we will be able to do a little bit better still than I set out yesterday, with a bit more money for public services when we have our spending review next year, and perhaps a bit more available going forward for some more tax cuts.\"His Labour Shadow John McDonnell claimed the Budget could indeed signal a general election ahead.He told ITVs Good Morning Britain: \"The Tories usually do this.

He has abandoned any idea of getting to budget balance by the mid-s.\"Mr Johnson said there were big increases in NHS spending over the coming years but \"he hasnt found any money\" for other public services.Mr Hammond responded by noting how the budget deficit would decline in every year of the forecast period and declared: \"We retain an ambition to balance the budget.\"He dismissed suggestions that he had chopped down the \"magic money tree\" and burnt the lot.The Chancellor told Today: \"You are painting a picture here that is designed to show that Im abandoning fiscal rectitude. Im not.\"He defended his decision to increase income-tax thresholds in a way which benefited the wealthy more than the worse-off.Many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, noted Mr Hammond, adding: \"Its important to raise all of these thresholds.One effect of raising the p higher rate of tax threshold from next year to pound, for middle earners south of the border means the tax dferentials between England and Scotland are growing as the Scottish Government introduces its own rates and bands.Derek Mackay, the Scottish Finance Secretary, is due to give his Budget in December. He argued that his changes earlier this year to the Scottish tax system, including introducing a new p starter rate, made income tax north of the border more progressive.But his Conservative opponents complained that Scotland was already the ldquohighest taxed part of the UK and insisted the case for more SNP tax rises in the Scottish Government forthcoming Budget was unsustainable.Asked about the widening gap on income tax between Scotland and England, the PMrsquos spokeswoman simply referred reporters to the Treasury.Askedthere was any concern that the dfering tax systems across the border were weakening the Union, she pointed to a range of measures in the Budget, which benefited all corners of the UK.The policies announced in Mr Hammonds third economic statement amounted to a poundbn loosening of the purse-strings over a six-year period.But the spectre of a no-deal Brexit hung over the -minute speech with the Office for Budget Responsibility warning that failure to reach agreement with Brussels would hit the economy hard.A disorderly Brexit \"could have severe short-term implications for the economy, the exchange rate, asset prices and the public finances\", warned the Governments independent forecaster. The scale would be very hard to predict, it noted, given the lack of precedent.\"Setting out his income tax cuts, the Chancellor not only mentioned the threshold rise for the higher rate of income tax but also said the personal allowance would rise to pound, from April . The changes had been due to come into force in .Mr Hammond said it would put \"pound in the pocket of a typical basic rate taxpayer\". The Treasury calculated the cumulative effect of increases in tax thresholds since  at pound, for basic rate payers and pound, for those paying the higher rate.The Chancellor set out a five-year plan

Health to pay for a pound.bn boost to NHS spending in England, while other departments see their budgets rise in line with inflation.Downing Street insisted the spending pledges were fully funded,

care that by giving out more loans that wersquore not simply adding to the debt burden on students as they graduate.ldquoWherever possible, bursaries and grants should be the Scottish Governmentrsquos preferred method of providing student support.The Scottish Labour Party highlighted figures which showed that, since , the average bursary payment has reduced by  per cent, while the average loan authorisation has increased by  per cent.Iain Gray, the partyrsquos education spokesman, said: ldquoToo much of the student support package is weighted towards loans rather than grants and bursaries.ldquoThe SNP once promised to end student debt, but for years now they have saddled the poorest students with the biggest debts.However, Richard Lochhead, the Higher Education Minister, said the Scottish Government was investing record amounts in student support.He said: ldquoAs a result, more students, including those from the most deprived backgrounds, are benefiting from free tuition and the maximum level of grant or bursary.The total amount authorised in loans was pound million in   at an average of pound, per student compared to pound, the previous year.Meanwhile, Edinburgh

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector. They say the closure of the toilets would have an environmental and economic impact. A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Wednesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118016.jpg","title":"Marathon trek pays off for charity","story":"A THURSO man has raised more than pound for charity by walking coast-to-coast across Scotland.Douglas Fraser decided to raise awareness of prostate cancer and raise money at the same time.\"As I enjoy walking I decided to do a coast-to-coast walk across Scotland and ask the public to donate money.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amPolice in Kirkwall are appealing for information following a traffic collision involving two vehicles in Stromness, which took place earlier this week.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

At the moment I am in touch with an old colleague who has done work like this in the past.\"It would be good to see the bridge reinstated, as it is a worthwhile amenity and opens up the walk around the town giving access to the bird le on the mud flats.\"Every week, the question is asked by somebody, lsquowhen will the bridge be reopenedrsquo and we would love to give them a date but for now all we can do is open a crowdfunding page to seewe can try and make it happen ourselves.\"Similarly, we need to raise funds for a survey on the MacDonald Monument. In order to try and open the to satisfy the Highland Councilrsquos many conditions for safe access.\"These are both long-running issues, whichthey came to fruition, would be assets to the town.\"The community council remains committed to seeing both of these projects through to completion and with the help of Highland Council and the local population we see no reason why this cannot be achieved.\"According to Mr Shepherd the plans are to replace a large part of the bridge with \"old recycled crane boom sections and hopefully, my contact can find some more to help out with the project to replace the old bridge over the canal.\"Fellow member of Dingwall Community Council, George Murray, said: \"There have been so many complaints regarding the bridge being closed that the issue has been constantly on the community council agenda.\"Itrsquos an important feature of the lsquoRound Dingwall walkrsquo and needs to be repaired and reopened.\"We have an area of scenic beauty that the public cannot access without walking along and crossing over the railway tracks.He added: \"Whilst I appreciate that the Highland Council seem to be having trouble funding anything outside of Inverness, this should not be a lsquobridge too farrsquo and we will be looking at all ways to fund the repair which could be helped by the Dingwall Common Good Fundpossible.\"Wednesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The move is believed to be a first in Scotland.“They refused to teach them because they’d been assaulted so many times”, said a school source. “There’s just no control.”The eight students are understood to have spent last week in a class together with seven pupil support assistants.“The headteacher told the teachers on Monday morning they weren’t allowed in the school. This is the first time this has ever happened in Scotland. A teacher has refused to teach one kid before but never eight,” added the school source.But an Edinburgh City Council source said the issue was a red line that was “discriminating against disabled children”. They added: “You cannot pick and choose which disabled children you provide a service for”.Union bosses are set to meet with education secretary John Swinney tomorrow about the situation, after negotiations with the council broke down.Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, labelled the council’s action as “one of the most disturbing cases I have ever experienced of an employer failing in its duty of care”.She said: “The teachers, and indeed other pupils at the school have, month after month, faced violent physical assaults, a constant stream of verbal abuse and threats and malicious allegations. Equipment has been smashed and classrooms trashed.“Rather than supporting the teachers to deal with these pupils, Edinburgh City Council instead has embarked on a campaign of aggressive and punitive actions towards the teachers, simply because they have dared to stand up for what is right.”Staff experienced with working with children with special needs have been brought in to cover the absentees. The council is appealing for the union to come back to the negotiation table and has written to parents to update them on the situation.A council spokesman said: “The council has been trying to engage with NASUWT at all levels to discuss any concerns they have and we are disappointed that they have failed to respond positively to date and decided on this course of action.“We cannot have a situation where staff decide who they are and who they are not willing to teach as this would be contrary to their terms of employment.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821833.1540908786!/image/image.jpg","title":"cameron wyllie teachers now are better than the past s real characters","story":"Modern teachers are, for the most part, much better than their counterparts  years ago despite the rose-tinted memories of many in middle age about their school days.According to our age, and thus our distance from the reality, our school days are viewed through lenses both distorted and coloured, often of a rosy tint. In particular, we memorialise our teachers, and we can end up eulogising people who we didn’t actually like very much at the time. Or, indeed, learn much from – the eccentric the easily erted the overly strict the ‘real character’. Time and time again, we hear people in middle age talking about how great their teachers were. I do it too – I became an English teacher because I was taught by a great English teacher, James Caw, now sadly gone – a clever, humane andwitty man, who indisputably changed the whole direction of my le and led me to a career that I loved .The truth of the matter, though, is that for all this sentiment, those of us who haven’t been schoolchildren for a while have to face the fact – teachers are a great deal better today than they were , ,  years ago. There are exceptions on both sides, but today’s teaching profession is just that – professional: better trained, better scrutinised and better organised. It’s much more dficult to get into teaching these days. In  when I graduated, I just walked into Moray House College to train – one application form did the trick. These days it’s a tough day’s interviewing, group work, assessments and you have to be better qualied to start with. In the later stages of my career, I watched lots of young teachers teach, just turning up in their classrooms unannounced to save them from buying fireworks. Almost without exception their lessons were painstakingly prepared, ied and thought through, and entirely relevant. : Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersI remember telling one young maths teacher thatshe had taught me, I would have been a maths teacher . Someone like me – dependent on telling lots of jokes, slapdash with my diary and not exactly up to speed with IT – wouldn’t cut the mustard these days, for all my passion and confidence. Nowhere is this truer than in the area now called the ‘expressive arts’. When, years ago, the powers that be decided that there were too many heads of department in schools, they invented a faculty system to save money which absolutely nobody liked. So the scientists, for example, were all lumped together, which to the layman might seem fine, but try telling a physicist that a biologist is now in charge! So art, music and drama were pushed into a boat and again that might seem sensible enough, but they had to put PE somewhere and so the PE teachers all climbed aboard So please think about the people who taught you these subjects years back. In my case, I was in a boys’ school, so while we got to do plays, there was no professional drama teaching, presumably on the grounds that drama was considered, in essence, an effeminate pursuit . However, in art, in music and in PE, there was, at least as I understand the word, not really any ‘teaching’ at all. In the art class of my youth we tried to draw things, and, to misquote Macbeth, “ we failed, we failed’. My art teacher in S was a young guy and he, sensing my hopelessness, used to sit and talk to me about pop music indeed he sold me some albums cheap. It might have been better, all things considered,he had explained why the people in my pictures all looked like balloons. : Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertI could sing, so music was better, where the kindly but ancient teacher went round the class of -year-olds saying “you can sing”, and “please stop singing” until he had the choir picked – those who couldn’t sing just sat and read. And, most parlous of all was PEwhere great kindness was shown towards me in my capacity as a skinny wee uncoordinated ... oh I don’t know what the word is. I remember once Mr Hastie, a very fine man, becoming exasperated during a game of rounders and shouting, “Wyllie, you don’t throw a ball like that!”, marching over and showing me how to hold the bloody thing which I then, of course, could throw from that point on. It was a rare momentof ... teaching.How times have changed. A few years ago in my capacity as a senior manager I was selected to “quality assure” the work of the PE department. I have no idea why. Anyway I found myself one brisk November day watching a group ofgirls being taught in the school playground. I was, I’m sure, unobserved in my observation, while they started off on a run, and then watched while the teacher, rather than standing smoking a fag like the teachers of my youth, ran beside the slowest girl, and encouraged her along, stopping with her to take a break, then took them inside and started coaching them in volleyball skills. What dferent days it could have been for those of us, as Janis Ian puts it, “whose names were never called, when choosing sides for basketball”. The same is true in art and in music, where the warm kindness of the teachers flows through the room while they teach the necessary skills to write a mazurka, or make a pot or design a dress or play a xylophone where talent is recognised and appreciated, but where the talentless at least learn something. And everyone does drama too! So today I take my hat offto teachers of the “expressive arts” – thank you for letting the children of Scotland express themselves. I wish you were teaching me half a century past.Cameron Wyllie publishes a blog called A House in Joppa©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4822120.1540971242!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon visits horrific legacy of auschwitz","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said the #horric crimes against humanity# seen during the Holocaust must never be forgotten during a visit to Auschwitz.The First Minister visited the Nazi concentration and death camp with Scottish students yesterday as part of the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Lessons from Auschwitz Project. It included a trip to Oświęcim, the town where the camp was located.This was followed by a visit to the former camp’s barracks and crematoria to witness the piles of belongings that were seized by the Nazis.They also spent time at the main killing centre of Birkenau where the day concluded with candle lighting and a period of reflection to remember the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust.“It is a privilege to join pupils from across Scotland on the Lessons from Auschwitz visit to Poland and experience first-hand with them the sites where horric crimes against humanity took place,” Ms Sturgeon said.“We must ensure the Holocaust is never forgotten.

He also said most islanders wanted the contract to go out to competition.The £ million, eight-year contract – principally Aberdeen-Kirkwall-Lerwick – will start in November next year.In April, Serco was awarded an -month extension to its contract, but it is understood this cannot be extended again.The Scottish Government’s Transport Scotland agency, which is running the contest, would not say how many other firms had expressed interest.Stena Line refused to comment, while PO said it had not lodged interest.A shortlist of those to be invited to submit bids is expected around the New Year.Orkney-based ferry expert Dr Alf Baird said CalMac could have the edge because it didn’t need to provide idends to private shareholders.The former professor of maritime business at Edinburgh Napier University said: “CalMac could offer a lower profit margin than Serco.”However, he said there was little scope for innovation because the existing ships would be used.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8685096.1540801538!/image/image.jpg","title":"super savings on discount day","story":"Forget Halloween and Christmas, there#s only date that needs to be in your diary this year and it#s the biggest and best shopping day in Ballymena.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”Eddie lts gym trophy\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
