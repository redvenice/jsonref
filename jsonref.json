In 2015, Wey, 46, was ordered to pay Bouveng $5.65million in punitive damages on sexual harassment, retaliation and defamation claims. Bouveng was pictured smiling as she walked out of court following the rulingWey also emailed Bouveng\u0027s father after finding her in bed with another man, according to the New York Post.The message read: \u0027I saw a six-foot-tall homeless black man named James lying on her bed.\u0027She said during the trial that she feared what Wey would do next after he \u0027started to harass and stalk me and my family and friends\u0027.She added: \u0027I don\u0027t want to be in the US right now because I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s going to do and I feel safer in Sweden.\u0027Wey has denied having sex with Bouveng, and his lawyers call her lawsuit \u0027extortion\u0027.The married financier portrayed her as an opportunist who bragged that her grandfather was the billionaire founder of an aluminum company when Wey first met her in the Hamptons in July 2013.Wey testified that Bouveng knew nothing about finance before he hired and began mentoring her. He claimed she betrayed his generosity by embracing a party-girl lifestyle that left her too exhausted to succeed.Wey\u0027s wife, Michaela, broke down in tears as she was questioned about the alleged affair in court.          A year after the trial ended, Bouveng accused Wey of publishing negative comments about her online, breaching their agreement          Their court ordered agreement said that Wey would have to pay Bouveng $10,000 for every negative tweet he published about her, and $50,000 for each time he tried to communicate with her, The New York Post reportedIn an exclusive interview with The Post days after the verdict, Bouveng branded Wey a \u0027psychopath\u0027 who tried to \u0027control and isolate her\u0027.\u0027He manipulated me, and he broke me down in various different ways.

Stock pictureThe price rag dealers pay for used clothes has climbed from about £220 a tonne in 2007 to about £500 a tonne today — and it’s an industry now worth £140 million.And rather than being unpicked and rewoven, as you might imagine, around half of old clothes you take to a charity shop or retailer are actually sold on — mainly in Eastern Europe and Africa.John Lewis says this is the case with its scheme: the bought-back clothes will either be resold or recycled, but the trial is at too early a stage to give expected percentages in each case.What’s more, charities say donations are falling in the face of this High Street competition, and that criminals are also being drawn to the high prices — there’s reports of donations being stolen.Many firms have sprung up offering to collect clothes door-to-door for free. Shipping them off to be sold isn’t the end of it, though.Alan Wheeler, director of the Textile Recycling Association, says: ‘Just because a retailer collects garments doesn’t mean the problem is solved. Where do they go?‘Typically clothes go through a sorting programme and maybe 50 per cent will be sold for export.‘The rest will need to be recycled: sometimes they are cut for wiping cloths, depending on the material, or they are used to manufacture heat and sound insulation or filling materials such as mattress or duvet fillings.‘Some textiles are used to make “shoddy”, a wool-substitute yarn which can make blankets used in relief work. Recycled fibres can also be used to manufacture the interior linings in cars.‘Even if the used clothing is of good enough quality to be reused, eventually it will wear out and have to be either recycled or disposed of.‘Of course, it would be much better to be able to recycle these worn out items, so it would be good if new garments were designed with recycling in mind.’And in terms of the plastics used in clothes, controversially Wheeler says that if the public turned against polyster in favour of cotton, it would only be swapping one big environmental problem for another.          India Sturgis with the clothes mountain at the Oxfam Wastewise recycling centre in Batley, West Yorkshire Conventional cotton production can cause huge environmental problems. It typically takes 20,000 litres of water to produce just one kilogram of cotton.Polyester — a synthetic man-made polymer and mostly non-biodegradable plastic — is used in 60 per cent of our garments. The most common is polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, which is the same plastic used in soft drink and ketchup bottles.In many respects, polyester’s popularity is a no-brainer. It’s cheap, lightweight, shape-retaining, easy to blend with other materials and long-lasting. Manufacturing techniques have become so sophisticated that it can now be spun finer than a human hair.Forget the rough, thick polyester shirts of old — some modern polyesters rival even the most expensive natural fibres in quality.Polyester or otherwise, what’s the best way to recycle your clothes?The new app reGAIN might offer consumers something different to the High Street take-back schemes. The idea is simple — choose a minimum of ten items to package in a cardboard box and use the app to locate your closest drop-off point.You receive a discount code from the partner of your choice to go towards your next purchase. Above all, Wheeler prefers the good old-fashioned method of taking clothes to the local charity shop — where the money they raise will go to good causes.But what happens to your bag of old clothes once you drop it off?Most of us do not appreciate what a massive and sophisticated operation lies behind your humble, High Street charity shop.I paid a visit to Oxfam’s colossal clothing sorting centre, a 90,000 sq ft former bed-making factory — bigger than a football pitch — on the fringes of Batley in Yorkshire, to find out.Here any excess clothing from its charity shops is sorted — and the complexity of dealing with our fast fashion habit is clear.On the morning I visit, the deliveries are rolling in. Endless steel conveyor belts send streams of black bin bags to workers who sort their contents by hand.Out come Hobbs dresses, M\u0026ampS cashmere cardigans, babies’ bibs, and old shirts and suits, which are flung into industrial wheelie bins for compressing and packing.The walls heave with hay-bale-sized bags of clothes stacked against them and there’s a smell of musty attic fibres in the air.Some 17 tonnes of clothing a day are sorted here. More than half is sent to Frip Ethique, the charity’s social enterprise project in Senegal providing work for 40 local men and women and stock for market traders.

Nothing — not one sock — gets sent to landfill.If items are too damp or dirty to process — around a minuscule 2 per cent of overall donations — they’re incinerated locally to produce energy for 400 Yorkshire homes.Despite this ingenuity, Lorraine Needham-Reid, the site’s manager of production, is still concerned about our wasteful attitude.‘I’m absolutely stunned by what people throw away,’ she says. ‘We see brand new items sent here, never worn, with tags still in. It is scary what people chuck out.’So what of the clothes we send to council recycling banks that are found on urban streets or in supermarket car parks?Sixty per cent is exported overseas for resale in second-hand clothing markets to countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Benin, Ghana and Togo.But this troubles Dr Andy Brooks, a lecturer in development geography at King’s College and author of Clothing Poverty, a book about fast fashion and the second-hand clothing sector.‘People think their old clothes are most likely to be sold in a local charity shop,’ he says. ‘However, there is a large international trade in used clothing that’s hidden from view.’‘Poor countries have had their markets flooded by second-hand garments.‘Factories in African countries including Ghana and Zambia have had to close down because they are uncompetitive.‘In the short term, cheap used clothing seems to be good for poor African consumers, but in the long term it harms their balance of trade and restricts industrial development.’So if recycling overseas is problematic when not overseen by an organisation such as Oxfam, and landfills equally so, could a beacon of hope be ‘fibre-to-fibre chemical recycling’ — essentially, making new garments out of old synthetic ones?Scientists have yet to find a workable method to magic synthetic clothing into new apparel — but the best attempt has so far come from outdoor clothing specialists Patagonia, who use PET clear plastic drinks bottles to make jackets, shorts and fleeces.But there are problems with taking that to the next stage, says Alan Wheeler.‘With polyester clothing you’ve got different dyes, you might have cotton threads within the item, it might have a nylon lining. Every item is different. Chemical recycling processes are looking at how to change all different polyester clothing into one homogenous product that can then be recycled easily.’ A move towards a circular clothing economy is something a few industry leaders are beginning to tentatively work towards.‘We need to slow down the amount we produce and encourage people to keep and use their clothes for longer,’ says Wheeler.‘The whole notion that celebrities and royals like the Duchess of Cambridge are radically “recycling” clothes when they’re spotted wearing the same item more than once is very frustrating. It should be considered normal practice,’ he adds.Wheeler points to the ‘elephant in the room’ when it comes to recycling and clothing retailers. ‘It is difficult for them to be sustainable because their survival is dependent on us buying more and more clothes,’ he says.‘I would argue that they need to encourage the public to buy less, pay more (that way they would pay their workers more, too) and design items that are made to last.’Currently consumer pressure for new garments means companies produce clothes faster to lower standards — which are then less able to withstand repeat wear.According to a recent report from WRAP, the average piece of clothing in the UK lasts for 3.3 years before being discarded.Other research puts the life of UK garments at 2.2 years.For a younger demographic, you can probably halve that. But the experts want us to do better than that.So it’s a case of step away from the shopping basket (literally or virtually), rewear what you already own, and recycle those you don’t — this way you save the planet as well as your pennies. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/08/4D4E9DEF00000578-5872247-image-m-2_1529651789590.jpg","title":"Higher quality clothes leading rise moth infestations Rentokil","story":"Britons buying higher-quality clothes made from natural materials such as wool and silk have led to a rise in moth infestations because they contain a protein called keratin (file photo: clothes moth)           Giant sex-hungry moths have been spotted across the country in recent weeks as adult moths emerge for the first time (pictured: giant moth spotted in Birkenhead)Jelly and I scream!

It lives a zigzag white mark on its leaves (pictured) and has now been found in the UK Elm leaf-feeding insects such as the rare white-letter hairstreak butterfly, which suffered in the 1970s due to the loss of trees to Dutch elm disease, could be hit by the new pest\u0027s arrival.While the zigzag elm sawfly rarely kills trees, large populations can completely defoliate elms, which could be disastrous for the white-letter hairstreak whose populations are sometimes restricted to single trees, the experts said.The first evidence of the pest in Britain was a chance discovery, according to scientists at RBGE.RBGE mycologist Dr Katherine Hayden said: \u0027Plant samples arrived here to be identified as part of local plant recording activity carried out by experienced amateurs in Surrey.Farewell Koko, the gorilla who proved animals CAN talk to us...Thousands pack Stonehenge to witness sunrise on the summer...Share this article\u0027Examination by our elm specialist revealed the curious zigzag feeding damage as the first evidence of the pest in Britain.\u0027RBGE science communicator Max Coleman said: \u0027The zigzag elm sawfly can quickly build up pest populations as females are able to reproduce asexually.\u0027People will be familiar with how fast greenfly can spread. The sawfly has evolved the same strategy: exploit the speed advantage of asexual reproduction and avoid the risk of not finding a mate.\u0027Scientists are now asking people to report sightings of the unmistakable zigzag pattern, to track the sawfly\u0027s spread and help scientists secure definitive evidence of its presence in the form of adult insects, larvae or pupae.It has also prompted renewed calls for action to protect the UK\u0027s woodlands and wildlife.          The discovery has raised concerns it could pose another blow to the UK\u0027s elms, which have already been devastated by Dutch elm disease, and threaten wildlife that rely on the treesDr Nick Atkinson, senior conservation advisor for the Woodland Trust, said: \u0027This could be another blow to the elm population, following the widespread devastation caused by Dutch elm disease, which began in the 1970s and continues even today.\u0027By continuing to allow the import of trees and other living materials we are risking the health of our natural landscapes and our own well-being as a consequence.\u0027Action is needed now. Government, with buy-in from the forestry and horticulture sectors, and even supermarkets that sell plants, need to help minimise further risks to our native trees and woodlands.\u0027The zigzag elm sawfly rarely kills elm trees alone but rids them of their leaves, which are needed for photosynthesis.This makes them far more vulnerable to being killed by other problems such as Dutch elm disease, which still exists in Britain. Because of Dutch elm disease, many of the surviving elm trees in Britain are young, which puts them at greater risk from the sawfly.At the last count in the 1990s, there were estimated to be roughly five million elm trees in Britain."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/09/4D8331BB00000578-5873259-image-a-9_1529656966754.jpg","title":"Dance like no ones watching Missouri cops release footage identify dancing thief","story":"    The \u0027dancing thief\u0027 was seen busting moves before an attempt to steal lottery tickets at a QuickTrip convenience store  She was seen lunging across the counter to grab rolls of scratch-off tickets which are \u0027worthless\u0027 if stolenFlorida liquor store worker \u0027caught trying to steal $600...Shameless woman \u0027finds a debit card in the street\u0027 then...Share this articleFox 2 reported that a ticket deemed stolen is \u0027worthless\u0027 and cannot be cashed in.A ticket\u0027s serial number could potentially help identify a suspect if they try to claim a prize. St. Louis County Police Department have arrested a 35-year-old woman in connection with the robbery.It is understood a QuickTrip employee helped identify the woman, as opposed to someone recognizing the dance moves.Sorry, this content is not available in your region."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/14/04DCF367000007D0-0-image-a-11_1529586781471.jpg","title":"UK holidaymakers face 50 visas travel EU Brexit","story":"    The EU has exemption deals for short-term visa with dozens of countries around the world.

Bates (Herbert Ernest Bates) was born in Rushden, Northamptonshire, in 1905.After grammar school, he joined the Northampton Chronicle at the age of 16 but realised it wasn\u0027t for him and left two months later.A two-year stint as a factory clerk followed, and then he began writing in earnest. His first novel was The Two Sisters - which led to him being fired from the factory when his boss found him working on it in company time.It was eventually published in 1926. Other shorts stories and novels would follow - many focusing on his love for the countryside.During the Second World War, he achieved acclaim after being commissioned to write stories for the RAF - including How Sleep the Brave (1943) and Fair Stood the Wind for France (1944).He would go on to write The Darling Buds of May in 1958, featuring the loveable Larkin family.The first part of his autobiography, The Vanished World, was published in 1969, and part two, The Blossoming World, in 1971 - three years before his death.

The designer horses are sometimes referred to as \u0027Disney\u0027 horses, because they look like animals from the cartoons (pictured) with their pulled-in noses and popping-out eyes          Miss Fowler examining a horse\u0027s mouth at work in WiganIn October last year an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face.The owners of the nine month old colt was said to resemble cartoon horses in Disney films Sleeping Beauty and Aladdin.Miss Fowler said: \u0027People seem to like these very dainty, pulled-in faces but that gives them breathing difficulties and dental problems. I\u0027m seeing these deformities on a weekly basis.\u0027One problem is there isn\u0027t enough space for their teeth because their mouths are smaller.          In October last year it emerged an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum (pictured) was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face          Example of extreme breeding, more usually seen in cats and dogs, can often be seen in the Arabian horse pedigree like Apalo, pictured, grandfather to El Rey Magnum\u0027As a result the teeth grow everywhere and, in some cases, they\u0027ll make a whole space of their own behind the oral cavity because they can\u0027t fit in their mouths.\u0027The x-ray from a horse I recently treated shows clearly that her teeth can\u0027t fit properly.\u0027One is sitting behind her oral cavity, another has twisted 90 degrees because it wouldn\u0027t fit.\u0027While human teeth are simple to extract, horse teeth can be anything from 8cm to 15cm long depending on the size of the horse. To extract a horse\u0027s tooth requires very big surgery.\u0027One pony I recently treated is not expected to live very long at all now and she\u0027s only six. Selective breeding can certainly decrease life expectancy.\u0027          Pedigree horses bred to have a concave face, pictured, has been described as ‘horrific’ by veterinary experts.Aside from the difficult situation of seeing their horse in pain, owners are often faced with bills reaching into the thousands due to the complexity of surgery.If surgery is needed it can be intense and \u0027massively risky\u0027 if the horse needs anaesthetic.Miss Fowler, who owns three horses herself, said: \u0027If a horse needs an operation the vet bills can be in the thousands. It is a much more serious procedure for horses than humans.\u0027Ethically vets have to decide what is best for the horse because surgery is massively invasive.\u0027Most owners decide they don\u0027t want to put their horses through it.\u0027Horses have a one in 100 chance of death from general anaesthetic, compared with humans who have a one in 100,000 chance.\u0027Any surgery is massively risky. It\u0027s very, very intense.\u0027She claims it is often a horse\u0027s failure to show pain, as it is taught in the wild, that means owners are oblivious to the level of pain or suffering they are going through.As a result, it can already be too late by the time they visit the vet.\u0027Usually the owners don\u0027t know their horses are in pain. Horses are prey animals - they don\u0027t show pain,\u0027 she said.\u0027It\u0027s astonishing how severe the problems can get before the horses show any signs of pain or weight loss.\u0027Pain is weakness in the wild and they would get eaten so often the problems are found when it is much too late to help the animal.\u0027When found early, the owners are very surprised to find their animal is in pain.\u0027The practice owner has now urged breeders to be more responsible, calling on them to consider functionality and what is best for the horse.Miss Fowler added: \u0027I think the focus needs to be on breeders as well as owners or buyers.\u0027The breeders pushing for the extreme features that are causing the health issues are certainly irresponsible.\u0027They breed for profit and create horses wanted for being pretty as opposed to functioning or healthy.

Stock pictureThe price rag dealers pay for used clothes has climbed from about £220 a tonne in 2007 to about £500 a tonne today — and it’s an industry now worth £140 million.And rather than being unpicked and rewoven, as you might imagine, around half of old clothes you take to a charity shop or retailer are actually sold on — mainly in Eastern Europe and Africa.John Lewis says this is the case with its scheme: the bought-back clothes will either be resold or recycled, but the trial is at too early a stage to give expected percentages in each case.What’s more, charities say donations are falling in the face of this High Street competition, and that criminals are also being drawn to the high prices — there’s reports of donations being stolen.Many firms have sprung up offering to collect clothes door-to-door for free. Shipping them off to be sold isn’t the end of it, though.Alan Wheeler, director of the Textile Recycling Association, says: ‘Just because a retailer collects garments doesn’t mean the problem is solved. Where do they go?‘Typically clothes go through a sorting programme and maybe 50 per cent will be sold for export.‘The rest will need to be recycled: sometimes they are cut for wiping cloths, depending on the material, or they are used to manufacture heat and sound insulation or filling materials such as mattress or duvet fillings.‘Some textiles are used to make “shoddy”, a wool-substitute yarn which can make blankets used in relief work. Recycled fibres can also be used to manufacture the interior linings in cars.‘Even if the used clothing is of good enough quality to be reused, eventually it will wear out and have to be either recycled or disposed of.‘Of course, it would be much better to be able to recycle these worn out items, so it would be good if new garments were designed with recycling in mind.’And in terms of the plastics used in clothes, controversially Wheeler says that if the public turned against polyster in favour of cotton, it would only be swapping one big environmental problem for another.          India Sturgis with the clothes mountain at the Oxfam Wastewise recycling centre in Batley, West Yorkshire Conventional cotton production can cause huge environmental problems. It typically takes 20,000 litres of water to produce just one kilogram of cotton.Polyester — a synthetic man-made polymer and mostly non-biodegradable plastic — is used in 60 per cent of our garments. The most common is polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, which is the same plastic used in soft drink and ketchup bottles.In many respects, polyester’s popularity is a no-brainer. It’s cheap, lightweight, shape-retaining, easy to blend with other materials and long-lasting. Manufacturing techniques have become so sophisticated that it can now be spun finer than a human hair.Forget the rough, thick polyester shirts of old — some modern polyesters rival even the most expensive natural fibres in quality.Polyester or otherwise, what’s the best way to recycle your clothes?The new app reGAIN might offer consumers something different to the High Street take-back schemes. The idea is simple — choose a minimum of ten items to package in a cardboard box and use the app to locate your closest drop-off point.You receive a discount code from the partner of your choice to go towards your next purchase. Above all, Wheeler prefers the good old-fashioned method of taking clothes to the local charity shop — where the money they raise will go to good causes.But what happens to your bag of old clothes once you drop it off?Most of us do not appreciate what a massive and sophisticated operation lies behind your humble, High Street charity shop.I paid a visit to Oxfam’s colossal clothing sorting centre, a 90,000 sq ft former bed-making factory — bigger than a football pitch — on the fringes of Batley in Yorkshire, to find out.Here any excess clothing from its charity shops is sorted — and the complexity of dealing with our fast fashion habit is clear.On the morning I visit, the deliveries are rolling in. Endless steel conveyor belts send streams of black bin bags to workers who sort their contents by hand.Out come Hobbs dresses, M\u0026ampS cashmere cardigans, babies’ bibs, and old shirts and suits, which are flung into industrial wheelie bins for compressing and packing.The walls heave with hay-bale-sized bags of clothes stacked against them and there’s a smell of musty attic fibres in the air.Some 17 tonnes of clothing a day are sorted here. More than half is sent to Frip Ethique, the charity’s social enterprise project in Senegal providing work for 40 local men and women and stock for market traders.

Nothing — not one sock — gets sent to landfill.If items are too damp or dirty to process — around a minuscule 2 per cent of overall donations — they’re incinerated locally to produce energy for 400 Yorkshire homes.Despite this ingenuity, Lorraine Needham-Reid, the site’s manager of production, is still concerned about our wasteful attitude.‘I’m absolutely stunned by what people throw away,’ she says. ‘We see brand new items sent here, never worn, with tags still in. It is scary what people chuck out.’So what of the clothes we send to council recycling banks that are found on urban streets or in supermarket car parks?Sixty per cent is exported overseas for resale in second-hand clothing markets to countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Benin, Ghana and Togo.But this troubles Dr Andy Brooks, a lecturer in development geography at King’s College and author of Clothing Poverty, a book about fast fashion and the second-hand clothing sector.‘People think their old clothes are most likely to be sold in a local charity shop,’ he says. ‘However, there is a large international trade in used clothing that’s hidden from view.’‘Poor countries have had their markets flooded by second-hand garments.‘Factories in African countries including Ghana and Zambia have had to close down because they are uncompetitive.‘In the short term, cheap used clothing seems to be good for poor African consumers, but in the long term it harms their balance of trade and restricts industrial development.’So if recycling overseas is problematic when not overseen by an organisation such as Oxfam, and landfills equally so, could a beacon of hope be ‘fibre-to-fibre chemical recycling’ — essentially, making new garments out of old synthetic ones?Scientists have yet to find a workable method to magic synthetic clothing into new apparel — but the best attempt has so far come from outdoor clothing specialists Patagonia, who use PET clear plastic drinks bottles to make jackets, shorts and fleeces.But there are problems with taking that to the next stage, says Alan Wheeler.‘With polyester clothing you’ve got different dyes, you might have cotton threads within the item, it might have a nylon lining. Every item is different. Chemical recycling processes are looking at how to change all different polyester clothing into one homogenous product that can then be recycled easily.’ A move towards a circular clothing economy is something a few industry leaders are beginning to tentatively work towards.‘We need to slow down the amount we produce and encourage people to keep and use their clothes for longer,’ says Wheeler.‘The whole notion that celebrities and royals like the Duchess of Cambridge are radically “recycling” clothes when they’re spotted wearing the same item more than once is very frustrating. It should be considered normal practice,’ he adds.Wheeler points to the ‘elephant in the room’ when it comes to recycling and clothing retailers. ‘It is difficult for them to be sustainable because their survival is dependent on us buying more and more clothes,’ he says.‘I would argue that they need to encourage the public to buy less, pay more (that way they would pay their workers more, too) and design items that are made to last.’Currently consumer pressure for new garments means companies produce clothes faster to lower standards — which are then less able to withstand repeat wear.According to a recent report from WRAP, the average piece of clothing in the UK lasts for 3.3 years before being discarded.Other research puts the life of UK garments at 2.2 years.For a younger demographic, you can probably halve that. But the experts want us to do better than that.So it’s a case of step away from the shopping basket (literally or virtually), rewear what you already own, and recycle those you don’t — this way you save the planet as well as your pennies. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/08/4D82D7CE00000578-5873237-image-a-12_1529651461080.jpg","title":"Londons Charing Cross station evacuated","story":"    Armed police attended Charing Cross this morning when it was reported that a man with an explosive device was on the tracks           Armed police rushed to Charing Cross station in the capital\u0027s centre this morning as a man claimed to have a bomb on the tracks     Police were called to Charing Cross station amid reports that a man on the tracks had a bombNetwork Rail said the mainline station, which caters for services arriving from the south east, was not evacuated, and arrivals and departures were not affected.   Passengers stuck on Northern Line trains faced huge delays to their journeys, as they were stuck on packed carriages waiting outside Charing Cross. Eyewitness Alan Buckingham tweeted: \u0027Loads of police including armed response at Charing Cross.

The designer horses are sometimes referred to as \u0027Disney\u0027 horses, because they look like animals from the cartoons (pictured) with their pulled-in noses and popping-out eyes          Miss Fowler examining a horse\u0027s mouth at work in WiganIn October last year an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face.The owners of the nine month old colt was said to resemble cartoon horses in Disney films Sleeping Beauty and Aladdin.Miss Fowler said: \u0027People seem to like these very dainty, pulled-in faces but that gives them breathing difficulties and dental problems. I\u0027m seeing these deformities on a weekly basis.\u0027One problem is there isn\u0027t enough space for their teeth because their mouths are smaller.          In October last year it emerged an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum (pictured) was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face          Example of extreme breeding, more usually seen in cats and dogs, can often be seen in the Arabian horse pedigree like Apalo, pictured, grandfather to El Rey Magnum\u0027As a result the teeth grow everywhere and, in some cases, they\u0027ll make a whole space of their own behind the oral cavity because they can\u0027t fit in their mouths.\u0027The x-ray from a horse I recently treated shows clearly that her teeth can\u0027t fit properly.\u0027One is sitting behind her oral cavity, another has twisted 90 degrees because it wouldn\u0027t fit.\u0027While human teeth are simple to extract, horse teeth can be anything from 8cm to 15cm long depending on the size of the horse. To extract a horse\u0027s tooth requires very big surgery.\u0027One pony I recently treated is not expected to live very long at all now and she\u0027s only six. Selective breeding can certainly decrease life expectancy.\u0027          Pedigree horses bred to have a concave face, pictured, has been described as ‘horrific’ by veterinary experts.Aside from the difficult situation of seeing their horse in pain, owners are often faced with bills reaching into the thousands due to the complexity of surgery.If surgery is needed it can be intense and \u0027massively risky\u0027 if the horse needs anaesthetic.Miss Fowler, who owns three horses herself, said: \u0027If a horse needs an operation the vet bills can be in the thousands. It is a much more serious procedure for horses than humans.\u0027Ethically vets have to decide what is best for the horse because surgery is massively invasive.\u0027Most owners decide they don\u0027t want to put their horses through it.\u0027Horses have a one in 100 chance of death from general anaesthetic, compared with humans who have a one in 100,000 chance.\u0027Any surgery is massively risky. It\u0027s very, very intense.\u0027She claims it is often a horse\u0027s failure to show pain, as it is taught in the wild, that means owners are oblivious to the level of pain or suffering they are going through.As a result, it can already be too late by the time they visit the vet.\u0027Usually the owners don\u0027t know their horses are in pain. Horses are prey animals - they don\u0027t show pain,\u0027 she said.\u0027It\u0027s astonishing how severe the problems can get before the horses show any signs of pain or weight loss.\u0027Pain is weakness in the wild and they would get eaten so often the problems are found when it is much too late to help the animal.\u0027When found early, the owners are very surprised to find their animal is in pain.\u0027The practice owner has now urged breeders to be more responsible, calling on them to consider functionality and what is best for the horse.Miss Fowler added: \u0027I think the focus needs to be on breeders as well as owners or buyers.\u0027The breeders pushing for the extreme features that are causing the health issues are certainly irresponsible.\u0027They breed for profit and create horses wanted for being pretty as opposed to functioning or healthy. That\u0027s the main source of the problem and it\u0027s definitely getting worse.\u0027But while dogs can live on a soft diet without teeth if need be, horses need to eat grass for up to 20 hours a day.\u0027People need to consider functionality and what is best for the horse. This is a massive problem in the horse world.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/11/4D83E06D00000578-5873791-image-a-48_1529664835678.jpg","title":"Historic 20 sided stone fort built Royal Marines base 16ft deep moat sale","story":"    A historic fort in Pembroke Dock, Wales,  is up for sale for £1.2m as the ultimate \u0027fixer-upper\u0027 - complete with a 16ft-deep moat          One section of the historic fort has already been turned into these large flats which have a homely feel to themThe Grade-II listed building is thought to be the last example of a square Bastian trace fortification in Europe.London¿s ¿Cheesegrater¿ tower, Tate St Ives and a touching...A house that\u0027s just Perfick!

People need it, he believes, and so do nations. Much of his fiction has reflected on the loss of an American sense of purpose, the decay of the dream much of his non-fiction has told the stories of immigrants to the US who have shown the drive and generosity missing from the country as a whole. In person, as in his work, Eggers combines an openness to describing darkness and tragedy with a faith in the essential goodness of “everyday people”. He tells me that “whenever there’s a moment when people are inspired to make the world better, I get interested. I’m super corny that way.”The most recent of Eggers’s many books is The Lifters, a magic realist tale written for eight- to 12-year-olds, in which the “adults have lost hope, lost their way, and it’s the kids who say: ‘Here’s the task, let’s get to it.’” The setting is a town that used to be proudly defined by what it manufactured, but has been gutted by sadness and loss of identity. Carousel is collapsing in on itself, with sinkholes appearing everywhere it is up to children – the “lifters” – to go underground and prop up its foundations, and those of other disconsolate places around the world.The Lifters begins with Gran, a boy new to Carousel and ignored by his classmates he runs into a brick wall just to prove he exists. The only friend he makes is the enigmatic Catalina Catalan, whom he follows into the woods and one night sees disappear into a hillside. “You went into the hill,” he said. “No I didn’t,” she said … “I saw a handle in your hand … I saw a stairway … And a huge room … It was lit up like a church”. “No it wasn’t.” When Gran eventually becomes a lifter himself, the two take a journey to a convention of tunnel-dwellers deep in the Earth’s mantle and confront a force known as “the Hollows”.Catalina was the first character in his mind, the author says. He wanted to capture her knowledge that “she is solely responsible for holding up everything above ground … I am obsessed with giving kids responsibility. We want to protect them, so we give them less and less to do, but they respond to having a task. I mean, I’m not arguing for child labour, but … ” He has talked of children as “heroes in waiting, they just want to be given the opportunity to prove it”.In saying this, Eggers is drawing on his experience with “all the kids I’ve met here”: across the road from where we are talking in San Francisco is 826 Valencia, the young writers’ centre he founded in 2002, which is fronted by a shop selling pirate supplies. He asked students at the centre, and its equivalents across the US, to read The Lifters at proof stage: “They are the purest readers, because they want to be entertained, but they will also point out errors, inconsistencies.” He took all their edits. They are also discerning, he says, grasping “the connection straight away between the Hollows and the mood of the town. Children get it at a bone level they generally know where there is pain in their house, and they speak about it candidly.”It sometimes seems as though Eggers is waging a one-man war against cynicism: both of the magazines with which he is associated, McSweeney’s and the Believer, were begun as responses to a more acerbic literary culture. Certainly, he is drawn to children’s sense of wonder, enthusiasm and fun. His mother (whose original name was McSweeney) was a “pre-school teacher … brilliant at knowing what kids really felt and liked”, and his teenage years were spent as a camp counsellor and running a sports camp: communicating to kids has been central to his life. Toph, the young brother the 21-year-old Eggers looked after following their parents’ deaths – as recounted in his career-making memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius – joined the camp when he was four. Eggers trained as an illustrator, and it has felt natural “circling back” to write the clutch of children’s books that have followed his work on the screenplay of Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are. There is, he continues, “no more fun you can have than writing a pure adventure story for the reader that you were at 10”.Eggers has said that, as a child, all he ever wore were grey and brown clothes that his own parents not once went out in the evening that his father drank and, like Gran’s, was sometimes out of work: “I can remember feeling responsible for my mother’s happiness.” Also, at school, there was his “ludicrous” name: I was Ham and Eggers,” he has recalled. “Egghead, Egg Beater. Eggs was the nicest way anyone would put it.” But he draws directly on only two personal experiences in his depiction of Gran: the excruciating time he wet himself at school, wearing khakis, and tried to cover it up at lunch by spilling milk over himself and “the game the boys had in fifth grade when we’d form a circle and take turns to kick each other in the head”.A very early image Eggers had in writing The Lifters was a “sinkhole in the middle of Gran’s school”. The symbolism is obvious: “This country makes no lasting commitment to education funding is woefully inadequate.” In the book, teachers simply work around the yawning hole in their building, as in life they adapt to insufficient money and just “reschedule a few classes … this is how we run our public education system. Spit and glue and ScotchTape, and no leadership from DC.”But before the sinkholes in his imagination were the hills. “I grew up in the flattest part of the country, the midwest,” he says. “And the landscape of my imagination was … stormy, grey, bright green hills.” Walking with his own two children (Eggers is married to the writer Vendela Vida) in just this kind of landscape north of his home in the Bay Area, he used to share a fantasy: “What if you had a handle and you could open up a door that led inside the hillside?” It’s a variation of such classic secret-door children’s fiction as the Narnia books, “The Pied Piper of Hamelin” and Coraline. When a few years ago he spent time in another hilly part of the country, rust-belt Pennsylvania, with its “crooked houses on the slopes, pawn shops and empty storefronts”, the narrative of The Lifters – in which purpose overcomes sadness to restore pride and identity – took shape.Eggers has long written about the decline of US manufacturing, not least in his novel A Hologram for the King (Tom Hanks starred as the dispossessed hero Alan Clay in the film adaptation), and is careful not to situate The Lifters specifically in the age of Trump. Finishing the story during the runup to the presidential election, however, he “couldn’t help” inserting the detail that one potential leader of Carousel campaigns on an imaginary threat from outsiders (in this case, the outsiders are moose). The opposing candidate runs on a platform of more cash for parks and schools.The election of Trump is “just absolutely crushing for anyone with an optimistic view of our citizenry,” Eggers says. This is especially the case as his understanding of American values is closely bound up with immigration. “It wasn’t until I moved to California,” in the early 1990s, “that I was able to appreciate how profoundly enriched I am, and we all are, by every new arrival … Our strength comes from our welcome and our identity as a haven and a blank canvas that anyone is free to paint on. And I’m enraged and offended by anyone who makes this into a fearful place. Maybe that’s a patriotic thing … I always picture Trump hiding under a table, because he’s afraid of everything: he’s afraid of Mexicans, Muslims, he’s afraid of change. He’s a deeply fearful human who has never acted courageously in his life.”“Any time immigrants are villainised, scapegoated or threatened,” he continues, “it’s an outrage. It comes from a cowardly place. You have a privileged 72-year-old white man who is villainising families from war-torn countries who are coming here for a better life – that’s pure ignorance, and it’s irrational and not strong and not American.”The day before we talk, Eggers has been organising an event with Valentino Deng, the Sudanese “Lost Boy” who found his way to the US, and whose traumatic experiences he channelled into What Is the What, a book Barack Obama advised every one of his White House aides to read. His second interview-based book to explore how outsiders remake America, Zeitoun, is the story of a Muslim house-painter from the Syrian town of Jableh, who helped the victims of Hurricane Katrina but was arrested as a terrorist. This year, Eggers published The Monk of Mokha, about the entrepreneur Mokhtar Alkhanshali, who narrowly escaped Yemen’s civil war, fleeing in a fishing boat with two cases of coffee. The stories of Abdulrahman Zeitoun and Alkhanshali turned out to be more complicated in real life, but Eggers says he is drawn to people, such as the latter, who are “so driven by an idea, and their ability to realise it, that they attract other humans to their light”.When dwelling on America’s loss of a clear sense of identity, Eggers often refers to the cancellation of the space shuttle programme. He has always been a space enthusiast and attended the final launch in 2011, an experience he tells me he found “very painful”. “Everyone was crying,” he has said: “The shuttle was such a powerful emblem of a sense of optimism and a can-do spirit.” The space programme finds a place in both A Hologram for the King and the less accomplished Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever?“It reminds me,” he says, “of what happened to the tobacco companies, which I covered as a journalist in the 1990s, where after a point nobody believed anything they said. If you smoked, you knew exactly what you were getting into – all the risks. You knew the companies were evil, but you did it because you were addicted. Well, people are addicted to social media. They know the companies are voraciously profit-driven and completely uninterested in privacy or any rights of the inidual. But they carry on using the tools because their friends are using them and there’s nothing better.“Facebook is still Facebook. It went through a little dip how many people deleted their accounts? People have a high tolerance for being surveilled. I think it will have to get even more poisonous and destructive before there’s a real change. Social media separates and isolates us … Any time you’re next to an actual human … you can find common ground. Humans in person are kind and giving and generous. But online, you see an inversion of every good quality … We are at our best in person.”The response of Eggers, who remains an untiring and inspiring literary activist, is to focus on personal stories. He mentions a young Ethiopian-American girl he has just encountered at one of the tutoring centres: “Any time you’re cynical about the world, meet a first-generation kid who writes about what she’s grateful for.” He admits he has found the last couple of years “crushing to a point when I do wake up paralysed sometimes” – and his next novel is “incredibly dark” he has been wading through “terrible footage and files”. But writing children’s stories has helped. Plus his belief in inidual drive and purpose is unwavering. “On this block,” he says, “I could introduce you to nine people whose stories would make interesting books … If you’re listening, the stories are never-ending” •• The Lifters is published by Scholastic.

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e994c6b4aced4b04e880aa4bbc6c8686b8a259/0_108_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abfa598e65617fadd7e44a08aab7a6f6","title":"bourbon levis prices rise eu enforces tariffs us","story":"Bourbon whiskey, Levi’s and Harley-Davidson on list as EU measures comes into forceDonald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing tariffs on European cars, after Brussels made good on its threat of retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi’s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Trump’s new threat comes after the EU imposed tariffs on a range of US consumer goods in response to steel and aluminium tariffs from the White House, which could increase the cost of consumer goods by £200m per year in the UK alone.Should Trump carry through the levy, it would have damaging consequences for jobs and economic growth on both sides of the atlantic. Leaders from both American and European car manufacturers have previously said such measures would lead to net job losses in the US.Shares in European and US carmakers fell, including Ford and General Motors, as well as Fiat, BMW and Daimler.The tariffs from Brussels imposedon consumer goods – designed to target producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support – were introduced from 11pm (BST) on Thursday on US goods worth up to €2.8bn (£2.5bn).The White House had refused to exempt its traditional allies from worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump argues are necessary to protect US jobs and industry. The president is also threatening China with tariffs worth up to $200bn over alleged “unfair” trading practices, amid increasing global tensions that could spiral into a full-scale trade war.The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, said this week the 28-nation bloc was left with no other choice but to impose tariffs of its own after the “unilateral and unjustified decision of the US”. Although American goods already in the UK will not increase in price, shipments leaving the US for Europe from Friday onwards will be charged the tariffs. Customs agents across the EU internal market of 500 million people will impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors.While the EU tax on imported goods in the UK will be collected by HMRC, with some of those duties staying within the country, the cost for importers, such as wholesale firms and supermarkets, will rise – and is likely to be passed on to consumers.Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, estimated the tariffs could add £200m to the cost of consumer goods in Britain.“Though the immediate effects on UK retailers might look relatively modest, it is worth paying close attention to this dispute because it’s future course is unpredictable, fast moving and could quickly escalate to engulf other, seemingly unrelated areas of trade,” he said.In 2017, consumers in the UK spent about £406bn on retail purchases.Most economists say the consequence of higher international import tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, offsetting much of the benefit of protecting domestic industries for the country imposing them.European consumers would be able to find “alternatives”, the European commission vice-president for trade, Jyrki Katainen, said.“If we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it’s because there are alternatives on the market. We don’t want to do anything that would harm consumers,” he said. “What’s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bdcdce3af4fa5d405fd44a244ae453b0606b221/16_66_5045_3026/master/5045.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac2e1a8fdf3013af37b47ab80f50cc01","title":"house of fraser to close 31 stores with 6000 job losses as cva approved","story":"The 169-year-old department store chain had faced going into administrationCreditors in House of Fraser have approved plans to close 31 of its 59 stores with the loss of up to 6,000 jobs.The 169-year old department store chain faced going into administration if its plan to shut stores and impose rent reductions on 10 other outlets was rejected. However, landlords and other creditors were furious at the move, with many of the stores owned by institutional investors. The meeting in central London included a one-hour presentation followed by more than two hours of questions from landlords and other creditors. Naissance Capital Real Estate, which owns House of Fraser’s Cardiff site, said the company faced a number of difficult questions but amendments to improve the terms offered to landlords were refused.House of Fraser said it would start working with landlords and other stakeholders to implement the proposals, including closing the 31 stores. The stores – which employ 2,000 House of Fraser staff and 4,000 in concessions – are expected to continue trading until early 2019.Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG and joint supervisor of the CVA, said: “The approval of these CVAs provides House of Fraser with the breathing space it needs to proceed with its proposed operational restructuring plan across a smaller core portfolio of stores.”However, Mark Williams, the president of landlord and retail body Revo, called for reform of the CVA system. He said: “The fact that House of Fraser is able to proceed with such a fiercely opposed CVA underlines that this legislation is completely broken and needs urgent review.“Action must be taken now and we have written to the housing, communities and local government select committee urging them to scrutinise the misuse of CVAs, holding retailers and their advisers to account by calling them to give evidence in front of this committee’s MPs.”Mark Fry of Begbies Traynor and Charlotte Coates of JLL, who have been working together to advise a group of landlords, said there could be a legal challenge. In a joint statement, they said: “It is disappointing that the CVA has been agreed without proper engagement with the landlords, many of whom manage the pensions and investments of the man in the street, despite them having so much at stake through the process.

Need to keep prices down!” the US president tweeted after the agreement.However, analysts and ministers said the actual amount of extra oil is likely to be around a third lower than the headline 1m figure.The oil cartel also failed to spell out how the extra production would be allocated among members, a key question as several have no capacity to pump more crude.Friday’s deal centres on how closely countries have stuck to production cuts that have been in effect since the start of 2017, driving a recovery in oil prices.Roger Diwan, a veteran Opec observer and analyst at IHS Markit, said: “That’s a fudge for sure.”He said the agreement paved the way for the Saudis to pump more, while the Iranians could sell the deal domestically by saying they had blocked a bigger increase.Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said the kingdom was ready to increase production.“Saudi Arabia is unique. All of our spare capacity is available at short notice,” he said. However, he said the impact of the increase would not be felt until the end of summer, because crude would take weeks to reach markets.The minister acknowledged that not all of the cartel’s members were in a position to increase output.Crisis-hit Venezuela has suffered a nosee in production, while Iran’s exports are due to be hit by US sanctions, so neither are in a position to increase supplies.Iran failed in its effort to shoehorn a coded criticism of the US into the Opec communique.Suhail al-Mazroui, the UAE energy minister and meeting’s president, suggested the agreement represented a good compromise.After nearly two years of relative unity at Opec as the group cut production to rebalance supply and demand, the talks in Vienna this week found the cartel ided.After arriving on Tuesday, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh threatened to veto any agreement to raise output, though he eventually reached agreement with his Saudi counterpart on Friday. Observers had said earlier in the week that, “the body language has been awful”.The Ecuadorean oil minister, Carlos Pérez, when asked if the talks had been fractious, said: “It’s been a difficult situation.” But he added the cartel hoped to continue its unity despite the disagreements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef466f132d79cc5354f26880d6d458633f8423cf/0_33_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ffe7247290a7c7570e7aea240f577f","title":"airbus brexit britain commonwealth plane wings north wales","story":"Forget Brexiteer fantasies: where in the Commonwealth will Liam Fox find buyers for plane wings made in north Wales? • Airbus plans UK job cuts amid fears of hard BrexitA few days ago, I wrote about how big businesses were no longer just frustrated with Theresa May and her Brexit bumblings. Instead, they were turning hostile. “Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.”Today’s announcement from Airbus is just the first of those body blows to the British economy. The aeroplane-making giant has said in public what it has been telling ministers and officials in private for months: if May’s government crashes out of the EU without a deal, it will be forced to “reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and its dependency on the UK”. Even an “orderly” Brexit, with all ducks in a carefully negotiated row, will cost the multinational billions in red tape and slower operations.At Broughton in north Wales, they’ve been making planes since world war two. Under Airbus, that plant teems with 6,000 staff, in an area that 40 years ago was pretty much stripped of its steel industry. If it loses that giant factory, the local economy will be back on the floor for decades.Some will doubtless point out the irony of the leave voters of north Wales now paying for their votes with their jobs. That is to ignore how many Airbus workers will be commuting into Broughton from around Liverpool. The potential ripples of this will spread far and wide, and they will last.After Margaret Thatcher delivered the mortal blow to British industry in the 1980s, she devastated those communities – and helped sow the seeds of the Brexit vote of 2016. We are once again back at the stage where decisions made in smart offices by company executives threaten economic and social collapse in areas that can still remember their last great economic disaster – and once again the political consequences are likely to remain with us for a long time to come.Of course, the government knows all this, because it produced an analysis of Brexit’s impact on aerospace as one of its 39 secret reports. These were the ones that were only made public after weeks of wrangling and published just days before Christmas.I went back this morning and looked at what clues the report contained for the fallout for Britain’s aviation industry. Aircraft, it solemnly declares, have “nose, fuselage, wings … and tail”. I looked up mention of Airbus. Like Boeing, the report says, Airbus has “the capability to design and manufacture large, civil passenger aircraft”. In other words, the aeroplane-maker makes planes. And so it rambles on for 19 pages. To call it a Wikipedia rip-off would be too kind, since the online encyclopedia costs the taxpayer nothing. Yet it’s what you might expect from a government that has always treated Brexit as more a matter of internal party discipline and less a real-world event with an actual hard deadline.This is not purely a Brexit story. It is also a reflection of the weakness of Britain’s economic model.What the Airbus story reveals again is that our political classes – from Holyrood to Westminster to Cardiff Bay – have made themselves supplicants for foreign investment. The result is that among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK comes second only to Ireland in its reliance on foreign-direct investment. Just like Dublin and its sweetheart deals for the likes of Apple, we have bribed our way into that position.Even while George Osborne was hacking back benefits for the working poor, he also brought down corporation tax to among the lowest in the world. The rationale was that this would make Britain more “competitive” and boost investment. Yet that policy was described this morning by his former adviser Lord Jim O’Neill as a comprehensive failure: “Investment spending has been very weak absolutely and relatively to many other countries. Despite this remarkable drop in ongoing corporation tax and rising profitability … it’s not done the job it’s supposed to do.”Not only that, we have handed billions to companies in order to get them to set up base here. Look at the Corporate Welfare Watch database, set up by Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York, and you can see that the Welsh government handed Airbus nearly £15m in direct grants between 2004 and 2007.Like Mexico, we are effectively a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world: we import components from other countries, then ships off parts to the continent or China or the US for them to be made into whole products. Trade secretary Liam Fox can jaw on about striking new trade deals, but he’ll be waiting a long time to find a buyer in Wellington or Canberra for the plane wings made in Broughton. And Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour can fret over not hurting the feelings of its leave-voting constituents, but it would be better off developing an industrial strategy that privileged local businesses and the everyday economy.Brexit Britain is a precarious business model coupled with throwback fantasies about buccaneering our way around the Commonwealth. It makes us easy prey for the likes of Airbus, which although profitable in this country has been exploring its options in Korea and elsewhere for a long time. Why would a European plane-maker cut jobs in France or Germany when it needs EU support against Donald Trump and Boeing? Far easier to cut back in Britain, with its cabinet at war, its economy drifting away from the European mainland, and its jar of corporate sweeties already heavily raided. In lots of other industries, lots of other companies will soon be arriving at the same conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95464bb110ac8318795eb4174486abd714fe3d0/107_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99e285ef91297ff717dbda1b1beecfc1","title":"sick mp vote politics westminster","story":"She came in a wheelchair, heavily dosed on morphine, clutching a cardboard bowl in case she was sick. The sight of the Labour MP Naz Shah voting in her pyjamas this week was, frankly, disturbing. What kind of workplace asks a woman to discharge herself from hospital for something she could have dealt with on the phone?The same one, of course, that expects Shah’s colleague Laura Pidcock to shuffle through the parliamentary lobbies despite being eight months pregnant, and in pain from the baby pressing on her sciatic nerve or an even more heavily pregnant Jo\u0026nbspSwinson to show up two days past her due date.If the exercise of democracy genuinely relied on ambulances decanting people into the Commons car park – as happened all too often when John Major had a knife-edge majority, and will happen again through the coming tight Brexit votes – then noble sacrifices might have to be made. But it doesn’t. There’s no earthly reason why sick MPs can’t follow the debate on TV and vote remotely, by proxy or even electronically. As with last week’s procedural nonsense over upskirting, all that stands in the way of a sensible solution is stubbornness, an exaggerated respect for tradition in some quarters, and fear of the reaction from a public too embittered to feel sympathy for any politician.That’s not the backlash parliament should be worried about. If the result of the EU referendum was in part a response to feeling ignored and excluded, then political culture needs to become less, not more, remote. And yet bogged down in the legal grind of Brexit, parliament has inadvertently done the opposite. And for the forces of reason to look ever more baffling and bureaucratic, while extremists perfect the art of creating movements that anyone can join in, feels downright dangerous.There is something so tired and stale now not just about parliament, but about our political culture more generally, and if someone as boringly middle-of-the-road as me feels it, then Lord knows what anyone under 30 thinks. Never mind being remote from ordinary lives: it’s out of step even with the political junkies.The Today programme is losing listeners as it struggles endlessly to digest Brexit. And regardless of who succeeds David Dimbleby on the BBC’s Question Time, it’s time for drastic surgery to the programme itself, which is currently lurching awkwardly between trying to recreate Twitter punch-ups live on air, and general irrelevance. The joke doing the rounds is that maybe we should put the audience on the panel and let the politicians yell at them – but in all seriousness, maybe there’s something in the idea of switching things around. Reading Aditya Chakrabortty’s account this week of a bold move to teach economics to ordinary people in Manchester made me wonder why the BBC doesn’t try something similar with politics: why can’t we watch audiences grappling live with policy problems, maybe in the process realising that it’s not as easy as it looks?But parliament too must do its bit. The general air of being trapped in the 19th century didn’t bother me when I went to work there back in 1997, because it was so clearly changing: female MPs flooding in, outdated sitting hours ripped up, sacred cows challenged.But the wave of reform unleashed in previous decades (much of which was about transparency – letting in the cameras, putting Hansard online, letting voters petition for things they wanted debated) has ground to a halt just as the fallout from Brexit should have been putting rocket boosters beneath it. Talk of moving parliament out of London, meanwhile, founders not just on the thorny question of who’d be paying for it, but because it’s what parliament does that needs to change – not just where it happens.Not all the traditions are outdated. The exaggerated courtliness that makes debates hard for outsiders to follow – the ban on MPs directly addressing each other by name, the ingenious euphemisms for forbidden insults – has always usefully lowered the temperature. It seems even more important now that MPs routinely face death threats outside the chamber.But millennials do their politics differently, which doesn’t just mean digitally there’s a hunger out there for something collective and social, which is why public meetings are back in vogue (even if post-millennial Generation Z likes to rebrand them as pop-up idea salons). Half the people crowing last week that Labour Live was an embarrassingly damp squib will doubtless be saying the same thing about Saturday’s march for a people’s vote on Brexit, but both movements have an energy about them that parliament is lacking. If nothing else, they meet a powerful need to come together and do something, share ideas, feel less like a passive victim caught up in scary times and more like a participant. Parliament can’t afford to be left behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66173ba32d7d67646f2b311fdf9fbff4c49c24a/0_0_1704_1704/master/1704.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e0cbdd2b2f8eab774eaa507e1c94709 480w","title":"gallianos first couture menswear show for margiela","story":"The designer went big on cowboy boots, tweed blazers and the spirit of Humphrey Bogart for a Paris show that addressed gender stereotypes Paris Fashion Week has become a week of firsts. Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton yesterday, Kim Jones at Dior Homme tomorrow and, in the middle of them, John Galliano’s first couture menswear show for Maison Margiela.Galliano doesn’t call it couture – speaking in a new Margiela podcast, released as the show started, he calls it “artisanal”. “We are trying to define what artisanal means for us,” he said. “It’s rooted in craftsmanship and is the highest form of dressmaking, but for men. Its backbone is in tailoring, but we are trying to further explore the bias cut.”The bias cut has been central to Galliano’s womenswear aesthetic since the mid-1980s and is something he has used in former roles at Givenchy, Christian Dior and his own-name label. It is not, however, often found in menswear. For those who don’t know what a bias cut is, Galliano went on to explain on the podcast. “If you had a napkin at home and you hold it like a square, and you pull the left and right sides simultaneously, that’s what is called straight of grain. Now turn that around to a diamond and pull the opposite corners – when you pull you will see what happens. There’s a natural elasticity in the fabric and that’s when you hit the true bias.”For this springsummer 2019 collection, which was staged at Margiela’s atelier in Paris, Galliano gave himself the task of cutting the bias not from his usual silk-backed crepe, like he would for women, but from English tweeds more in line with Savile Row suiting. They came in sculpted blazers, sweeping coats and satin suits. “It’s a never-ending learning process with the bias, because each fabric reacts differently … a dialogue develops and you have to be attentive because it’s alive,” he said. “It teaches you, you can’t read about it from a book … you are not forcing it to do anything, it tells you what to do.”Embroidered kimono jackets, long red plastic macs, bejewelled corsets and acidic vinyl trousers were noteworthy pieces from the rest of the collection, as was the cowboy boot, which was present in his collections for autumnwinter 2018 too.Galliano also revealed on that podcast that he works with his year-long student placements to put the looks together. “Their view of the world is completely different,” he said. “Of course, one understands it, but you can’t put yourself in those shoes, can you? You can only be alive around these people. As much as they are obsessed with what I do, I am obsessed with what they are thinking, so it’s an ongoing exchange.”Galliano intended to address gender stereotypes with this collection, to show that cutting skills could help “discover a new sensuality, a new sexuality”. He also revealed that he intended to show his womenswear and menswear collections together as of October. The 34 looks shown today were versions of ready-to-wear pieces that will be shown in three months’ time.Combining womenswear and menswear, Galliano explaining himself on the podcast and opening the doors to the brand’s atelier (so attendees could see the in-house designers working away as they entered), it all signalled an evolution for the notoriously anonymous brand and very private designer its deconstructed aesthetic code now infiltrates its processes too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba4259e7d6446fae25706e3b8360c4015284892/216_271_2661_1596/master/2661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e907ac8c05123c2cea10e053a42f419","title":"argentina football association world cup defeat","story":"In the aftermath of their humiliating, chaotic defeat against Croatia, the failures behind the scenes in Argentinian football have been laid bareOn 21 June 1978 Argentina’s World Cup defeat of Peru went down in history as one of the most controversial games ever. The goalfest and intelligent football that unfolded on that cold night in Rosario, as the wonderful Mario Kempes found his feet on his home turf of yesteryear, were eclipsed by allegations which kept conspiracy theorists and investigative journalists busy for years. Argentina, aware they needed to win by at least four goals to progress in their home tournament, triumphed 6-0 amid rumours that an exchange of grain between the countries had been brokered in the dressing room. They went on to lift the trophy.On 22 June 1986 a single Argentina player managed to surpass all that by scoring two goals, one with his hand and the other a stunning solo run that still ranks as one the best in history. Those few minutes on the pitch shifted the focus for ever and opened the gateways for further volumes poets, intellectuals, investigative journalists and conspiracy theorists would be occupied for 20 years more producing great works that only a muse of Maradonian proportions could inspire. Argentina went on to lift the World Cup again.Fast-forward to 21 June 2018. Argentina, having entered the World Cup with a small player widely regarded as the Goat – an unfortunate acronym for Greatest Of All Time – with the ghosts of these two tournaments weighing heavily on his shoulders, have all but disappeared. Ninety agonising minutes of a shambolic performance, featuring a completely absent and disconnected Lionel Messi and a terrible goalkeeping faux pas that sunk spirits on the pitch, opened the way for a worthy Croatia’s 3-0 win.The blame game and finger‑pointing started swiftly. Within an hour an audio file of Diego “Cholo” Simeone – purportedly having a private conversation with his Atlético Madrid assistant Germán “Mono” Burgos – was viral online. “But if you had to pick one for your team, who would you choose: Messi or Ronaldo?” his distinctive voice says.Jorge Sampaoli, who a year into the job has not fielded the same team twice, who has always proclaimed a love for a back three yet never until this fateful night deployed one, who has been repeating ad infinitum that what he was working towards was “connectivity” that would bring out the best Messi, had left the pitch insulted and insulting. “Smoke seller,” angry Argentina fans said.He assumed responsibility for the fiasco and said “the project failed” before, as if immediately aware that these words were digging a deeper grave, corrected himself: “The project of this game failed.”Minutes later a journalist confronted Sergio Agüero with a slight edit: “Sampaoli says the players didn’t adapt to the project.” Agüero looked startled. “He can say whatever he likes,” he uttered with a killer look in his eyes and walked off. By morning rumours of resignations and mutiny had been raised and denied several times.There is no sign the that Argentinian Football Association can steer the path to a brighter future. For the past four years it has talked of rebuilding, restructuring and reforming but all it has managed to do is repeat, relive and reinforce the worst traits and attitudes. Perhaps most damagingly, it opened bids for a youth training project and chose one that was not even part of the bidding contest. Until 15 years ago the country had boasted, for the better part of a century, some of the best and most progressive child and adolescent development traditions in world football. That has been obliterated.The squad that had to perform to the tune of that shambolic backdrop consisted mostly of the last standing warriors of a bygone generation, and a few novices whose first taste of representing the country was being thrown to the wolves without any sensible preparation. And Messi, whose block was total.It was clear as the national anthem played that something else was on Messi’s mind. He looked down and scratched his forehead, as if trying to remove something from his head. After that he was largely absent. The superlative Croatia midfielder Luka Modric was generous in the mixed zone: “Messi is an incredible player but in football you need help from the team. We were able to close down spaces and stop Mascherano and other players from passing to him. He is a great, great player but he can’t do everything alone.” Sampaoli also tried in vain to detract fault from Messi.“Yes, yes! Yes, I want Messi to do it!” one deranged pundit on Argentinian TV screamed at the camera, banging on the table. “You, Messi: I want you to do it! I’m asking you!” he continued.If football is escapism and the fans were hoping to forget the torrid times of rising unemployment and galloping devaluation for a few minutes, the project has most certainly failed.If football is a game of beauty and entertainment to be enjoyed by players and observers alike, the project has most certainly failed. It was painful to watch, not only for Argentinians, and those young men who took to the pitch were definitely not enjoying it. In fact, their suffering was palpable. If football is a war game, a strategic proposal to defeat an adversary through carefully rehearsed combat manoeuvres, a tactically weak and psychologically frail Argentina did not achieve this: the project has failed.It is as if the doors of perception have been opened and everything is finally presented before us as it is. A circus with bitter clowns, no safety net under the trapeze, a malnourished caged tiger and a knife-thrower who aims at the heart of his side-kick. The lady in the box is sawn in half and the chained man in the glass box of water is not even trying to break free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e8cafa383aa426facb4f7a37f40be50053fe0a/2_74_4436_2662/master/4436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b713f8a7ab72bb6e406d46c0c3c91ca4","title":"brazil costa rica philippe coutinho world cup group e match report","story":"Well, that was late and indeed a little ugly at times. On a breezy afternoon by the Gulf of Finland Brazil beat Costa Rica 2-0 at the St\u0026nbspPetersburg Stadium to ease their route towards the knockout stage of Russia 2018.The goals were both scored in injury time, the first by their best player on the day Philippe Coutinho, who came haring through a crowd on to a touch from Gabriel Jesus to poke the ball through the legs of Keylor Navas and send the yellow-shirted stands into a fever.As the clock ticked down Neymar added a second, the Costa Rica defence finally parting after some fine, dogged efforts. Brazil’s captain celebrated like a World Cup winner after stabbing the ball into the net from Douglas Costa’s cross. And it was an eventful day all round for Neymar, who grumbled and moaned and threw himself to the floor, and might have been sent off in the second half for a combination of dissent and ing.At the final whistle the world’s costliest player could be seen weeping dramatically on the pitch, shoulders shuddering, hands shielding his visage from the world. Indeed.Brazil have four points in Group\u0026nbspE. A draw with Serbia will guarantee progress. This game will be remembered for Coutinho’s fine driving efforts in central midfield and for some well-timed substitutions by Tite. But it will also be coloured by Neymar’s preposterous antics, and for a sense of lost focus at various stages.A turning point seemed to have arrived around the hour mark as the referee Björn Kuipers of the Netherlands, finally snapped. As Brazil defended a corner Kuipers could be seen telling Brazil’s captain to be quiet in the way an exasperated father might\u0026nbspspeak to a sullen and spoiled teenager.Seventeen minutes later Kuipers was finally beaten into submission. No doubt it wears you down. As Giancarlo González brushed the Neymar abdomen with his hand Brazil’s captain toppled backwards in ludicrous fashion, a dying sapling swept away by a mudslide. Kuipers gave the penalty. Neymar lay on the floor being nursed by his teammates, as though finally\u0026nbspvictorious in his battle with injustice.Out of his sight Kuipers trotted off, looked at the VAR screen, and reversed the decision. He should also have booked Neymar for cheating. But well-played Mr Kuipers. A penalty would have been reward for superstar strops and generally graceless behaviour. A Brazil World campaign is a notch in the nation’s pop-cultural history. It deserves better than this.This World Cup has been waiting for a statement performance, for one of the more celebrated teams to decide that in fact this tournament is there for the taking if somebody can get the thrusters lined up. This wasn’t it from Brazil, at least not for the opening 85 minutes.Hopes had been high at kick-off. The stadium in St Petersburg is a stunning thing with a roof fanned out around steel girders of dizzying scale, ranged above the pitch like an iron giant cradling his fingers.Brazil did press hard at the start, Coutinho shooting just over after Bryan Ruiz had given him the ball.\u0026nbspAfter which, the congealment. The blue shirts were slow through midfield, a porridge of sideways passing. It was Costa Rica who should have taken the lead on 12 minutes, as Celso Borges shot low and hard but past the left-hand post from a cut-back from\u0026nbspRuiz.Neymar began to intrude, writhing and leaping at every challenge. He is targeted for rough treatment but he invites it too, never once hiding his disgust and his distraction.Again he went down, this time after “putting a hat on” Cristian Gamboa (nicking the ball over his head) a terrible humiliation in Brazilian football. Again there were chunterings to the referee, constant close-ups of that pained Neymar face. This is a different player right now to the sprightly warrior of 2014, transformed into a mardy drama magnet. Life moves pretty fast, Neymar old boy. If you don’t stop rolling around once in awhile, you could miss it.As the teams penetrated the dressing rooms at half-time Neymar approached the referee and prattled on some more. Clearly he has rushed his way back to this tournament. But he doesn’t deal with rustiness well. And he was overshadowed by Coutinho here, who was the hub of the team and who should be given as much leverage as he likes to make the game up in front of him.Tite took off Willian at half-time and put on the more direct Douglas Costa. Suddenly Brazil were surging forward, Gabriel Jesus heading powerfully on to the bar from a Douglas cross. The ball bounced out to Coutinho whose shot\u0026nbspwas deflected just wide by Gamboa.Tite twisted again, bringing on Roberto Firmino for Paulinho. Neymar shot wide of the post on the run with space in front of him. And moments late he was finally booked, this time for a pathetic hissy fit after a foul. Two late goals disguised a distracted performance that improved as the tempo rose but Tite will have plenty to ponder from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/142ef50ad5601a600d77b27167d628a92a9194d0/182_241_1442_865/master/1442.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15226d6ad511b9d9107056568fa1ad1a","title":"england steve holland apologises panama world cup gareth southgate","story":"The England assistant manager Steve Holland has apologised to the squad for inadvertently appearing to reveal Gareth Southgate’s proposed lineup for Sunday’s World Cup Group G fixture against Panama.Holland had been photographed walking on to the training pitch for Thursday’s session at Spartak Zelenogorsk’s stadium clutching a sheet of paper upon which seemed to be written the starting XI for the game in Nizhny Novgorod. On it, Southgate’s first-choice selection, which included Marcus Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, appeared to be detailed in formation with each player’s understudy listed underneath.Although the Football Association was apparently relaxed about the situation, the England defender Kyle Walker said that Holland had felt moved to address the squad before their session back in Zelenogorsk on Friday morning.“It was just before training, just before we went out and did our warm-up,” he said. “He gave his apologies and said it was the first time he had messed up in 20 years, which we had a bit of a laugh about because his refereeing skills are not great. It was a bit of banter, we move on and are looking forward to the game now.”Asked about the images of Holland’s team-sheet, Southgate said: “It doesn’t bother me in the slightest. There’s a squad of 23 names on the sheet, the next sheet has different players in different positions because we swap people in and swap people out. The stories are then run as they are. For me, no drama, but obviously any time we were to give the opposition the opportunity of having our team is a disadvantage to us and so, of course, our media has to decide whether they want to help the team or not. But, given that was just a squad list, it doesn’t make any difference really.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9167c0fb170b9814fd7879f4fc15a2c3040ed73/0_0_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b4c39a1e5c9b2a0d4f3e594f82a25a","title":"faces of the world cup fans from around the world show their colours","story":"Whether you support Senegal or Switzerland, the World Cup is a great excuse to get out the face paint or lion mask and display your patriotic pride"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aada115ea1f5b6f04f2e7d5f612e6aff6ea4968/0_1_1910_1146/master/1910.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6794602ee803507b955162432fa99a1","title":"brazil costa rica world cup 2018 live","story":"Brazil left it late before knocking Costa Rica out of the World Cup thanks to goals from Philippe Coutinho and NeymarThe next game of the day is Nigeria v Iceland in Group D.

Let’s go to VAR to see if it was a e.ITV’s pictures show that Neymar had a word with Bjorn Kuipers in the tunnel at half-time. The Dutch referee told him to do one and eventually booked the Brazilian for dissent in the second half.If anything sums up Brazil’s performance, it’s Tite falling over and doing a terrible somersault after Coutinho’s goal. It was a messy offering. They were better in the second half, though, and created more than enough chances. It’s something for them to build on and they will be tough to stop if they develop more cohesion. Whether that’s possible is likely to be down to Neymar, who will probably get some flak for breaking down in tears after a late win over Costa Rica. He was maddening at times today but it’s to his credit that he never stopped trying and he got his goal in the end. Teams will continue to target him, though, and it’s difficult to know if this is going to have a happy ending. The way Neymar behaved with Bjorn Kuipers, the referee, isn’t a good sign.Get your match report here!Brazil go top of Group E with four points after two games – Serbia and Switzerland meet at 7pm BST this evening. Costa Rica are out after losing their first two matches. They put up a spirited fight and defended so well, but ultimately they’ve shown nothing in attack in either of their outings and won’t be missed.That’s your lot! Costa Rica are out, Neymar is in tears, Brazil have their first win of the 2018 World Cup! But didn’t they make hard work of it?With Costa Rica absolutely knackered, Casmeiro released Costa on the right. He played it across for Neymar to volley into an empty net! Cue bedlam.Neymar has the last word. It’s all over.90 min+6: Marcelo’s cross is put behind for a Brazil corner. It’s hard to see Costa Rica equalising. They haven’t had an attack since Coutinho’s goal.90 min+4: Firmino and Coutinho fans combine on the left, making Liverpool fans feel all nostalgic. Coutinho flicks the ball back to Firmino, who blazes over from close range!Marcelo sends in a deep cross from the right. Firmino, who has been quiet, heads it back into the middle. Jesus miscontrols but the ball runs loose and Coutinho, just like Steven Gerrard, powers in to stab a shot under Keylor Navas from close range! Brazil have the breakthrough and celebrate with a massive bundle in the corner.90 min: There will be a minimum of six added minutes.89 min: Neymar crosses. Navas punches. Then he goes down. Play’s stopped again. The Brazilian fans howl.88 min: Neymar collides with Duerte, who goes down clutching his head. It’s a Brazil free-kick. Play’s delayed. Marcelo clashes with Acosta, who falls over as well. Neymar’s annoyed. He needs to be careful not to pick up a second booking.87 min: Costa tees up Casemiro, who slides a shot straight at Navas from 25 yards.86 min: Costa knocks a pass to Casemiro, who finds Jesus in the area. The striker’s crowded out by three Costa Rica defenders.85 min: Coutinho curls a shot straight at Navas from 30 yards.84 min: Yeltsin Tejeda replaces Guzman. Costa Rica have used up all their changes and they’re wasting a lot of time. Acosta’s booked for taking too long over a throw.83 min: Another replay of the penalty decision shows it was a pretty ridiculous e from Neymar, who threw himself backwards when Gonzalez’s arm was no longer on his body.82 min: I think Coutinho was also booked for dissent. This is great entertainment. It’s been a wild ride of a second half. Costa Rica aren’t out of the woods yet. I still think Brazil will push through.81 min: Acosta goes down injured. Play’s delayed. Neymar, still furious, throws the ball to the ground in a moment of petulance and finally picks up the booking for dissent that’s been coming since the first whistle. 80 min: And to think some people don’t enjoy VAR.79 min: Bjorn Kuipers runs to the side of the pitch, has a look at the screen, runs back to the Costa Rica area and overturns his decision! He’s decided that there wasn’t sufficient contact on Neymar! Brazil can’t believe it. Neymar’s day gets worse.79 min: It was a very soft fall from Neymar. There wasn’t loads of contact from Gonzalez. The referee is having a look.78 min: Brazil power through the middle. Costa finds Jesus, who shuffles the ball to Neymar. He’s clear on the left but he decides to try one more trick and cut back inside. Gonzalez leans in, puts his arm on Neymar and a penalty’s awarded!77 min: Coutinho spins a cross into the middle. There’s Navas.76 min: Neymar meets Acosta for the first time. He tries to slither a shot through the defender’s legs and into the far corner, but Acosta deflects it wide.75 min: Francisco Calvo replaces Christian Gamboa, who relished his battle with Neymar. Acosta moves to right wing-back.72 min: Brazil break and Coutinho tries to release Jesus. Gamboa steps in but his intervention inadvertently sends Neymar away. He zips inside, opens up his body and curls the ball high and wide from 20 yards, with only Navas to beat.70 min: Casemiro’s cross from the right is deflected behind for another corner.

Musa picks up the ball on the edge of the Iceland penalty area and rattles the bar with a curling shot.73 min: Iceland substitution from a couple of minutes ago: Jon Bodvarsson off to be replaced by Bjorn Sigurdarson.71 min: Another Nigeria corner. Balogun leaps highest and sends a header a couple of feet over the bar.70 min: Nigeria take a corner, but Etebo’s delivery is cleared. The ball is crossed into the penalty area, where Balogun stoops to head well wide. 68 min: Victor Moses glides up the right flank, with Musa and Iheanacho in support. He attempts to drill the ball into the penalty area, but his effort is blocked. Iceland clear their lines.66 min: A poor first touch for Jon Bodvarsson sees the Icelandic forward run the ball out of play on the far touchline as he tries to take it around a defender. He waves an apology in the direction of Gylfi Sigurdsson, who was hoping for a cross. 64 min: Iceland substitution: Ragnar Sigurdsson succumbs to the head injury he sustained as Ahmed Musa scored for Nigeria and is replaced by Sverrir Ingason.63 min: Free-kick for Iceland about 35 yards from the Nigeria goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson floats the ball straight into the hands of Nigeria’s 19-year-old goalkeeper Francis Uzoho.60 min: This is match No25 of this World Cup and Ahmed Musa’s goal means we still haven’t had a goalless draw. That’s quite remarkable ... particularly as I think I read somewhere that in terms of goals per game, this is lowest scoring World Cup of all time ... so far.59 min: Iceland corner. Gylfi Sigurdsson sends the ball into the Nigeria penalty area, where Victor Moses hacks it clear.58 min: Saevarsson crosses from the right touchline, but his delivery is cleared. Moments later, Iceland get another delivery into the Nigeria penalty area, but Leon Balogun clears well. In the stands, the Iceland fans begin another thunderclap in a bid to rally their team.56 min: It’s all Nigeria at the moment and Halldorsson is forced to tip a speculative Wilf Ndidi shot from distance over the bar for a corner. That was dipping in.55 min: Argentina’s players will have been cheered up by that Nigerian goal. A win for Iceland in this match would leave them in even more bother than they find themselves already.53 min: Sigurdsson is patched up by Iceland’s medics and will resume playing in a clean shirt, with an arresting pink bandage wrapped Terry Butcher-style around his head. 51 min: Ragnar Sigurdsson took an accidental knee to the back of the head as he attempted to block that shot from Musa and is currently receiving treatment. He seems to be bleeding quite heavily from the wound on the back of his head. 49 min: That was a terrific goal from Ahmed Musa. From an Iceland long-throw at the far end of the pitch, Nigeria cleared and galloped upfield on the break. Victor Moses sprinted up the inside right, before curling a cross towards the near post. Up in support, Musa controlled the ball with a wonderful first touch and slammed it past Halldorsson on the half volley.Nigeria break on the counter and Ahmed Musa fires them into the lead on the half-volley.47 min: A long diagonal from Iceland and Bodvarsson tries to head the ball down for Gylfi Sigurdsson. Oh, hold on ...46 min: Iceland get the second half started. Nigeria have made a change. Brian Idowu has been replaced by attacking right-back Tyronne Ebuehi. Nigeria begin the first half at a tremendous lick, with Oghenekaro Etebo brimnging a smart save out of Halldorsson with a low drive.Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies! Apologies!

After another couple of Icelandic crosses into the Nigeria penalty area, the ref blows for the interval. It hasn’\\t been a classic by any standards, but it’s entertaining enough. Iceland began and ended the half brightly, but Nigeria were impressive in between. Both teams are looking toothless up front and with better finishing, Iceland should be a goal or two ahead.45+1 min: Brian Idowu was booked for that challenge, incidentally. And it was on Bodvarsson, not Sigurdsson. We got there in the end. 44 min: Iceland win a free-kick wide on the right for a Brian Idowu foul on – I think – Gylfi Sigurdsson. Sigurdsson curls a wonderful cross in and Alfred Finnbogason looks certain to score. He’s not able to make meaty enough contact and the ball flashes wide of the far post.43 min: Nigeria corner. Iheanacho curls it towards the far post and out of play. I wonder if the Leicester City striker’s role as corner-taker is as contentious in Nigeria as Harry Kane’s used to be in England during Euro 2016 ...40 min: Both managers will, probably be happy enough with how their teams are playing, although both seem to be lacking quality in the final third. A case in point: Bjarnason finds himself in space in the inside left channel and drills a cross into the penalty area, but fails to pick out Bodvarsson in a good position. 39 min: Wilf Ndidi picks up the ball from Victor Moses about 10 yards outside the Iceland penalty area. He curls in a cross but there’s nobody in a Nigeria shirt in range. Moses castigates his team-mate for not playing the ball back to him.38 min: Nigeria free-kick, down near the corner flag. Kelechi Iheanacho curls the ball towards the near post but it’s headed out for a throw-in. Mikel chucks the ball to the edge of the penalty area, but Musa is unable to flick it on. The ball eventually goes out for a goal kick.35 min: Saevarsson curls a wonderful diagonal cross into the Nigeria penalty and a header from Leon Balogan puts the ball out for a corner. Jon Bodvarsson and Birkir Bjarnason were lurking with intent at the far post and one of them would surely have steered the ball goalwards but for the interception of the Nigeria defender. Nothing comes of the ensuing corner.33 min: Iceland win a throw-in halfway inside the Nigeria hal, but don’t throw it long. Instead, Birkir Saevarsson takes the ball past two men and sprints to the edge of the penalty area, where he’s dispossessed.32 min: Nigeria continue to dominate possession, albeit without doing anything with it. There’s not a lot going on here at the moment. Iceland win a free-kick deep in their own half for an Ahmed Musa foul.28 min: The camera cuts to Iceland coach Heimer Hallgrimsson, who is spending most of the match hunkered down on the edge of his technical area constantly communicating with his players. He has them very well drilled – their defenders and midfielders are moving from side to side of the pitch in two lines of four that wouldn’t look out of place on a foosball table.25 min: The ball barely leaves them iddle third of the field for three minutes, but eventually ends up back in the hands of Nigeria goalkeeper Francis Uzoho."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b567400464d967eb0aea0cfa5f39fdc84433635/99_1126_922_553/master/922.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=7da805c2b76676f6c0947ecfa83e3dd8","title":"africa finally uniting now we need good politics paul kagame","story":"With a free trade agreement signed, a new era of prosperity beckons for the African continentIn Africa, our biggest threats are also opportunities. By 2035, 450 million Africans will have joined the working age population, more than the rest of the world combined in that time. They will power our economies forward, as long as there are jobs they have the knowledge to perform.I was delighted to participate, along with other government officials and the private sector, in the second African Transformation Forum this week in Accra, Ghana, where restructuring our economies for the digital age was high on the agenda. The forum took place at a time when conditions for the continent’s transformation agenda have never been better.We are experiencing greatly accelerated progress towards the economic unification of our continent. In this year alone, the African Union has adopted the free movement protocol and inaugurated a single African air transport market, which will reduce not only ticket prices but also the need for stopovers on other continents.Most importantly, in March, 44 countries signed the Continental Free Trade Area agreement. Most other member states indicated their intention to follow suit in due course.Joining up diffuse, fragmented markets would be a leap forward. Doing this across borders will require governments to work closely with each other, and with the private sector.By creating a highly networked, frictionless marketplace, we will encourage the best products, services and ideas to rise to the top. This will boost the economy as a whole and open up opportunities for women, rural populations and other marginalised groups.Ultimately, the goal is to make our economies bigger and more dynamic. No country or company will lose out in the long term. This is why business leaders are called upon to be champions of continental integration, first of all by seizing these new opportunities to grow Africa’s firms.Business leaders now participate actively and meaningfully in African Union summits. This is based on the understanding that the shared prosperity at the core of the union’s Agenda 2063 can only happen when the public and private sectors are working closely together.The business community should also contribute to holding governments accountable for putting what has been agreed into action, and pushing all of us to do more, and better.For example, given the transportation and logistical challenges on our vast continent, much more investment in joint regional infrastructure, including digital networks, is required.Globally, there is no shortage of finance, both public and private. We can attract more of it to Africa, and help close the investment gap, by planning big infrastructure regionally. This generates projects of sufficient size to interest major funds, and enhances the business case. It also makes regional integration tangible and irreversible.We also need to match external capital with African capital. African savings are not being mobilised effectively. This can help reduce risk perceptions, and also ensure we share the upside of profitable deals.Building the capacity of African firms creates badly needed jobs and skills right here on the continent and, as African construction and services firms grow, costs and operational risks will decrease.The Continental Free Trade Area goes against the prevailing trend of moving away from regional integration and the multilateral trading system. This is already making Africa stand out to global markets and investors.Finally, prosperity rests on good politics and a secure environment, because the transformation agenda requires a broad consensus that is sustained across decades. Transformation requires leadership and accountability at every level, beginning at the top, but not stopping there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5f1b0af11753de7a3adc837af96929a753fae6/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a899ed1b7d6f9a6010cd34a36ce968cb","title":"hypothetical thinking pale imitation real life","story":"When you think ahead you rely on your intellect and powers of reasoning.

This question sorts people into those for whom all that matters are the consequences (how many humans end up dead?) versus those who think it’s wrong to be the active cause of someone’s death. Most people claim to be the former, until you tweak the story so the dilemma is whether to push a fat man off a\u0026nbspbridge to stop the train and save the five workers. Suddenly, barely anyone is willing to say they’d make the active choice, though the death toll remains identical.A third group of people just finds thought experiments annoyingly unrealistic: in reality, that train would still be stuck in a station 20 miles back, “waiting for a crew member”. A\u0026nbspnew study from Ghent University in Belgium is for them. How do people respond to such dilemmas, the researchers wondered, in real life? Due to the rampant spread of health-and-safety culture, they couldn’t use real trains and actually kill people. Instead, they used mice. All participants answered a raft of moral hypotheticals, but some then faced a real-world choice: would they stand by while a\u0026nbspcountdown clock ticked down, whereupon five mice would receive a painful but non-lethal electric shock? Or would they press a button, erting the shock to a cage containing a single mouse? (The setup wasn’t really real, to be clear: no mice were shocked.) People turned out to be much less likely to choose the passive option when it was no longer hypothetical. When real suffering is involved –\u0026nbspeven mouse suffering – more of us are willing to do what it takes to minimise harmful consequences, whatever our abstract principles.There’s a lesson here, I think, that goes beyond improbable train-related emergencies to any contexts in which we’re trying to predict how we’d respond to events: moral dilemmas, but also how we’d cope with a breakup or bereavement, whether we’d flourish or founder if we switched careers, whether we’d be happier moving to another city, and so on. Thinking ahead to any such situation – as when contemplating the Trolley Problem – you’re obliged to rely on your intellect and powers of reasoning. You try to think of all relevant variables, and figure out how they’d interact.Yet when you get there, as when those experimental subjects saw the mice, it’s another matter. You respond not just intellectually but emotionally and bodily your automatic, intuitive brain (“system one”, in Daniel Kahneman’s terminology) kicks in and even on the intellectual\u0026nbsplevel, there may be numerous variables\u0026nbspyou’d failed to think of.Hypothetical thinking, in short, can only ever be a\u0026nbsppale imitation of real life. On balance, that’s good news: a reason to worry less about the future, and trust that, if the situation you’re fretting about occurs, you might surprise yourself by knowing precisely what to do.Would You Kill The Fat Man?, by David Edmonds, is the definitive account of “trolleyology”, and an unnerving way to discover that your moral principles are a lot more fluid than you thought.Read this: In her 2017 book We Need To Talk, the American journalist Celeste Headlee investigates why we’re so remarkably bad at listening to other viewpoints, and offers strikingly useful tips for better conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ebe29c4111d78ac3f0afd7eb22c373c388c569/307_464_7882_4729/master/7882.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2308a9babc7196c9d53c96b625c4fce","title":"thomasina miers recipe for raspberry cardamom and almond cake","story":"A sticky, fruity treat is just the pudding for a summertime picnicHot sun, sweet berries.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f47444656a84109e1640db0a28b46c8170d0e6b/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c4377d723f16e90053a35668fa332a7","title":"the age of patriarchy how an unfashionable idea became a rallying cry for feminism today","story":"A term that was derided and abandoned a decade ago has come roaring back to life. On 7 January this year, the alt-right insurgent Steve Bannon turned on his TV in Washington DC to watch the Golden Globes. The mood of the event was sombre. It was the immediate aftermath of multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he has denied. The women, whose outfits would normally have been elaborate and the subject of frantic scrutiny, wore plain and sober black. In the course of a passionate speech, Oprah Winfrey told the audience that “brutally powerful men” had “broken” something in the culture. These men had caused women to suffer: not only actors, but domestic workers, factory workers, agricultural workers, athletes, soldiers and academics. The fight against this broken culture, she said, transcended “geography, race, religion, politics and workplace”.Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, was one of 20 million Americans watching. In his view, the scene before him augured the beginning of a revolution “even more powerful than populism”, according to his biographer Joshua Green. “It’s deeper. It’s primal. It’s elemental. The long black dresses and all that – this is the Puritans. It’s anti-patriarchy,” Bannon declared. “If you rolled out a guillotine, they’d chop off every set of balls in the room … Women are gonna take charge of society. And they couldn’t juxtapose a better villain than Trump. He is the patriarch.” He concluded: “The anti-patriarchy movement is going to undo 10,000 years of recorded history.”Until very recently, “patriarchy” was not something rightwing men were even supposed to believe in, let alone dilate upon with such apocalyptic relish. It was the sort of word that, if uttered without irony, marked out the speaker as a very particular type of person – an iron-spined feminist of the old school, or the kind of ossified leftist who complained bitterly about the evils of capitalism. Even feminist theorists had left it behind.Nevertheless, “patriarchy” has, in the past year or so, bloomed in common parlance and popular culture. Once you tune into it, you cannot escape it: it is emblazoned on banners and T-shirts it is an unexpected recent addition to the vocabulary of the red-carpet interview it is there in newspaper headlines, explaining everything from the Irish abortion vote to the recent murder of 10 people in Toronto in a van attack, allegedly by a violently misogynistic “incel” – a man who believes he has been denied a right to sex with women. Outside the anglophone world, the Spanish patriarcado has been getting a workout so too the German Patriarchat, the Italian patriarcato and the French patriarcat. As the #MeToo campaign has grown, so has the use of “patriarchy”. It has burst its way out of the attic of half-discarded concepts to greet a moment – one of fourth-wave feminist ferment – in which there is a newly urgent need to name what women are still struggling against. The resurgence of the term is all the more surprising when one considers the forces ranged against it. Many people would question the existence of something called “patriarchy” to begin with – pointing to the strides made in gender equality over the past century, and insisting that instances of sexism are inidual and isolated, destined to fade further over time, rather than evidence of a persistent structure of inequality. There are others, meanwhile, who regard the term’s very reappearance as another sign that #MeToo has “gone too far” – and see “patriarchy” as the hysterical war cry of McCarthyite feminists determined to hunt down men who are guilty of nothing more than past behaviours once considered perfectly acceptable.For some sceptical liberals, there is a resistance to the ideological implications of grand concepts such as “patriarchy” (or “neoliberalism”), which are seen as oversimplifications of a more complex reality. Among gender studies academics, it is no longer in wide use. Once a term debated in endless articles, conferences and books, many theorists now regard it is as too blunt and monolithic to capture the nuances of oppression. Paradoxically, some on the right have enthusiastically taken up the term – regarding it not as an evil to be stamped out, but as a “natural” difference between the genders, ordained by God or biology, to be protected against rampaging feminism.But for those who have lost a basic trust in the forward motion of human progress – or who were born too recently to have known it – “patriarchy” seems exactly the word to explain the continued existence of pervasive, seemingly ineradicable inequality. The moment of #MeToo brought this into relief: it revealed to many feminists that despite all those years of working hard, of leaning in, of waiting till unfairness gradually ebbed away, of absorbing and internalising sexism, of building starry careers or else toiling away in menial jobs in the hope that their children would have it better, you could still be pinned to a bed or cornered at a party or groped, or leered at or catcalled by a man – simply because of your woman’s body.In this moment, the concept of “patriarchy” has offered itself as the invisible mechanism that connects a host of seemingly isolated and disparate events, intertwining the experience of women of vastly different backgrounds, race and culture, and ranging in force from the trivial and personal to the serious and geopolitical. For it allows us to ask, according to the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, “whether there is something in common between the Weinstein affair, the election of Trump, the plight of women garment workers in Asia and women farm workers in North America, and the Indian rape epidemic. It allows people to ask whether some machine is at work that connects all the experiences they’re having with all the experiences others are having.” The return of “patriarchy” raises the question: does the naming and understanding of this invisible mechanism offer the key to its destruction?For much of human history, the persistence of male domination was so much part of the oxygen of life that patriarchy was not even identified as a concept – unlike democracy, autocracy or oligarchy, whose relative merits were vigorously debated by the Greeks. The notion that male supremacy was “natural” was self-fulfilling, since those who wrote the laws, the poems, the religious books, the philosophy, the history, the medical treatises and the scientific texts were, very largely, men writing for the benefit of men. As Jane Austen’s character Anne Elliot says: “Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands.” You might even say that patriarchy’s particular power is its capacity to make itself as invisible as possible it tries very hard not to draw attention to the means of its endurance.But if you look at the world with patriarchy in view, you might see how some intelligent, successful and apparently assertive women fail to leave men who humiliate them and monitor their every move (such are the hallmarks of “coercive control”, now a criminal offence). You might see why even apparently liberal organisations, even those run by women, still have a gender pay gap. Or why about 80 women a year, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are murdered by a male partner or ex-partner. Why women do more childcare and housework than men, and why this domestic “second shift” has until recently been completely ignored by economists. Why the clothing of Angela Merkel and Theresa May is avidly critiqued, but that of Emmanuel Macron is not. Why there are so few meaningful female characters in films. Some concepts are like a pair of spectacles that allow otherwise invisible or inexplicable things to be seen with sudden sharpness: “patriarchy” is one of them.The word literally means “rule of the father”, from the ancient Greek. There are many different ideas about its extent and force. Some people have used it to describe patterns derived from the structure of the family to others, it is an entire system of oppression built on misogyny and the exploitation and brutalisation of women. It is not simple, in fact, to produce a concise definition of patriarchy. But at its simplest, it conveys the existence of a societal structure of male supremacy that operates at the expense of women – rather in the way that “white supremacy” conveys the existence of a societal structure that operates at the expense of black people.Part of the idea of “patriarchy” is that this oppression of women is multilayered. It operates through inequalities at the level of the law and the state, but also through the home and the workplace. It is upheld by powerful cultural norms and supported by tradition, education and religion. It reproduces itself endlessly through these norms and structures, which are themselves patriarchal in nature and thus it has a way of seeming natural or inevitable, or else, in a liberal context, it is obscured by piecemeal advances in gender equality. Because it offers the idea of a structure of power relations, rather than a series of specific sexist acts, “patriarchy” accommodates the idea that not all men enthusiastically uphold it or benefit equally from it and that some women may, on the other hand, do a great deal towards supporting it. It also allows for the fact that however much we might loathe it, we all, perforce, participate in it.Once you see the world through the lenses of “patriarchy”, the thought naturally arises: what would the world be like if it weren’t there? Some feminists have argued that if women gain equal rights in society, patriarchy will be at least sufficiently tempered. Others have argued that even if equality were achieved, patriarchy would still exist, because human institutions – political, legal, educational, cultural – are themselves, in their bones, patriarchal structures. But it says something about the nature of this inquiry that it has most vividly been answered by writers of speculative fiction. In the 19th-century novel Herland, Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a women-only society: one of calm justice, efficient agriculture and comfortable clothing with lots of pockets. In Naomi Alderman’s novel The Power, published last year, women, through a kink of evolution, gain superior physical strength over men. A bloody revolution ensues, and there is no hint that the resulting reversal of patriarchy – matriarchy – will be any less oppressive than what it has replaced. It seems to be a zero-sum game.“Patriarchy” is not a stable concept. It has fallen in and out of fashion, flourishing at moments of feminist renewal. Nevertheless, feminism began without it. Mary Wollstonecraft was clear, in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) that there was such as thing as “the tyranny of men”, but it was another 60 years before the term “patriarchy” was adopted as something like a theory of social relations.By the mid-19th century, the world was coming to seem older, bigger and more unstable than it had done before. In 1859, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published. Marx’s Das Kapital would follow in 1867. At the same time, work by anthropologists and ancient historians was revealing that there were, and had been, family structures, legal systems and whole societies that looked radically different from those in modern Paris, Berlin or London. Industrialisation and urbanisation were underway in Europe, especially in Britain women were rapidly entering the workforce. Two years after On the Origin of Species, and six years before Das Kapital, a Swiss jurist and classicist called Johann Jakob Bachofen published a book whose influence remains nearly as pervasive – even though hardly anyone has heard of it now, its substantive claims have been repudiated, and it has never been fully translated into English from its original German. It was taken up strongly by Friedrich Engels it deeply interested Sigmund Freud and its theories were absorbed by early archaeologists and prehistorians. The book was called Das Mutterrecht (“Mother Right”), and its grand theory was that, in a distant prehistoric era, the father’s role in begetting children had not been yet recognised, and women (and mother goddesses) held power in the world.For Bachofen, matriarchy and patriarchy were opposites: dark versus light, “the bloody law of the earth” set against “the pure celestial power of the sun”. His vision of the elementally opposed “female” and “male” has been hugely influential. The idea of an earthbound, essentially non-rational femininity has sometimes been claimed by feminists in a very different way, you can hear the echoes of the rhetoric, roughly filtered through Nietzsche and Jung, in the statements of rightwing male supremacists of today, especially those who speak of the “chaos” of the feminine. Bachofen himself was no feminist. The idea of the Amazons – mythical female warriors – particularly disturbed him. They represented “an extreme and decadent form of gynecocracy … man-hating, man-killing, bellicose virgins”, he wrote.When the term “patriarchy” started to circulate in this new formulation, it opened up new avenues of thought on the left. Engels, in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, drew deeply on Bachofen in order to argue that patriarchy was a crucial factor in the emergence of capitalism. For him, the arrival of patriarchy – which was associated with the recognition of fatherhood, the development of monogamous marriage and inheritable private property – represented “the world-historical defeat of the female sex. The man took command in the home also the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children”.It took a female thinker, and a feminist, to pull “patriarchy” out of the realm of theory and into the zone of experience. Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas (1938) set “patriarchy” to work on the reality of her own circumstances. For her, it described the dynamics within families like hers – in which the father held economic power and authority, boys were trained for public life and girls were debarred from either a serious education or the opportunity to earn a living. The battle lines were drawn “between the victims of the patriarchal system and the patriarchs”. In other words, it was “the daughters against the fathers”.Woolf did not here write of “patriarchy” as a social structure that went beyond the boundaries of the bourgeois household. Nor did she have time for feminine essentialism: she predicted that the opportunity for women to amass capital and property on equal terms as men would mean that women could change “from being the victims of the patriarchal system … to being the champions of the capitalist system”. She expanded: “Behind us lies the patriarchal system: the private house, with its nullity, its immorality, its hypocrisy, its servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its greed.” It is an ambiguous picture: she shows little admiration for the capitalist world she describes. And yet in her formulation – an idea that some later feminists would find themselves echoing – the “creative destruction” of capitalism had the capacity to leave patriarchy behind.In the late 1960s and early 70s, amid the ferment of revolutionary thought on the campuses of western Europe and north America, a new generation of feminist activists emerged. It was clear to them that oppression continued to bear down on women despite their increased access to the rights that Woolf’s generation fought for – access to education, the vote and the workplace. It was also obvious that existing theories of power were not equipped to explain this oppression: women had been of little interest as subjects for economics, history and sociology, with questions of gender inequality either ignored entirely or regarded as a natural byproduct of societal development. For the feminists of the second wave, part of the work was to bring women into the light. Oppression could be eradicated only if it could be identified, understood and effectively treated, quite possibly with radical or revolutionary medicine.“Patriarchy” at first provided the most useful focus for this work. Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics (1970) was an early text that attempted to flesh out “patriarchy” into society’s “most fundamental concept of power”. For her, patriarchy was everywhere it was “the most pervasive ideology of our culture”. Even ordinary, apparently harmless social norms were in fact tools of oppression, according to her analysis: romantic love, for example, was simply a means of emotionally manipulating the female by the male, tricking her into subservience. Female compliance was also ensured by force – by rape. Women were socialised into pleasing, flattering, entertaining and gratifying men. Millett called the assumed birthright of male dominance “a most ingenious form of ‘interior colonisation’,” which was “sturdier than any form of segregation, and more rigorous than class stratification, more uniform, and certainly more enduring”.The feminist Rosalind Coward, author of Patriarchal Precedents: Sexuality and Social Relations (1983), one of the weightier academic tomes on the subject, recalls going to “endless conferences and meetings” in the 1970s and 80s where the idea of the patriarchy was discussed, analysed and thoroughly broken down. Her own book sets out some of the most pressing questions, not least the conundrum of where it actually came from. “Patriarchy offers itself as an account of the history of sexual relations, but at a certain point the same question has to be asked: why was it men who took control and what were the interests thus served? These questions lead back with an unerring certainty to the same isions: are there natural sexual differences in which the sexes have distinct interests? Or are sexual dispositions produced by the patriarchal structure itself?” She had hit on a problem of circular thinking in relation to patriarchy – if it had emerged from some kind of a pre-patriarchal society, then surely the patriarchy would have been required in order to produce it in the first place.“Patriarchy” sprouted dozens of reformulations and refinements as feminists attempted to theorise it into a coherent system of domination. The radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon took a hardline view: she saw patriarchy as inscribed into the very structures of the liberal state. “Men against women” was precisely the fuel that kept society, as it is currently constituted, running. By contrast, the African American feminist bell hooks resisted the notion that the primary conflict in society was one of “men against women”, which seemed inherent in radical definitions of “patriarchy”. For her, it could be simply defined as “institutionalised sexism”. In order to end it, everyone, male and female alike, must “let go of sexist thoughts and action”.Lived reality threw up problems with the concept. Experience tells us that some men are oppressed more than some women. Not all women are oppressed in the same way. Writers such as hooks pointed out that for African American women, the family was not necessarily the site of oppression it was for white people, representing a place of possible refuge from the traumas of white supremacy. The kind of workplaces available to many black women, too, were not of the liberating kind accessible to educated white women.Queer theorist Judith Butler critiqued MacKinnon’s universalising view of patriarchy on similar grounds, arguing that it involved “erasures” of other forms of subtle and layered oppression it was a kind of “theoretical imperialism”. Butler also sought to question the “naturalness” of gender. There were many possible categories of gendered and sexual practice, she argued, not simply the binary definitions that dominated the culture. And for psychoanalytically inclined feminist thinkers such as Jacqueline Rose, “the notion that all men are a category in opposition to all women breaks down because not all men are men,” she told me. “That is, not all men embody the kind of masculinity that men are supposed to inhabit.”The eventual rejection by many feminists of the usefulness of “patriarchy” as a fine-grained analytic concept coincided with a general diminuendo in feminist debate in the 1990s and early 2000s – a period later identified by the feminist Beatrix Campbell as a time of “neoliberal neopatriarchy”. Rapid globalisation and a culture of hyperinidualism, Campbell argued in The End of Equality (2013), had in fact led to yet more extreme forms of oppression, citing brutal conditions for labouring women in Mexico, the disproportionate number of female foetuses aborted in India and everywhere a working week “institutionalised in the interests of men unencumbered by duties of care”. While feminism had not died, during this period, it had certainly withered, she wrote.A few years earlier, in her book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008), Angela McRobbie had questioned her own initial enthusiasm for the symbols of the “third-wave feminism” of that period: Sex and the City “girl power” pole-dancing classes. In those days, to throw around the word “patriarchy” – when many people assumed that moral and economic progress were destined to eradicate inequality – would have seemed eccentric, misguided or plain mad. Women, or so it seemed, had never had it so good.Patriarchy is nimble and lithe. Its margins of operation always seem to be expanding. Feminists have naturally tended to arrange their battle lines in front of the aspect of oppression that they have regarded as the most pressing. If “patriarchy” has returned as an idea in public debate, it is because feminism has returned with renewed vigour because inequality has not been eradicated.In 1990, the feminist Sylvia Walby crisply laid out six areas of patriarchal oppression in her book Theorizing Patriarchy they still seem to be ticking along nicely. In the home, women still do most of the domestic labour. In the workplace, a legal right to equal pay has not resulted in the eradication of the gender pay gap. At the level of the state, women are underrepresented nearly everywhere in the world in parliaments, legislatures, the military and other bodies. In terms of male violence, the charity Rape Crisis estimates that in Britain, 11 rapes are carried out or attempted every hour of every day. Women and men are still judged differently when it comes to sex. And the “patriarchal gaze” is still strong in education, religion, culture and the media. And so, for feminists right now, the uses of “patriarchy” are greater than its analytic flaws it allows feminists to perceive the gap between the status quo and what they would like to achieve. “If patriarchy weren’t effective, we wouldn’t need feminism if it were totally effective, we wouldn’t have feminism,” Jacqueline Rose told me.Feminists of an older generation note that the popular revival of “patriarchy” has not (yet) been accompanied by the intense debate and academic theorising that flowered around it the 1970s. It is a slogan and a popular rallying cry rather than an analytic tool. “What I don’t like about it,” said Mary Beard, “is that it is convenient and simple. I don’t really like ‘misogyny’ either, for the same reason. It’s no more a tangible ‘thing’ than capitalism. Saying ‘crush the patriarchy’ has a nice ring, but it doesn’t contain any political analysis.”While it is true that lots of intangible things are pressed into service as useful abstractions for helping us understand the world, some feminists still worry that “patriarchy” is in danger of being oversimplified in the course of being co-opted into public debate. “It is now seemingly used almost interchangeably with sexism,” Rosalind Coward said, “and it certainly doesn’t seem to be accompanied by a discussion about where it came from.” Jacqueline Rose told me: “It’s used as a call-out phrase, as if it explained everything. It’s fine to use it as a tool, as long as you don’t mistake it for a complete description of how the world is organised.”But then, perhaps the revival of “patriarchy” is a bellwether for today’s feminism, which is presently more concerned with action than theory. The concept has survived its biggest theoretical challenge – that of intersectionality, which argues that “patriarchy” universalises and oversimplifies the subtle realities of oppression – because it offers a description of the world that many people recognise, and that unites the many people who want to fight against it. It is particularly suited to today’s fast-moving, hyper-connected digital feminism, where immediate, personal connections can be made in an instant between feminists across the world and radicalising work done in a moment.“Patriarchy” is also deeply energising to those who use it. There is a certain relief in giving a name to the affliction. It has a satisfying ring of old-fashioned radicalism about it, and it comes with a sharp flavouring of conflict. “Patriarchy” is a battle cry. That is not surprising: the internet has enabled the rapid expansion of feminist campaigning, but also the deep and sometimes violent radicalisation of those who fear and hate it. A reaction against the new feminism has arrived almost simultaneously, as the discontents of disgruntled and unsettled men are stirred and stoked online, in the so-called manosphere. Cynical politicians crusading against “political correctness”, such as Trump, have fed off this baleful energy. In this clamorous world, “patriarchy” has become “the patriarchy”, a further simplification that makes it seem even more crude and concrete – less of an invisible mechanism, more of a statue to be smashed.One might reasonably ask whether the patriarchy is truly in any danger, as Steve Bannon fears. It is easier to topple patriarchs, as Susan Faludi pointed out in the wake of Weinstein, than patriarchy. Powerful men who have been called out by #MeToo have left the room, but the room itself still looks very much the same. (Some of the men, too, look very much as if they will be returning to the room quite soon.) If anything can unravel “the rule of the father”, it is likely to be the gradual shift in the way gender and sexuality are being understood. New ways of bringing up children outside traditional family structures will chip away at it. So will the rising generation of bold young feminists who have not internalised oppression like their elders, and who are calling out sexism and misogyny where they see it.But Bannon can relax. As Mary Beard said recently: “Patriarchy has had several thousand years of practice – of course it’s good at it. It’s very good at bolstering its own sexist values.” If a horde of angry leading women did take a guillotine to the testicles of Harvey Weinstein, patriarchy would survive. The word “patriarchy” ought to be a reminder that Weinstein and his ilk are the symptom, not the disease – but it is easier to tackle iniduals than structures, signs rather than causes.At the moment – although the picture varies wildly across the globe – feminists are increasingly using the tool of “patriarchy” to recognise the subtle depth of the forces that keep oppression in place, from the expectations about the behaviour of women in the workplace to the way they are portrayed in fiction. It will be harder to unravel the effect of this cultural inheritance than it was to get the vote. As Max Weber observed, it is the very longevity of patriarchal traditions and norms that serve to prop it up – “the belief in the inviolability of that which has existed from time out of mind”. The eradication of patriarchy looks like a task of enormous complexity when it is smashed, it will take a lot down with it. And so the patriarchs – from the bully in the White House to the bully in your workplace – are still in charge.

At the same time, a few hundred metres away, the prime minister took to a makeshift stage in College Gardens to revive her vision of post-Brexit Britain.Theresa May framed her remarks in terms of the crisis shaking the established order of liberal democracy across Europe and the US. If May has one core belief, it is that to fail to deliver on the EU referendum would fan the flames of populism.“Nothing would hurt our democracy more than to give the people the choice, and then not to trust their judgement when they give it,” she told guests at the Policy Exchange thinktank’s summer reception. Plenty of Conservatives would dismiss her sentiment as simplistic. However this appeal to the will of the people has become a monstrous cudgel against more nuanced response. The paradoxical consequence is that, having weaponised this “will”, it is now threatening the political cohesion upon which liberal parliamentary democracy, and the Tory party itself, depends.Leaving the EU is disproportionately a crisis for the Tories. With the second anniversary of the referendum falling on Saturday, the dilemmas remain over how to leave and what the consequences will be. But one other question has arisen: is a post-Brexit Conservative party an oxymoron?This month’s Prospect magazine asks if the Tories can survive Brexit (spoiler alert: no). Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, writes in this week’s New Statesman (£): “We will not know the final nature of Brexit for many months, or even years, but what we do know is what it is doing to our politics.” He warns that his former boss is doomed, like a character in a tragedy, to see the need for change yet be unable to deliver it. “Destiny dictated that she would be the prime minister who delivers Brexit … and few domestic reforms.”As Timothy acknowledges, however, it is not just Brexit. It is what is left of the Conservatives.The party in the country – a shrinking band of fewer than 100,000, disproportionately old, white males in favour of Brexit – retains its oppressive control over the party’s future as the electors of any future leader. It is easy to see it as the embodiment of the party’s rediscovered appeal to older, poorer, whiter parts of the UK. Sitting amid the wreckage of Cameron’s failed experiments in modernisation – the NHS reforms that May has pledged to reverse, the arbitrary cruelties of universal credit, the unaccountable education reforms, and the referendum itself – the party is searching for a more appealing reason to exist.One response is a perceptible leaning towards a pre-lapsarian Toryism, the era before Margaret Thatcher.Neil Carmichael, the chair of the cross-party education committee until he lost his seat in 2017, regards Mayism almost as a reversion to the era of Ted Heath and the 1970s.“You listen to the talk of an industrial strategy and the power of the state to intervene, and it is almost as if the Thatcher years never existed,” he says.It has become a commonplace – as an example of how new thinking is possible even in the darkest hours – to reference the 1942 Beveridge report. Unlike Beveridge, however, the new or reinvigorated thinktanks and the increase in intellectual headscratching on the fringes of Westminster is not so much at the frontier of new thinking: it is an attempt to find pragmatic solutions to the overwhelming sense that capitalism has failed. In September, the second Big Tent ideas festival is to be held in Cambridge. Partly an attempt to capture the attention of the next generation, it is morphing into something bigger. Its prime mover, the former minister George Freeman, fears the government has failed to comprehend the scale of the challenge ahead. “As the last election showed, simply implementing Brexit without a bold programme of one nation reforms will fail.”  Lined up against Freeman and his small band of radicals is Michael Gove, the environment secretary and self-appointed analyst of disaster. Along with Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, he is the chief hope of reformers seeking more incremental change. Earlier this month, Gove made a speech about the economy that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, might have applauded.“Economic power has been concentrated in the hands of a few … crony capitalists have rigged the system in their favour … debt has fuelled growth in an unsustainable fashion… Our politics, culture and regulatory models have worked against innovation ... Many of our fellow citizens have seen less and less value placed on their work and themselves … communities and iniduals have seen so much of what they value which is beyond economics … overlooked or ignored.”As May noted wryly on Wednesday, Gove has become ubiquitous on the thinktank circuit. With Davidson, he is backing the newest one, called Onward. Its name is not a deliberate echo of Emanuel Macron’s En Marche party, just as Gove would deny being a Macronesque-style disrupter. Yet Onward boasts that it is about more than ideas. The spokesman, Nick Faith, says: “Onward is all about outcomes, about what works.” On Monday it publishes its first report, on housing. It is an attempt to combine a “big bang” idea – on the buy-to-let market – with pragmatic interventions. “If you come in with the viewpoint that either the market or the state is best at delivering something, you’re starting from the wrong position. The position should be, what is the best approach to get the best outcome for the inidual. Your ideology can’t cloud what works best in practice.”But there are many Tories for whom the libertarian Ayn Rand is still queen and the market still sacred. These are the people who fear a soft Brexit would really mean Brexit in name only. On Wednesday, one cabinet Brexiter celebrated the passage of the withdrawal bill with a toast to a change in the political weather. But no political meteorologist can forecast what that change might mean, nor if the Tory party has the capacity to respond.

Danny Cipriani has just been handed his first England start for a decade against South Africa and the man he calls his “Super Dad” is beaming. “Danny has just stuck in there,” Black says. “He hasn’t become a broken man, he’s kept playing at the best of his ability and eventually he’s become irresistible.”Black, who worked with Jonny Wilkinson for nearly 20 years, has been fulfilling the same mentoring role with Cipriani since 2013. A former nightclub bouncer, now a professor of practice at Newcastle University Business School, he speaks to the returning England fly-half on an almost daily basis. He provides Cipriani with “a better view of life”, bringing clarity to a once cluttered mind, focus where previously there were too many distractions, contentment when before there was restlessness.“All I ever say to him is that all he can control is his personal standards,” Black says. “Behaviour can be infectious and contagious so I want his to be superb. He’s a fountain of energy and it’s important people see that about him.”Cipriani makes his fifth England start on Saturday – when he produced one of the most complete fly-half performances in living memory on his debut against Ireland in 2008, aged 20, he was destined for a truckload more. At first injury struck and more front-page headlines than back gave rise to a reputation that has been hard to shake. “We’ve worked very hard at that, day by day, week by week, to say, we really know who you are, your character is there, we know what it is,” Black says. “Sometimes these things don’t come to the forefront of people’s minds enough but he won community player of the year at Wasps, he visits hospitals and schools – he’s got a good heart. Sometimes in life we’re very good at helping other people and not great at letting other people help us. Danny has discovered that. He’s a great natural helper of other people but now he’s quite happy for other people to help him.”As proud as Black is that Cipriani has won his place back in the England side, he is equally pleased at how Eddie Jones’s perception has changed. It got to the stage where Martin Johnson seemed more likely to pick himself at fly-half than Cipriani while Stuart Lancaster was largely reluctant and overlooked him for the 2015 World Cup squad despite a fine cameo against France shortly beforehand.At first Jones was equally distrusting. “I’m sure Eddie can appreciate the effect Danny has on the mentality and the creativity of the squad,” Black says. “Contrary to some people’s belief, he’s a superb team man because he realises that as the star quarterback, if he’s not a great team man it will not work. You have to be quite unselfish in that position to bring out the best in others around you.”Black extols the virtues of kaizen, a Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement and as such, he does not see wasted talent or underachievement in Cipriani, rather someone who is still to reach their peak. “He’s a better player than he’s ever been but there’s no reason he can’t be getting better and better. Remember what I used to say about Jonny, right at the start, I used to say he’ll reach his best when he was 34 to 35 and judging by how he played at Toulon I would suggest he did. Danny certainly hasn’t got to his best yet. I would expect him reaching his best, and we’ve spoken about this a lot, in maybe three or four years’ time.”Saturday represents the chance to stake a claim for a place in next year’s World Cup squad – the driving force behind Cipriani’s decision to snub lucrative offers to play abroad during his long spell in the international wilderness. “He’s patriotic, he’s very proud to represent his country,” Black says. “Even though he wasn’t given a chance in the 2015 World Cup, the dream never left him.”While effusive in his praise for Black after his recall had been confirmed, Cipriani also stated he plans to be the “calmest man in the room” at Newlands. Where once he may have tried too hard to make things happen, Black expects to see a fly-half at ease with the task in hand. “He’ll not force it too much and if he does it’ll be a calculated risk once in a while. Great players make decisions and execute them well and if he were to ever step out of structured plans now, it would be to win or save the game. He sees things lots of other people don’t see but he can now mould that to what other people can see which is very special.”It is hard to escape the sense that Cipriani is the people’s choice as England fly-half. His unmistakable talent and the Prodigal Son narrative make for an irresistible combination – no bad thing according to Black. “He’s the type of lad who doesn’t mind being loved, it helps him enormously. Some people say they don’t need encouragement but I think we all need it really.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43fff35349a39f4141bc4368e8cd4e1eba7fad8c/0_110_3837_2303/master/3837.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=581cbcab9b8bb676a992328135dccb06","title":"royal ascot 2018 day four live","story":"Beaten only by a very well handicapped rival in this race last year, Appeared is just 2lb higher and will be a big player if in the same form as the rest of Roger Varian’s older horses this year.And they’re off ...

Would be wonderful to see the winner at the Breeders’ Cup later in the year and though she was coy on that idea it would seem to be an obvious plan given the owner’s history of sending top-class horses there.Eqtidaar clung on for victory in the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot. Sir Michael Stoute’s three-year-old had failed to win in three starts since making a successful racecourse debut at Nottingham last summer, and was sent off at 12-1 for what looked another hot renewal of this six-furlong Group One.Jessica Harrington, the winning trainer of the Coronation Stakes, has been talking to ITV Racing about that exciting performance by Alpha Centauri. We didn’t get any wiser about what the plan might be as she wasn’t asked unfortunately. All racing fans will be keen to discover where this horse runs next. And they’re off ... Aim Of Artemis is running wide ... Veracious has the lead and Aim Of Artemis joins the main pack ... Veracious goes for home but Alpha Centauri challenges and goes clear ... And that was the most impressive single performance of the week ... That was a joy to watch and that filly is going to take some beating in future races.To underestimate a filly once is unfortunate but to do it twice would be reprehensible, particularly in the case of Billesdon Brook, whose Guineas success looks a very solid piece of form indeed. Those that finished in the next six places have advertised the quality of that race again and again and she can show up her doubters by landing the Coronation Stakes on day four at Royal Ascot. The Oaks runner-up and the French Oaks winner were among those she beat fair and square that day. Nor was it the first time she had shown impressive speed on fast ground. She gets her ground again and looks the right bet at 13-2, despite a nagging doubt about the form of her stable.And they’re off ... Main Desire missed the kick ... Unfortunately well outpaced ...

A son of Scat Daddy, who has proved such a strong influence for top-class speed, he won the Norfolk at Royal Ascot last year, followed up in a Group One in Ireland and promised better to come with the way he won his warm-up race for this at Naas last month. Equilateral is worth a try at this level, having won a novice contest so easily at Doncaster last month, but his stable has been short of winners lately, for all that a couple of stablemates have gone close here this week.And they’re off ... Raa Atoll leads from Rostropovich ... Old Persian has moved into second ... Frankie has slowed the pace in front seemingly ...

Main Edition maintained her unbeaten record with victory in the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot. Mark Johnston’s filly followed up her debut win at Windsor with a runaway success at Goodwood three weeks ago and she was a 7-1 shot stepped up to Group Three level in Berkshire. Johnston said: “We came here knowing that she was pretty useful after two runs and two wins. We think our team of two-year-old fillies this year is very strong and this is was one of the leading bunch. It’s great for her and it says a lot for all the others as well.”Paddy Power introduced the winner at 16-1 for next year’s 1000 Guineas, with RaceBets going 14-1. Johnston said: “I think it’s very early days to talk about that, although we were joking with the owner that we’d be back here next year for the Coronation Stakes after she’s won the Guineas! The media and the bookies will all start talking about it now, but there’s a lot of big two-year-old races before we come round to that. Let’s get this year out of the way and see where she stands.” PAIt’s 14 years since Aidan O’Brien won this race for the one and only time, which is a bit worrying because few trainers would have suitable runners for this race as often as he would. But he’s having a good week with three-year-old colts that weren’t quite up to Classic level, following the wins of Hunting Horn and Kew Gardens, so it could be worth giving another chance to Delano Roosevelt. He stayed on to be sixth in the Derby and may do better around this more conventional track. The unexposed Wells Farhh Go is an interesting alternative.There was some potentially significant news for the sport released last night when it was announced that Ascot would start publishing sectional timing at the track. It’s a topic I’ve been coming back to ALL my racing life - and I started in racing journalism in 1986. How can we start to analyse a race unless we have the means to use times? It starts with the race commentary and phrases such as “looks a good pace” etc. I don’t blame the commentators though. They have no idea because we are not seeing times as they are being run. How can those who study racing analyse fully afterwards unless we have the recorded sectionals of the race? How can racing be sold as a mature betting medium unless the sport does this? The only way we started to realise about how good Tuesday’s impressive Royal Ascot winner Calyx was was through the clock. Chris Cook wrote about the announcement in a story the  published yesterday. You can read all about it here:And they’re off ... Stillwater Cove is already four lengths clear ... Main Edition leads on the nearside ... Fairyland is finishing well ... Main Edition still leads ... and holds on from La Pelosa ... The winning filly was highly rated by her trainer Mark Johnston and could prove pretty useful. The favourite, Just Wonderful, is not bred to be ideally suited by six furlongs and is one to note when back over farther.Mark Johnston seems to have a smart juvenile in Main Edition, unbeaten in her two runs so far and an impressive winner at Goodwood three weeks ago after travelling kindly round that tricky course. She’s a half-sister to one Royal Ascot winner, Beachfire, and also to the classy Major Cadeaux, beaten less than a length in the Coventry. Wesley Ward put in a good word for his Stillwater Cove after another of his youngsters won yesterday but his two-year-old winners at Ascot have been over five furlongs and the last 200 yards here might be a stretch for the US raider.It is just under 20 minutes before the first race of the afternoon on day four at Royal Ascot and Sioux Nation, in the Commonwealth Cup, looks like being the best-backed runner of the day. Aidan O’Brien’s sprinter has emerged as the 7-2 favourite for the first Group One of the day, while Equilateral, who was vying for top spot in the market this morning, has drifted out by a point to a top price of 5-1.Another of Ryan Moore’s mounts, Delano Roosvelt in the King Edward VII Stakes, is also attracting solid support and is now top-priced at 5-2 having been available at 3-1 this morning. Raa Atoll, Frankie Dettori’s partner in the same race, is also popular and is in to 4-1 (from 5-1), while Old Persian is on the drift and out to 13-2 to give William Buick his third winner of the week.A couple of fillies at each-way prices have attracted support in the Coronation Stakes. Teppal has been nibbled at from 10-1 earlier in the day and is now top-priced at 17-2, while Mark Johnston’s Threading, briefly available at prices up to 12-1 earlier on, is now no bigger than 8-1.

I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger back in 1994 when one of his installations, called ‘Royal Ascot’, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage’s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: ‘Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen’s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen’s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol’s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his ‘Reigning Queens’ series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.’The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year’s ITV broadcast. See if you can spot the difference ...I can pass on some good news about the carriage horses who smashed their way into a clothes shop on Ascot High Street yesterday. Both will recover form their injuries and there is no danger to their lives, according to two grooms I spoke to who were working with other carriage horses here on Friday morning. The grooms did not wish to be named because they work for a rival firm to the one whose carriage was involved in the crash. However, they say that the horses involved are based this week at the same Windsor-area stable as their team and report that both have survived with nothing more serious than cuts and abrasions. The carriages are typically pulled by four horses and none of the four involved in Thursday’s crash are working on Friday only the leading pair were apparently injured, when they collided with a shop window after bolting downhill and across a roundabout. A witness described one of the horses as lying on its side on the pavement while onlookers tried to stem the flow of blood from its side. A horse ambulance arrived soon after and it appears efforts to save the horse have been successful.After three days of pointing backers in the right direction this week this could get tricky. My titfer tipster is plumping for purple but one thing is sure this has been a glum week for layers offering odds on the monarch’s Hat Stakes and apparently green is the colour of choice for backers today.“Last year was one of the best ever but after three days of the public predicting the correct colour of the Queen’s hat, this has resulted in the most expensive for this particular novelty bet on record at Royal Ascot,” said Alexander Kostin of Bonuscodebets. 2.30 Albany Stakes Main Edition 13-23.05 King Edward VII Stakes Delano Roosevelt 3-13.40 Commonwealth Cup Sioux Nation 9-24.20 Coronation Stakes Billesdon Brook 6-15.00 Queen’s Vase Poetic Charm 14-15.35 Duke of Edinburgh Handicap Appeared 11-1Some restraint has taken over here, with four tips at 13-2 or shorter and two of them from the Aidan O’Brien yard which started the week poorly but has since found its stride, much as it did at Royal Ascot last year.

We’ll be in touch by email.Please post your tips or racing-related comments below.… The principals offer the classic choice between proven class and potential, as Sioux Nation took the Norfolk Stakes here last year during a busy juvenile campaign while Equilateral arrives with only three starts in novice events to his name. The last of those was an eight-length success, which takes some doing in any company, but he still has plenty to find on paper to trouble Sioux Nation.Victory for Sioux Nation would be a big boost for Ryan Moore in his attempt to finish the meeting as the leading jockey for the eighth time in nine years, and Friday looks a lot like it needs to be “moving day” for Moore, who starts the day one win behind Frankie Dettori. Moore rides the likely favourite in the first three races and the second-favourite in the fourth, while the shortest-priced runner in Dettori’s book of rides is Raa Atoll, a 5-1 chance for the King Edward VII Stakes at 3.05.The fourth day at Royal Ascot was once something of the week’s poor relation, the place where some of the meeting’s less significant events were washed up when the event expanded to five days and there was nowhere else to put them. It has been much revived, though, by the arrival of the Group One Commonwealth Cup three years ago to support the Coronation Stakes, which just goes to show what can be achieved when you are willing to bend the rules just a little.There are roughly 10,000 horse races in Britain each year and only 36 of those have the Group One status, which puts them at the very pinnacle of the pyramid. It is supposed to be earned over a period of years, or even decades, rather than handed out on request. It does seem to help when those doing the requesting have a connection to the Queen, however. The Commonwealth Cup was a Group One from the word go and it has certainly delivered on its promise, swiftly becoming a rival for the Coronation Stakes as the feature event of the afternoon.Last year’s renewal was the best yet, as Caravaggio beat Harry Angel, a subsequent dual Group One winner and the favourite for Saturday’s Diamond Jubilee Stakes, and Blue Point, who took the King’s Stand Stakes here on Tuesday.Caravaggio was odds-on to beat 11 opponents 12 months ago, but this year’s Commonwealth Cup provides a very different challenge for the punters, with a full field of 22 runners due to go to post and two horses – Sioux Nation and Equilateral – vying for favouritism at 4-1 (the same price as the market leader for the 28-runner Wokingham Handicap tomorrow) …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ad9a106ea471255aa37125f896a34fa90a0b7b8/0_212_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=438fc4839db2e4d1f54973bb9e5e9e17","title":"united nations poverty report philip alston","story":"In damning report, UN’s poverty monitor hit back at criticisms by Nikki Haley, saying government policies would punish millions of low-income AmericansThe Trump administration has been castigated at the United Nations in Geneva for consciously exacerbating levels of inequality in America that are already the most extreme in the western world.The excoriating report on the state of the US nation was delivered to a packed hearing of the human rights council on Friday by the UN’s monitor on extreme poverty, Philip Alston. In what is now turning into a battle of words between the US government and international observers, Alston hit back at criticisms that had been leveled at him the previous day by Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN.Haley complained that it was “patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America”. She accused the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights of political bias and wasting UN money by carrying out a six-month investigation into poverty and inequality in America, saying he should have focused instead on countries like Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Addressing delegations from 46 countries gathered in the chamber of the human rights council, Alston fired back that “when one of the world’s wealthiest countries does very little about the fact that 40 million of its citizens live in poverty, it is entirely appropriate for the reasons to be scrutinized”. He said that the “massive tax cuts” promoted by Trump would “overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy” while other policies pursued by the US government would stigmatize and punish millions of low-income Americans.In his most caustic comment, Alston threw back at Haley a term that she herself had used to deride the UN human rights council as a “cesspool of political bias”. Alston said that same council that he had seen with his own eyes real cesspools ­– in Alabama, during his tour of poverty hotspots in America.“I witnessed raw sewage poured into the gardens of people who could never afford to pay $30,000 for their own septic systems.” He added poignantly: “Cesspools need to be cleaned up, and governments need to act.”Such criticism of the world’s most powerful nation was all the more striking given the absence in the room. That morning, the chair normally occupied by the US delegation to the human rights council in Geneva was removed from the chamber following the decision of the Trump administration on Tuesday to withdraw from membership.The departure of the US makes it the only country to have pulled out of the world entity since the council was founded in 2006.Haley said the decision to depart was motivated by anger over the council’s perceived anti-Israeli bias, and about the continued membership within the body of human rights abusers such as Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But there was also growing speculation over whether the timing of the withdrawal had anything to do with Alston’s deeply critical report on poverty in America.Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, asked in a tweet: “Is it just a coincidence that the US withdraws from the UN Human Rights Council two days before it examines the Trump administration’s neglect of poverty in the United States?”Had the US delegation been present in the council for the hearing, they might have been forgiven for wincing at Alston’s presentation. He accused Haley of wanting to exempt the US from precisely the kind of international accountability over human rights that the Trump administration demanded for other countries.Turning to the findings of his tour of the US, he noted that maternal mortality rates among African Americans were now almost double those in Thailand. He cited new World Health Organisation data that shows that babies born in China today will live longer healthy lives than babies born in America.While accepting that the US economy was enjoying a period of growth, Alston said: “But the question is, who is benefiting. The benefits of economic growth are going overwhelmingly to the wealthy.”Most ominously, the UN monitor warned that the persistence of extreme poverty in the US would have a knock-on on the health of its democracy. He said such enduring problems “create ideal conditions for small elites to trample on the human rights of minorities, and sometimes even of majorities”.The warning was echoed by the ACLU, which told the human rights council that under Trump the US was suffering “the erosion of political participation. People living in poverty in the United States are being systematically deprived of their right to vote.”The ACLU’s Jennifer Turner referred to the more than 6 million Americans who have been disenfranchised as a result of felony convictions. One out of four African Americans in Kentucky, for instance, have been stripped of their votes as a result of felony disenfranchisement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f10f27bda987ffdd80610ddbc7ea410f4a2e3d63/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a70e69a9ac30ed1abde341f7b2d5e49","title":"venezuela rule of law virtually absent un report","story":"Government security forces in Venezuela carry out unjustified killings without any apparent consequences, as the rule of law is “virtually absent” in the country, according to a new report by the United Nations. The UN human rights office called on the government to bring perpetrators to justice and said it was sending its report to the international criminal court (ICC), whose prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation in February. The report published on Friday cited “credible, shocking” accounts of extrajudicial killings of young men during crime-fighting operations in poor neighbourhoods conducted without arrest warrants. Security forces would tamper with the scene so that there appeared to have been an exchange of fire, it said.“The failure to hold security forces accountable for such serious human rights violations suggests that the rule of law is virtually absent in Venezuela,” said Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights. “The impunity must end.”There was no immediate response from the government of President Nicolás Maduro.Under the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.\u0026nbspThis concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts. After Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.\u0026nbspIt also means that the government can’t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.\u0026nbspMaduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.Critics say Maduro has used increasingly authoritarian tactics as the Opec nation’s economy has spiralled deeper into recession and hyperinflation, fuelling discontent and prompting hundreds of thousands to emigrate in the past year. About 125 people died in anti-government protests last year. Security forces were allegedly responsible for killing at least 46 of them, said the UN rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani.Maduro says the opposition protests were aimed at overthrowing him and accuses the United States of directing an “economic war” against Venezuela. Zeid called on the UN Human Rights Council on Monday to set up an international commission of inquiry into alleged violations in Venezuela – one of its 47 member states. “The time has come for the Council to use its voice to speak out before this tragic downward spiral becomes irreversible,” Leila Swan of Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Friday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3540376.1529682765!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers want 30 pay rise for correcting state exams","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers’ unions are seeking an increase in the rates of pay that apply for correcting exams. Photograph: Eric Luke  The Teachers’ unions have called for urgent talks with the State Examinations Commission (SEC) to address a joint pay claim and avoid it having to hire iniduals without teaching qualifications to correct State exam papers next year. The call for talks comes after it emerged that a shortage of available qualified teachers has forced to the SEC to recruit iniduals without any teaching qualifications to correct some of this year’s Junior and Leaving Cert papers.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) and the Association of Secondary Teachers’ Ireland (ASTI) have jointly lodged a claim for a 30 per cent increase on the existing SEC pay rate, which they say has remained unchanged since austerity-era cuts were introduced. “I know that sounds like a lot,” said ASTI deputy general secretary Diarmaid de Paor, “but all the cuts that were applied to the public service - and teachers were hit more than others - also applied to the SEC exam payments and the reinstatement of salary hasn’t applied (to State exam payments).” While the work of those correcting exams who are not qualified teachers will be subject to the same scrutiny as qualified teachers, concerns have been raised over the implications for the standard of correcting amid fears the integrity of the State exams is at risk. “It is hard work. It is very responsible work and I think it is very worrying that you would have people who are not teachers correcting exams,” said Mr de Paor.Teacher unions say they hope to resolve the issue in the autumn to allow the Department of Education to account for the increased cost in the 2019 Budget.“Our view is that this has to be resolved in time for next year. Now that may mean that it has to be resolved in very early autumn so that if there are budgetary implications that the money is allocated,” said the ASTI deputy secretary.“It is fair to say that it is a matter of urgency. “This has to be addressed in a serious manner in time for next year otherwise the crisis is going to get considerably worse,” he said.David Duffy, education research officer with the TUI, blamed the shortage of teachers on low SEC pay rates but also pointed to the introduction of new pay scales for new entrants in 2011.“You have a difficulty there. In terms of the wider teacher issue, part of the difficulty is the shortage of teachers generally. “We can map that back to the creation of new entrant pay scales in 2011. What we also have is a difficulty not just in recruiting new teachers but we also have a problem trying to retain our existing qualified teachers. Citing figures from the Higher Education Authority, Mr Duffy said the emigration rate for qualified post-primary teachers has increased from 4 per cent in 2008 to 18-21 per cent in 2014. “We have difficulty recruiting people into the job and when they do qualify we have a difficulty keeping them in Ireland.“This issue is about pay but it is not just an issue of SEC pay but it is also an issue of the wider new-entrant problem.”Emphasising the importance of maintaining the integrity of the State exams system, Mr Duffy said “The TUI believes that qualified teachers should be correcting exam papers and supervising State examinations. It is very important for the integrity of the system that that occurs.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoIt is worrying that you would have people who are not teachers correcting exams\u0026rsquoHeads of a Bill to regulate the termination of pregnancy is due to be published next monthGary Gleeson and Stephen Dunne were arrested after detectives intercepted their vanNews, views and opinions from Student Hub contributors and  writersTeens left Ireland in 1951 to teach in first free Texan Catholic school for African AmericansNo immediate risk of shortages as dry spell increases chance of pollution in lakes and riversAer Lingus warns of flight disruption this weekend due to air traffic controller work stoppageDeclan O\u0026rsquoCallaghan, from Ballaghderreen, charged \u0026euro1,800 to send a letter to counselFormer US presidential candidate calls Russia \u0026lsquoa danger to democracy\u0026rsquo at Trinity lectureFirst case to be resolved since Limerick woman Vicky Phelan\u0026rsquos \u0026euro2.5m High Court settlementSimon Harris signs agreement to make innovative medicines available to Irish patientsTotal of 500,000 passes available for Phoenix Park visit with 4,000 more stewards neededMan (23) accused battering dog to death at house party seeks fresh bailCouple says previous caravan was unsuitable for their sick infant daughterReview begins after calls for reform following Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding trialDrivers consider not operating northside services on Friday evenings and at weekendsDelegation visits Norway-Sweden border where vehicles can sometimes be delayed for two daysHighs of 26 and 27 degrees are forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday"},{"url":null,"title":"children heard crying and calling for parents in border facility recording","story":"Read and listen to the full story at:-  June 19, 2018Trump administration policy labelled \u0026lsquoinhumane\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoheartbreaking\u0026rsquo   June 19, 2018President blames Congress and loopholes in the law for \u0026lsquoillegal immigration crisis\u0026rsquo   June 20, 2018President tells Republicans he is \u0026lsquo1,000 per cent\u0026rsquo behind immigration reform efforts   June 20, 2018Word of Trump\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquozero tolerance\u0026rsquo border policy has sowed confusion on migrant trail "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3540136.1529669001!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"farmers face armageddon if hard border is created ifa","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIFA president Joe Healy - ‘Our position remains: no border on the island of Ireland, no border in the Irish Sea and no scope for the UK to pursue a cheap food policy.’ Photograph: Finbarr O’RourkeIrish farmers face “Armageddon” if the UK remains outside the customs union and a hard border is created on the island of Ireland, their most senior representative has said. Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) president Joe Healy was speaking following a visit by 40 farmers to the border between Norway and Sweden to examine the impact on business and trade when crossing a land border between a country inside the EU and one outside.The delegation spoke to officials and witnessed customs checks in operation ahead of next week’s EU summit to discuss Britain’s exit from the union.Mr Healy said their concerns about Brexit had been heightened as a result of the visit on Thursday. He added that it was “fantasy stuff” to believe there could be anything other than a hard border on the island of Ireland if the UK was outside the customs union. The IFA delegation, including national officers and county chairs had a joint briefing from senior customs officials from Norway and Sweden.Speaking from Norway on Friday, Mr Healy said the IFA delegation had met three senior customs officials with almost 100 years of experience between them. He said that while there was “excellent” co-operation between Norway and Sweden in relation to border checks, there could still be delays to commercial traffic. The border point the delegation visited was the “second busiest” between the two countries and it was still not open for 24 hours a day, Mr Healy said. The officials informed the farmers’ group that there could be delays to some vehicles of anywhere between two minutes and two days, he said. There were about 14,000 commercial crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic every day, he added. Mr Healy said many in the UK had cited the Scandinavian border as an example of one which caused minimum disruption to trade.But he said he was struck by “the logistical challenges for trade that arise from the border despite the fact that the arrangement has been in place for over 20 years”.“While Norway is part of the EEA and the Single Market, the fact that it is not in the customs union leads to inevitable bureaucracy and checking, which causes delays and adds to the cost of doing business,” he said. “There is no question that the border crossing poses significant difficulties for those who wish to trade between the two countries. Technological advances cannot mask the fact that having a border with a country outside the EU is extremely challenging.”There was growing concern among farmers about the lack of progress on the Brexit talks, he said.“Two years on from the decision, we need clarity on what the outcome will be. There is a general acceptance that not much progress will be made in Brussels next week, but the withdrawal agreement is due to be finalised by October,” Mr Healy said.“Our position remains: no border on the island of Ireland, no border in the Irish Sea and no scope for the UK to pursue a cheap food policy.”He said he welcomed the solidarity from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker during his visit to Dublin on Thursday, adding that the impact on Ireland, and on our largest indigenous sector which was agri-food, had to remain central to the EU negotiating position.Mr Healy said the task for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Government was to hold the EU to its position and to guarantee that Irish farmers were not exposed in the final outcome.“The UK is our best market and we do not want to see trade disrupted, either by value or volume,” he said.

So far the only Irish flight that has been confirmed as cancelled is the Dublin-Nice return flight on Sunday. The air traffic controller strike is also expected to cause “significant” delays to other flights both between and over France this weekend, due to what Ryanair decsribed as “unjustified strike action.” A spokesman for Ryanair said: “All affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options: a full refund, rebooking on to the next available flight or transferring to an alternative flight.” The airline advised passengers flying with them over the weekend to check the status of their flights on Ryanair. Aer Lingus has also placed a warning on its website to advise passengers of “flight disruptions this weekend” due to the industrial action. The airline advised passengers flying this weekend to check the status of their flight online before heading to the airport. In its statement, Ryanair called on the EU Commission to take action to “prevent more ATC strikes and staff shortages disrupting the travel plans of Europe’s consumers this summer”.On Friday morning staff shortages among French and German air traffic controllers caused delays to 42 Ryanair flights.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire The UK is “more likely than it was a few months ago” to leave the European Union without a deal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar said the deadlock over the Irish border had increased the prospect of a no-deal scenario.Speaking after a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Guernsey on Friday, he said: “I think it is more likely than it was a few months ago but I still don’t think it is likely.“Ultimately it is in the interests of Ireland and in the interests of the United Kingdom and the interests of the European Union that we have an orderly Brexit and a new relationship that works for everyone.”The Taoiseach said talks to find a resolution would “intensify” over the next couple of months. “That’s what we are going to do over the next couple of months, really try to intensify our efforts to come to a withdrawal agreement,” he said.Mr Varadkar said there could only be a withdrawal agreement if there was a backstop for the Irish border in it. He added: “To be a backstop it needs to solve the problem. It needs to deal with customs and regulatory issues and it needs not to have an expiry date because the whole point of a backstop is that it doesn’t have an expiry date. “But it is also important to recognise that it is not something we ever want to have to use.”The British-Irish Council brings together representatives of the Irish and British governments, the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey crown dependencies.Speaking before the meeting, a UK government spokesman said: “When we leave the EU the whole of the UK — including Wales and Scotland — will be leaving the customs union and single market. There is no change to that position. “Leaving the customs union means for the first time in 40 years, the UK will have the freedom to strike our own trade deals. “Our focus is on getting the best deal possible for the UK — one that allows us to take back control of our borders, laws and money.”Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said trust between Holyrood and Westminster had been “eroded” by the Brexit negotiations. She said: “Our experience in recent weeks and months around the withdrawal bill discussions have put a strain on that trust and I think inevitably have eroded it. “I am certainly very keen to see how we can rebuild it and reestablish it.” But Ms Sturgeon said “respect and consent” must be the basis of working relations.–PA"},{"url":null,"title":"queen knights garter hundreds line streets windsor

belgiums mystic lamb revealed 600 years","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThis picture shows a close-up of the restored original of the \u0026#39Adoration of the Mystic Lamb\u0026#39 altarpiece by the Van Eyck brothersThe intense and soulful true face of Belgium’s Mystic Lamb, the central figure of a world-famous 15th century Flemish altarpiece, has finally been revealed after almost six centuries.The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, one of the world’s most stolen artworks and oldest oil paintings, was created in 1432 by Jan Van Eyck and his brother Hubert, leading artists of the influential Flemish Primitives. The giant altarpiece, which features hinged panels depicting Bible scenes and daily life, is on display in St Bavo’s Cathedral in Ghent.It was revealed this week after a painstaking restoration that tourists visiting the cathedral over the last 600 years have been gazing at a completely different lamb’s face to the original, which was overpainted in the 16th century to become an “impassive rather neutral figure”.The head is very different from what we\u0027ve known since the 16th century. It depicts a lamb which is much more intense and expressive, which connects far more directly with the people, with big eyes, restoration project leader Helene Dubois said.Restorers at the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage unveiled the painting, saying overpainting meant it had not been true to the original for centuriesKoenraad Jonckheere, professor of Baroque art at Ghent University told Flanders Today that the overpainting, “subtly adapted the shapes to the taste of the time and to some extent neutralised the Van Eycks’ intense and humanised identification of the Lamb into an expressionless animal, seemingly unaffected by what was about to come.”The original, by contrast, has more personality and sports “an intense gaze and is characterised by a graphically defined snout and large, frontal eyes, drawing onlookers into the ultimate sacrifice scene”.It was not the only time that the 20 panel altarpiece, of which 40 percent was overpainted, has suffered an indignity.  A partial restoration in 1951 revealed the lamb’s original ears but techniques were not advanced enough to complete the work, leaving the lamb sporting four ears for nearly 70 years.The altarpiece has a colourful history, and was commandeered by both Napoleon and the NazisOver the years the 15 foot by 10 feet masterwork has been split into pieces, seized by Napoleon and the Nazis and stolen by thieves. In a mystery that has baffled detectives for decades, one of its 12 panels is still missing after a daring heist in 1934.10 reasons why Belgium is not as boring as you thinkA week ago, Ghent’s public prosecutor urged people not to dig up the city’s beautiful cobbled squares after the author of a new book suggested the panel may be buried underneath one of them.The full restoration of both sides of its hinged panels is due to be complete by the end of 2019, in time for the start of a year of celebrations of Jan Van Eyck.  Please review our commenting policyFriday the 13th: How cyclones, a

prayer","story":"Created with Sketch.For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame\u0026nbspLGBT+\u0026nbsppeopleClick to followThe Independent OnlineEvangelicals assumed I was broken because of my gender identityOn Sunday afternoon I was sitting in front of a cafe in downtown Washington, sipping coffee under a sliver of roof on a wet day, minding my own business, when three people who were clearly tourists walked up and gestured for me to take out my headphones. When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But its implications are huge, and therefore have never been tested fully.Despite that, scientists rely on it to explain the strange behaviour of our universe. The new study shows that they haven\u0027t been wrong to do so.For instance, scientists have known since 1929 that the universe is expanding, but in 1998 found that the expansion had sped up and was going more quickly than it did in the past. That can only make sense if the universe is filled with a mysterious substance called dark energy – but that in turn relies on GR being correct at the scale of galaxies.As such, our very understanding of the universe relies on GR being correct.To check that, a team of astronomers looked deep into space, using\u0026nbspa nearby galaxy as a gravitational lens. That allowed them to test gravity at the astronomical scale.General Relativity predicts that massive objects deform space-time, this means that when light passes near another galaxy the light\u0027s path is deflected, said\u0026nbspThomas Collett of the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth, who led the study.\u0026nbspIf two galaxies are aligned along our line of sight this can give rise to a phenomenon, called strong gravitational lensing, where we see multiple images of the background galaxy.If we know the mass of the foreground galaxy, then the amount of separation between the multiple images tells us if General Relativity is the correct theory of gravity on galactic scales.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The ancient grave also contained the skeletons of leopards, lynx,\u0026nbspbears, cranes and domestic animals.The creatures interred in the\u0026nbsptomb are thought to\u0026nbsphave belonged to Lady Xia, grandmother of the nation’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.Naming their find Junzi imperialis, the scientists said the discovery is particularly noteworthy given the total lack of gibbons in the region today.Dr Samuel Turvey, a conservation biologist at the Zoological Society of London who made the discovery, told Science magazine that accounts of gibbons in central China are confined to the history books.“It is very, very far from any gibbon populations today,” he said.Dr Turvey came across the gibbon remains, which were first unearthed in 2004, while visiting the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology in Xi’an.British mammals’ fight for survivalThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years. The results reveal winners and losers, and highlight some of the key threat’s facing the country’s wildlife such as habitat loss, invasive species and the spread of diseases.Only one of these flying mammals has been recorded in the whole country, in a railway tunnel in West SussexThough not generally considered threatened animals, black rats number have collapsed in recent years due largely to pest control measures. However their far more common cousins, the brown rats, are thriving.Though it is difficult to measure changes in squirrel numbers,  their range has shrunk considerably due largely to the spread of squirrel pox virus by invasive grey squirrelThere has been a marked decline in wildcat populations, with only around 200 left in ScotlandThe banning of persistent organic pesticides has had a positive population effect on ottersThe 2018 review estimates a population size of fallow deer almost three times the size of that estimated in the 1995 review – a positive trend that is seen in other deer species.These aquatic mammals were nearly extinct in Europe at the start of the 20th century, but their reintroduction to the UK have been largely successfulThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years.

Its discovery was documented in the journal Science.Dr Thomas Geissmann, a gibbon expert at the University of Zurich, said the skull is a “fantastic find”, and could be the first evidence of many more gibbon species that used to inhabit this part of China.“I don’t doubt for a second that it’s a new species, and probably a new genus,” he said.Historical accounts and artwork from ancient China are full of references to gibbons, and could help scientists understand what the ape looked like when it was alive.Despite the reverence the ancient Chinese gave to these primates, it is likely that human expansion into the region’s expansive forests during this period spelled the end for its gibbon inhabitants.As forests are felled and agriculture expands, the gibbons’ habitat was probably whittled away, and the onset of a cooler, drier climate in central China at this time could have added to the pressure on its apes.Similar pressures still face gibbons today. In China, two species of these primates have disappeared recently, and the surviving representatives of the group are critically endangered.Scientists have warned that around 60 per cent of all primate species globally are threatened with extinction, including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.The Hainan gibbon, which inhabits the Chinese island it takes its name from, may be the rarest mammal in the world – with only around 26 iniduals remaining. The pressures facing these apes are similar to those that seemingly faced their ancient central Chinese cousins – human activity and habitat destruction.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The article was subsequently amended on 03 April 2018.The article claimed that \u0026lsquoMontserrat\u0026rsquos dormant volcano last erupted in 1997, when the fiery mountain reared its ugly head after a two-year-longperiod of activity.\u0026rsquo This is incorrect.The eruption started in 1995 and has continued ever since that date, with five \u0026ldquopauses in the surface activity.According to the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) the volcano is currently in such a pause, which started in February 2010.Inflation, earthquakes and gas characterise these pauses. The first paragraph said that volcano-tectonic earthquakes in February had \u0026lsquosparking fears of eruption.The MVO state that nobody in the Monserrat government, or scientific community has developed a fear of an eruption because of these earthquakes.According to the MVO five earthquakes in a week is not unusual for the Monserrat volcano because the average weekly rate since February 2010 is four.One week recorded 62 such earthquakes.This type of earthquake activity, known as a \u0026ldquoswarm, is considered to be perfectly normal at this stage in the eruption.The article also said But volcanologists monitoring the volcano have noted increased volcanic stirring underneath Montserrat.We have been asked to clarify that the MVO has regularly reported on activity and that since 2010 there has been gradual inflation of the volcano and the entire island due to the influx of magma at depth.Professor Neuberg had been re-examining some of the data in a quest for an alternative explanation and concluded that there is no reason to change MVO\u0026rsquos interpretation.The rate quoted of 35 cubic feet of magma building up beneath the island every seven seconds is a new estimate, but remains the average rate since 2010.Consequently there has been no \u0026ldquoincreased volcanic stirring.Since February 2010 the advice from MVO has always been that the eruption is not over and that surface activity may restart."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/secondary/Andy-Tate-s-Nissan-Micra-1391534.jpg","title":"fishy fish car fish tank nature nissan micra","story":"Andy Tate used recycled newspapers to make papier mache filler, then lined the car with fibre glass.

Scientists claim to have just discovered the TRUTHSince the dawn of mankind, people have claimed to have been visited by ghosts, spirits and demons.Coincidentally, the majority of people will say that their paranormal experience had occurred in the dead of night.But scientists believe they have a more rational explanation for this now, and theorise that paranormal experiences are nothing to do with ghosts, but to do with one\u0026rsquos sleep patterns.Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths University, Alice Gregory, believes there are several ways in which sleep disruption can be confused with ghouls.                WATCH: Students \u0026lsquoPOSSESSED\u0026rsquo in Peruvian school                Spirit of 3,000 year old ancient Egyptian priest \u0026lsquocaught on camera\u0027One of the ways is through sleep paralysis \u0026ndash when you reach the deep sleep state, or REM state, where you become paralysed as to not act out your dreams.However, around eight percent of people retain some form of consciousness when they are in an REM state so it seems as if their dreams are transferred into real life and it could be misinterpreted as seeing people and things which are not actually there.Another possible explanation is something called exploding head syndrome where a loud bang is heard while you are drifting off, but there is no explanation for it.Prof Gregory says in an article for The Conversation: \u0026ldquoWhen we fall asleep, the reticular formation of the brainstem (a part of our brain involved in consciousness) typically starts to inhibit our ability to move, see and hear things.Sleep paralysis could be a reason for paranormal activity\u0026ldquoWhen we experience a \u0026lsquobang\u0026rsquo in our sleep this might be because of a delay in this process. Instead of the reticular formation shutting down the auditory neurons, they might fire at once.\u0026ldquoResearching my book, I spoke to Mrs Sinclair, who is 70, and lives alone.\u0026ldquoShe told me about what she had thought was a ghost living in her house, an imp throttling her during the night and other things that had left her petrified.\u0026ldquoHaving scientific explanations provided her with immense comfort and she no longer believes in paranormal explanations for the things that she experienced.Don\u0027t believe in ghosts? These pictures will be sure to change your mind.1 of 44\u0026ldquoOur hope is that scientific explanations of paranormal experiences might help others by lowering anxiety.\u0026ldquoDecreasing anxiety has also been hypothesised as a potential method by which to reduce sleep paralysis."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/978043_1.jpg","title":"brexit news german bdi industry group no deal brexit disastrous consequences","story":"Speaking ahead of an EU summit in Brussels next week, the German BDI industry group insisted agreeing to continued single market and customs unions membership was the only way to reach agreement on the Irish border issue which threatens to wreck any chance of a Brexit deal.BDI general manager Joachim Lang said: \u0026ldquoThe danger that Brussels and London find themselves empty-handed on March 29, 2019 is high.\u0026ldquoTwo years after the referendum, Britain is drifting unstoppably towards a disorderly Brexit.\u0026ldquoThe British government is still playing for time.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky.

We have also offered to meet with them.A team of more than 25 officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit have spent the past three years meticulously investigating Rikki’s murder.Assistant Chief Constable Paul Fullwood, who leads the three force Joint Protective Services, said: “It is disappointing that following our three year investigation we have not been able to identify the person or persons responsible for Rikki’s murder.“However, although at this stage we have no further active lines of enquiry we remain committed to finding his killer.  It is frustrating that despite three years of detailed investigations we are not able to tell Rikki’s family what happened on the day of his murder but we will not give up hope to do so one day.“Whether it be new evidence or advances in forensic science, we will utilise every opportunity to investigate this murder and bring an offender to justice.“We strongly believe someone out there knows the truth and remain hopeful that one day will come to light.The young boys mum, Ruth, was tried and acquitted of his murder in 1996 - she received a seven year jail sentence after pleading guilty to child neglect offences.The case was re-opened as a cold case in June 2015 by officers of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415114014.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may britain defence power","story":"It emerged that the PM has clashed with her Defence Secretary by questioning the need for the UK to continue to be a ‘Tier One’ power.The term means having a full spectrum of capabilities, from nuclear weapons and aircraft carriers to submarines and special forces.Pressed by The Sun to reassure worried generals, the PM refused to repeat the all-important Tier One term.Instead, she would only say: “The reports that you have read are not correct.“We will continue to be a leading defence nation.“The United Kingdom is a leading member of the NATO alliance.“We are the second biggest defence budget in NATO. We are the biggest defence budget in Europe.”Mrs May also insisted Britain will “continue to spend 2% of our GDP on defence” – the standing NATO cash target - while MPs have implored here to hike the MoD’s money to 3%.The Premier’s evasion rang immediate alarm bells among furious Tory MPs and only intensified fears of a bitter new round of defence cuts.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is locked in a struggle with Chancellor Philip Hammond for more money to fill a £20bn blackhole in the defence budget.Former Army-turned-Tory MP Johnny Mercer said: “If the PM thinks that we are no longer going to be a Tier One military nation, then she will have a serious disagreement with me and a number of other Conservative backbenchers.“It is unthinkable that she would want Britain’s role in the world to diminish.“I will be pressing the PM for clarification of what this would mean for an already heavily pressurised defence budget.”The Sun can also reveal that Downing Street has demanded military chiefs bury a report on the spiralling security threats to Britain in a bid to keep a lid on calls for more defence cash.Mrs May and Mr Hammond have ordered Mr Williamson not to publish findings of an MoD funding review that highlight the new danger Russia poses until at least December.That is a month after fresh money is handed out to other departments such as health in the Budget in November.Mr Stoltenberg said: “Some question the bond between Europe and the US.But we’ve had differences before.

It is hoped it will be ready in just a few months, so they can have years to prepare everyone for our EU exit.They will have to pay £65 in order to register and stay here - which is cheaper than the price of a British passport.He told a Lords committee today that minister want to make it as simple as possible and might not involve any paperwork having to be sent in to them.Mr Javid said. You have an app, you can put your passport next to your phone, and it will download your information.Then you can take a selfie - Im sure youve done that many times - you download it too, and match the information downloaded with the chip and confirm it electronically.Other details like National Insurance numbers would be taken through the app and cross referenced with existing information.But he also had to admit that there was an issue at the moment with whether it would work on iPhones, because of problems with Apples technology.However, ministers are working on the issue with Apple, and hope to get it resolved in time for the apps launch in the autumn.Mr Javid said he wanted trials to start in July with a full roll out following a few months later.And for those less tech savvy EU citizens, Mr Javid said they would be setting up shop in libraries and local council buildings to help register people in person too.Theresa May has already agreed that the millions of EU nationals living in the UK can remain for life – if they apply for settled status.Ex-Home Secretary Amber Rudd in April said the residency application system would be “as easy” as setting up an online account at luxury brand LK Bennett.Yesterday Sajid Javid said he would be looking for reasons “to grant, not refuse” a right to remain.The scheme offers more “generous” rights than first planned- and better terms to those awarded to British nationals with foreign partners.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said answers will be checked and decisions given “very quickly”. There would have to be “a very good reason” for refusal.But critics accused ministers of giving in too much to the EU.Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch think tank said: “The government seem to have conceded almost every point demanded by the EU.“Meanwhile there is very little evidence that EU member states have done anything to speak of for British residents in their countries.”A row over criminal checks threatened to block the entire withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU last year. The Home Office yesterday insisted background checks would only be carried out where they had concerns.Tory backbencher Philip Davies called for more clarity from the Home Office.

Shes a remarkable woman. Were moving forward and hopefully going to get married next year. The children are really happy.The dad-of-two heard everything as wife Nicola was tragically stabbed to death by a schizophrenic home invader as she protected their kids Stanley, six, and Isabella, three.Mr Cross, an IT specialist, was working away from home at the time and 200 miles away in Hull when, during a phone call with Nicola, he heard her desperate fight for life.He appeared on the latest series of Channel 4s SAS: Who Dares Wins, in which ex-Special Forces soldiers put recruits through a gruelling recreation of the SAS selection process.The 40-year-old had ex-Special Forces hardmen Jason Fox and Ant Middleton in tearful silence as he revealed the harrowing details of that night.Marcin Porczynski, then 27 and a schizophrenic, broke into the familys home late at night intending to kidnap their two young children while Mr Cross was working in Hull.Reliving the night of his wifes death, he said today: Nikki just called me late in the evening and said she was worried about somebody outside the house and the police had been earlier.The children were in bed at the time, Stanley was six and Isabella was three. So we were discussing options on the phone, what to do. But before she could do anything, the guy broke in through the back doors and killed her.I heard it all down the phone. Its complete shock, you dont know whats going on. I felt utterly heartless. I was on the phone to the police on the other line, trying to relay information.I didnt know what had happened to the children till I heard them crying on the phone and then I thought they were OK.Mr Cross said after the killing he and his two kids moved in with his parents but he returned to his former home occasionally so he could let out his emotions in private.He underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flash backs within the first month after Nicola died.I felt like I couldnt breathe, I was back in that moment and then I realised if Im going to be a good dad to the kids and make sure theyre confident, happy adults then I need to get help, he said.In January this year Mr Cross revealed he was doing really well and had found love again with 27-year-old Alex.Discussing his new relationship he said: She came in and sort of let everything wash over her. Its a brave decision to get involved with a family thats had something like that happen to them.Shes been perfect with the children. [In her job] she specialises in under fives but she can do things with the kids, techniques and things, that I dont know anything about.Its been amazing, quite freaky really, to have someone come in whos so perfect.Porczynski pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court in December 2016 to Nikkis manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.The court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack and had been hearing voices for up to two years before the killing.Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun or call us direct on 02077824220.We pay for videos too.

Last Friday, it emerged the 1872 landmark had been sold to tycoon Sheikh Abid Gulzar for the knockdown fairground stall price of \u0026pound50,000. This is despite the fact that as recently as 2012, the pier was saved for the community by amazing local campaigners and a \u0026pound12million lottery grant. Another local group, Friends of Hastings Pier, had a new not-for-profit plan waiting in the wings, and were on the verge of reaching \u0026pound50,000 with a crowdfunder. But the administrators preferred Mr Gulzar – who has banned dog walkers, cyclists, fishing and picnics at nearby Eastbourne Pier, and threatened to introduce an entrance fee.  And the cash-strapped, austerity-hit council were powerless to help. This is heartbreaking for Hastings, but the pier is just one of an estimated 4,000 public spaces being sold off every year in every austerity-squeezed town in the country, according to a new report. The Great British Sell Off, produced by charity Locality – who dug out figures via FOI requests – says 20,651 public assets were sold off in the last five years alone. Locality chief Tony Armstrong points out that “4,000 buildings is more than four times the number of Starbucks in the UK”. Many are being lost to private developers for the highest price and will never be used by the community again. Some, like Hornsey Town Hall in London, are being made into flats while others, like the former Grade II listed Ealing Town Hall in West London and the landmark Liverpool Municipal Buildings, will become luxury hotels. In West Yorkshire, residents are trying to save the former Dewsbury Museum, closed by the council in 2016 after 120 years.  For the last 18 months, I’ve been retracing George Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier through the industrial North and Midlands – and this great sell-off of our public spaces has been evident in every town in the country. Wigan Pier was basically a music hall joke about a coal jetty in landlocked Wigan, but across the country we’ve found evidence of the local authority fire sale. Privatised piers and boarded-up or flogged-off libraries, swimming pools, working men’s clubs, lidos, town halls, museums, youth centres have all been sold to the highest bidder. As councils have been squeezed by the Government and forced to choose between adult social care or keeping a museum open, they’ve felt forced to choose human care. But the result is all the places where we used to come together from our different walks of life have been shuttered up and closed off. The Government recently recognised we have a crisis of loneliness and yet what’s lonelier than having nowhere to go? We have a crisis of social cohesion, but nowhere we might bump into each other. Young people are being drawn into gangs by hanging out on street corners, but what about the places they used to go to?

A Tory Brexit is dangerously bad for British jobs.       One of our foremost manufacturers, Airbus, has warned that without frictionless access to our European Union markets, it cannot see a future in the UK.       From the home of Concorde in Bristol, to Portsmouth and Newport, to Stevenage and Scotland, Airbus sustains 100,000 manufacturing and related jobs.      While the impact of any Airbus exit will fall heaviest on 6000 Broughton workers in North Wales, thousands more in the supply chain hang in the balance. There is not a part of the country that won’t suffer.         Yet the fate of these workers now lie in the hands of a squabbling Tory party.       It has been two years since the Brexit vote - but we are no further forward today in understanding where this government is taking us in March 2019 than we were in June 2016.       At this rate, hemmed in by the Tories’ destructive red lines, all the signs are that we will crash out without a deal.       So when the government breezily says that it is confident that it will get a deal that will meet the need of Airbus and manufacturers like them, who are they trying to kid?      People are not fools.  Yes, there was a vote to leave the EU – and that must be respected - but it was not a vote to lose our jobs.      The chill wind of a Tory Brexit is now blowing through our communities.

The Office funnyman was called out in a parliamentary debate and accused of stigmatising the disease. MP Steve Brine criticised Gervais for an old gag where he allegedly described ME as “the one where...‘I don’t feel like going to work today’. The Minister for Primary Care said: We recognise that people with ME have encountered significant stigma, in part due to the unfavourable media representations of the condition that not only go back to the 1980s but have continued in recent times Mr Brine used the the offensive joke as an example, telling MPs : I have to say that Ricky Gervais is a very talented comic but given that he’s quite active on Twitter, maybe he could just be asked to retract that and apologise to the ME community for that comment today on Twitter.”  The minister was speaking during a three-hour parliamentary debate on the lack of funding for medical research into ME. Politicians called for controversial psychotherapy and exercise therapies recommended by the NHS after a \u0027flawed\u0027 medical trial must stop because it is making patients worse.  They called for an end to stigma and myths surrounding ME. Westminster Hall was told how people with ME are more than six times likely to commit suicide. ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) affects 250,000 people in the UK, with tens of thousands left bedbound, housebound and unable to work. Sufferers have had to face barbs of laziness and hysteria after the illness was dubbed ‘Yuppie Flu’ in the 1980s. Carol Monaghan (SNP, Glasgow North West) told the debate how ME costs the UK \u0026pound3.3bn per year. She said: “Despite the number of people affected, and the devastating affect this disease has on suffers and indeed, their families, it is very much a hidden illness. “Characterised as ‘yuppie flu’, and misunderstood by doctors and politicians alike, it receives little funding, and treatment is often damaging.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ukips dark arts king lifts","story":"NewsUKIP\u0027s dark arts king lifts the lid on 14 years with Nigel Farage - Ayes to the Left PodcastThey were branded \"fruitcakes\".

Now UKIP face being something much worse - irrelevant. Where next for Nigel Farage\u0027s flailing anti-EU party just three years after it won 4million votes - helping push the Leave campaign to victory? Mirror reporters Dan Bloom and Mikey Smith took a party legend to London\u0027s Fruit Cake Patisserie to find out. Gawain Towler spent 14 years as UKIP\u0027s tweed-clad spin doctor after cleaning toilets in a Knightsbridge club, working on the cheat phone line for video game Worms and modelling for Italian Vogue in Paris. As UKIP\u0027s official spokesman, he often found himself defending the indefensible - all in the polite chirpy manner of a Victorian gent.   So we chatted about the party\u0027s scandals, its plummeting popularity - and where it goes next. The ex-Territorial Army man confirmed the party\u0027s very existence was touch and go earlier this year as it faced bankruptcy. You’ve got those big electronic gadgets that go kthud-kthud-kthud on your chest, he said. Financially it was in huge trouble. People have resigned to help the party survive, he said - and it eventually raised \u0026pound300,000 of salvation cash in six weeks.  But he confirmed he\u0027d often been without an office as UKIP struggled for cash - working out of his living room fielding calls about racist or odd councillors. There are moments when you just sit there and go ‘what’? he said. When you get phoned by some bloke saying ‘er, the Bristol Post is going to have this story about me. You know I’m candidate? I’m also a porn star.\u0027 Some cases were eccentric - but some were wildly offensive. One activist said, in the press chief\u0027s words, “I cross the road to avoid black people. What the f***? It was truly jaw dropping. Despite staying quiet at the time, Mr Towler admitted he found it very very hard to deal with the racist rant about Meghan Markle by former leader Henry Bolton\u0027s girlfriend, Jo Marney.  And speaking of a notorious ex-MEP, he said: I love Godfrey Bloom to pieces but I did have issues with \u0027Bongo Bongo Land\u0027. Yet Mr Towler blamed a dark campaign by political enemies - including a dossier compiled by Tory central office - for exposing so many UKIP scandals. He defended gay floods man, the councillor who said floods were a punishment for David Cameron railroading through same-sex marriage. I’m merely defending his right to be odd. And he said he agreed with Nigel Farage\u0027s hugely divisive admission that he felt awkward hearing foreign languages on public transport. Umm… at times, he said. Not always, generally not, but there are moments where I find things just peculiar. Tolerance is not about agreeing with something, it’s about disagreeing with something and accepting it as part of society. I am tolerant of these things I find uncomfortable. I’m allowed to feel uncomfortable. Must we all feel comfortable because the liberal elite tell me I must feel comfortable? No. "},{"url":null,"title":"11 best spots uk watch","story":"Advertorial11 best spots in the UK to watch an amazing sunset this summerThis week marks the summer solstice – and is also the official start of summer.

June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting.  1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland   A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer.  Bike need replacing?       If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90).  And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear.  Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:   Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables   2. The Eden Project, Cornwall      Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.   Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination.   Camping out?      Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch.  Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail.   Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends.   For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.      3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales   The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm.  Why not try..       The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.         4. White Nancy, Cheshire      Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week.  Need to drive?     Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first.  A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too.    If you\u0027re making an unfamiliar journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , \u0026pound79.99 (was \u0026pound99.99, save \u0026pound20.99). With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.   5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland   There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm.  6. Hampstead Heath, London   The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.        7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight      The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.   Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier.   If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green !  The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.     8. Ness Point, Lowestoft          Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down.  Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.     9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire      With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.     10. Cotswolds, England   Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm     Find your way by car - and beat the traffic       If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).         11.

Auzair Hussain reduced his girlfriend to a shadow of herself during a campaign to control her while they were both students at Cardiff politan University. From January to March last year, 24-year-old Hussain assaulted the French national on numerous occasions and whipped her with a belt and coat hanger. He controlled a number of aspects of his girlfriend’s life including the clothes and make-up she wore, what she ate, when she could shower, and who she was allowed to speak to while he also prevented her from speaking in her mother tongue and from contacting friends and family. He also hated her laughing and made her be quiet when she was in his presence.  A sentencing hearing at Newport Crown Court on Friday heard Hussain first attacked his victim after he saw her smoking a cigarette and she declined to hold his hand in public. It was at this stage he used the belt and hanger to whip his girlfriend, including her chest and private areas. On another occasion, after she looked at a LinkedIn account of a former boyfriend, Hussain threw her about, punched and kicked her, and strangled her before trashing her room. He told his terrified victim – who feared for her life and was so scared she wet herself – he would not hit her in the head because the head is for slapping. After another argument was started by the defendant, he punched and kicked his girlfriend and forced her to strip naked.  Straight after the assault Hussain went to the gym but complained his bench pressing had been affected by hand injuries sustained during the beating. She was later forced to massage his hands to soothe his injuries. Hussain, of Birmingham, was later convicted of coercive and controlling behaviour and assault occasioning ABH and he pleaded guilty to a count of assault occasioning ABH. In a statement read out to the court by prosecutor Sarah Waters, his victim said she felt destroyed as a person as a result of the relationship in which she felt trapped. She described the defendant as being extreme in everything he did and of pushing her beyond her boundaries. She said: I think it’s difficult for anyone who has not been in a controlling relationship to understand why I stayed with him but retrospectively I hate myself for being a coward and not running away. What should have been one of the best years of my life studying abroad turned into a nightmare.

Lucia Ghahramani has strenuously denied that her husband-to-be Jack Troutt, 23, cheated on her while he was on a lads\u0027 holiday to Ibiza. The 31-year-old bride-to-be branded the woman who made the allegation, Steph Kendall, an attention seeker and has confirmed that her wedding to Jack is still on. “I don’t believe the girl. I know Jack and this girl is just attention seeking, she told The Sun. “The wedding is absolutely still on. I was angry, but more at her. Steph says she overheard Troutt bragging to mates that he slept with a woman the previous night and wrote a Facebook post about the conversation.  The post read: If this is your boyfriend Jack staying at the Azuline Bergantin hotel Ibiza him and his friends have been proudly discussing that he cheated on you last night Hun. Troutt says she simply misheard a conversation between his pals about previous relationships while sat around the pool.   The post was taken down by Steph 24 hours after it was published but had already been widely-shared on social media, including by Love Island star Kady McDermott who tweeted it to her 357,000 followers.  Jack, from Essex, has said he now fears for the future of his relationship due to the unwanted attention caused by the post.  It\u0027s devastating because I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I haven\u0027t had any sexual relations with a woman on this holiday. I haven\u0027t kissed another woman or even kissed another woman on the cheek on this holiday. It\u0027s literally bizarre.  When he confronted Steph in the hotel to explain she had misheard him, he claims she walked away from him - and the post remained being shared on Facebook .   I tried to confront her and at the same time she just kept walking away from me. I said listen, you\u0027ve got to get this post down, it\u0027s not true. She just walked away. I called her up through Facebook and she just said \u0027okay hun, bye\u0027. I\u0027ve got friends and family all contacting me asking me if I\u0027m alright because of the amount of abuse I\u0027m receiving from people all over the country. Jack is bravely speaking out and calling for tougher regulations on social media users accusing people of things that \u0027ruin their lives with no concrete evidence\u0027. I am sure I am not the first person this has happened to and I know I won\u0027t be the last. I think there should be some sort of law or regulation put in place to say how you can make an allegation like that without having anything set in stone. I just think something needs to be put in place where posts like that where you could ruin people\u0027s lives without having the concrete evidence. I\u0027ve reported this post to Facebook a thousand times but they\u0027re just not responding. They\u0027re just letting it keep getting shared and shared and shared.

He said: I\u0027m engaged to Alex. She\u0027s a remarkable woman. We\u0027re moving forward and hopefully going to get married next year. The children are really happy, he told BBC Three Counties Radio .  Nikki, 37, was brutally killed in September 2015 as she tried to protect her two children Stanley, six, and Isabella, three, from 25-year-old Marcin Porczynski who had broken into their home in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.  Dan, 40, was at work 200 miles away in Hull when he heard Nicola\u0027s screams down the phone as she pleaded for her life before she was stabbed 10 times. Porczynski later pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court to Nikki\u0027s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.   You can listen to Dan\u0027s full interview on BBC Three Counties Radio here.    Speaking about finding love with Alex, 27, while dealing with the heartache of losing Nicola, Dan revealed that he has his late wife\u0027s blessing explaining: We had that chat. We had discussed what would happen if one of us died young. Nikki said \u0027I want you to be happy. I want you to find someone else, someone that can look after the kids\u0027. I was the clown and would say \u0027If I die young, I want you to wear black for the rest of your life and never meet anyone else\u0027. We had the conversation so every day from the day Nikki died decision making was always based around what would Nikki do, what would Nikki want and we still do that today.  Nikki wanted me to be happy. She wanted the children to be happy. She was that type of person and that gives me confidence knowing I\u0027m doing the right thing. I honestly believed for a long time that I would never meet anybody else and then gradually things changed and I began to realise that I didn\u0027t want to be on my own for the rest of my life and I knew what Nikki wanted for me.

Brave Dan, who following Nicola\u0027s death set up the charity Nikki\u0027s Wishes to help children who have suffered from bereavement in his late wife\u0027s memory, says they will never forget her. Dan added: There will always be that sadness that Nikki is not around. We\u0027ll always miss her. We\u0027ll always love her. We\u0027ll always remember her. We have to keep moving forward as well as holding onto that nice bit of the past. We do, obviously, have our daily issues that we need to address around the event of what happened to Nikki and that will continue, but in general we are a positive family and we\u0027ll keep being so.     Dan first revealed he had found love again back in January when he appeared on This Morning. He said: A year ago this weekend I met Alex, she\u0027s fitted beautifully into our lives. It\u0027s a brave decision to get involved with a family like this, she\u0027s a mental health clinician and she can do things with the kids. She does memory boxes where you use your hands and other techniques to bring back memories. It\u0027s been amazing, quite freaky really to have someone come in who\u0027s so perfect.      Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, Dan explained how counselling has helped him and his children to deal with the trauma.  He said: Stanley was six and Isabella was three at the time, I was telling her to leave and go to my mum and dad\u0027s but before she could leave he broke through the back doors and killed her. I didn\u0027t know what happened to the children until I heard them crying on the phone, and knew they were okay. Dan and his children moved in with his parents after the horrific night, but he returns to his former home sometimes so he can let out his emotions in private and feel closer to Nikki.  Dan underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flashbacks within the first month after Nicola died. I felt like I couldn\u0027t breathe, I was back in that moment and then I realised if I\u0027m going to be a good dad to the kids and make sure they\u0027re confident, happy adults then I need to get help, he said.

Disgusted wife turns husband of 100 days in to police after he secretly filmed children in KFC toilets  Her schoolbag, books, uniform and school shoes were left ruined and her mobile phone was damaged, it is claimed. The boys\u0027 school is now investigating. The incident happened at around 3.30pm yesterday while the area was busy with children making their way home from school. The mother of the girl, who wishes to remain anonymous, claimed: “They pushed her in and then ran off back to the road. “She fell completely into the water with her school bag and everything. Luckily there was a ladder that was there. “She is badly shook up, she is traumatised. She is lucky, it could’ve gone terribly wrong. “The bag could’ve pulled her under the water, I feel so grateful it didn’t turn out worse. “It is disgusting. They have come from behind, she doesn’t know who they are.” "},{"url":null,"title":"scorned womens revenge same ex","story":"NewsScorned women\u0027s \u0027revenge\u0027 on same ex as they sleep with EACH OTHER and \u0027refuse to let him join in\u0027After Asa Holman found out that his exes had hooked up, he reportedly turned up at their door with a burger in a bid to get involved\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJessica Cripps14:25, 22 JUN 2018Updated14:37, 22 JUN 2018NewsRianna Brand claims she ditched Asa Holman because he flirted with one of her friends - which he denies (Image: Kennedy News and Media)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Two scorned women exacted \u0027revenge\u0027 on the same ex-boyfriend - by sleeping with each other and allegedly refusing to let him join in.  Rianna Brand, 22, said she and Sally, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, laughed after they spent the night together. The women had both previously been in relationships with Asa Holman. And although Asa was apparently the last thing on their minds as they slept together, they were pleased when they realised what they\u0027d done. I felt really smug, said Rianna. Asa had allegedly flirted and exchanged numbers with one of Rianna\u0027s friends in front of her at a party - although he denies he \u0027came on to the pal directly\u0027.  When Asa blocked Rianna on social media after they broke up, the woman got in touch with Sally to see if she had also had a bad experience dating him, Sally claimed Asa had slept with one of her friends shortly after they broke up. The insulted ladies hit it off and celebrated getting rid of Asa with a night on the town - only for things to apparently hot up. Rianna claims Asa was the ‘last thing’ on their minds as they enjoyed a passionate night together. And after Asa found out his exes had hooked up, he reportedly turned up at their door with a burger in a bid to get involved. Rianna, from Crawley, Sussex, said: “He was the last thing on our minds when it was happening. He hates to think that someone has got one over on him. “We just laughed when we realised what we’d done. It was really funny. I felt really smug. “When Asa and I were seeing each other, he told me stories about his ex. She added: “He came round to mine and decided to try it on with my friend in front of me. He gave her a lift home which p***ed me off even more.  I told him to get out. He blocked me on everything online and I thought it would be the perfect time to message his ex-girlfriend. “I waved at her online and told her what was happening. She told me he had got with her best friend. “We started talking and got on really well and she asked me if I wanted to meet up the following Wednesday for a drink.  “So I did and the following week I got a text inviting me round to hers with some of her friends. A few of us were talking about him and how much of a w * he is.  “At the end of the night we basically ended up sleeping together. “We were both fully aware of what was happening. It wasn’t a drunken mistake. “I messaged my friend and told her and she begged me to let her tell him.” When Asa found out Rianna had allegedly slept with his ex-girlfriend, he joked it off and said: “Don’t even care babe...both not my problem.” Half an hour later, he added: “Both bitter cos I never.

Sandra Miller was last pictured celebrating her 55th birthday with her older sister Lynn Bah, happily sharing cake. But a few months after that photo was taken, Sandra died in hospital. In an investigation report, Dr Martin Plummeridge from Southmead Hospital said nursing staff in the emergency hospital had found her catheter to be “caked in faeces,” Bristol Live reports. It led to a severe infection, with pus-like urine collecting in her bladder. She was diagnosed with sepsis and E.coli Septicaemia which together with pneumonia killed her.  Sandra, who had Down\u0027s Syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism and Alzheimer\u0027s disease, was in the care of a nursing home for just over a year. But she was rushed to hospital in June 2016 following complications with the catheter fitted by staff at the home. Nurses at the hospital found her catheter blocked and unattached to a bag, leaving it open to the atmosphere and infection. The open end was tucked into her incontinence pad and had become blocked. An investigation found staff had not properly drained the catheter - instead allowing a foul-smelling, pus-like urine to fill her bladder. Sandra died in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, on June 21, 2016, six days after being admitted with the severe urinary tract infection and ultimate heart failure due to sepsis. Her sister Lynn said she felt let down by the staff at Mortimer House. She said: She\u0027s had pneumonia before and she\u0027s always pulled through. She\u0027s a tough bird. It didn\u0027t even occur to me that she would die.  I didn\u0027t even find out about the catheter problems until she was buried. Finding out about that was even worse. She must have been in absolute agony. They let her down, they failed her. She should be alive and with us now. She was loving and kind, and she had a lovely laugh. We will never hear that again. An investigation found that a consultant urological surgeon had warned about the risk of Sandra\u0027s catheter becoming infected in October 2015 - eight months before her death. Milestones Trust, which ran Mortimer House Nursing Home in Kingswood, Bristol, has been ordered by Avon Coroner\u0027s Court to make changes and improvements. But 18 months on from Sandra\u0027s death, the area manager of Milestones Trust told the coroner she could not confirm whether they had attempted to discontinue the procedure that led to the death. The investigation found Sandra was discharged from hospital in May 2015 to live at Mortimer House Nursing Home.  She had problems going to the toilet due to her disabilities and was fitted with a urinary catheter at the home. It was agreed with her that she would be sedated when the catheter was being changed. But by September, Sandra started to become agitated and would try to remove the urine bag. Consequently, the home had begun to remove the bag and tubing and allow the open catheter to drain freely onto an incontinence pad which Sandra wore. However, a letter from a consultant urological surgeon in October warned nurses that this practice was dangerous, could lead to infections and should not be continued. He recommended instead the use of a flip-flow valve, an alternative to using a urinary drainage bag. Despite the letter being stamped as \u0027Received\u0027 in October 2015, the assistant home manager admitted to court the letter had not been seen by her and colleagues. Mortimer House continued to allow the urinary catheter to drain freely and eight months later, on June 15, 2016, Sandra became unwell and was rushed to Southmead Hospital. An out-of-hours doctor assessed that she might be suffering from sepsis because of pneumonia or urinary tract infection. The Prevention of Future Death report read: The staff nurse in the Emergency Department observed the catheter to not be connected to a bag nor was a spigot fitted. In evidence, the staff nurse stated the tip of the catheter was dirty. On removing the catheter, a large quantity of foul-smelling, pus-like urine drained from the bladder, suggesting the catheter had been blocked. Investigations revealed she was suffering from respiratory and a urinary tract infection and heart failure. She was treated for sepsis, and blood cultures later revealed she had an E-coli septicaemia.

Kirsty Sharman made headlines worldwide after she left the note for paramedics while they were treating her sick neighbour in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. The message read: I couldn\u0027t give a s*** if the whole street collapsed. Now move your van from outside my house. Now Staffordshire Police have worked with the council and the property owner to make sure the 26-year-old\u0027s former Tunstall home will be rented out to a different tenant. It comes as a three-month closure order - which has seen the property boarded up since March - comes to an end this week, the Stoke Sentinel reports.  Magistrates granted the closure order after Sharman subjected her neighbours to 18 months of \u0027hell\u0027. Those living nearby are now celebrating after being told Sharman cannot move back into the property. Dennis Viggars has revealed some residents even wanted to hold a street party after Sharman was kicked out. The Tunstall North Residents\u0027 Association chairman said: “When she was here you just couldn’t sit down and settle. “We got her out in the right way. We could have done it the wrong way and got in trouble ourselves but we persevered with phoning the police and in the end one person in the police thought ‘what on earth is going on here, let\u0027s sort it out’.  It took over 18 months to get rid of her but we did it in the right way. We didn’t hound her out, she hounded herself out. He alleged: “She was OK when she first moved in and we had no visions of her being a problem. But within two months it was chaos.” Dennis described the day of the closure order as a ‘great day’. He said: “We had to calm the kids down and one or two people and tell them to let the police and council get on with it. They wanted a street party when she went. “The ambulance incident started it all off again. It went viral all over the world. We had a friend in New Zealand who knew about it. It was disgraceful what she did. “I went across to have a look at the house after they kicked her out and God help the landlord when it re-opens. It would cost him thousands. It’s disgraceful. It must stink in there.”  He said the experience has brought the community together. He said: “I would like to see a good family go into that house. Hopefully we can have a say about who comes into the property because of what we’ve been through. “In the past few months life without her has been bliss. In some ways we are all better off for the experience.” Police have pledged to continue taking action to shut down problem properties. Chief Inspector John Owen said: “As the closure order comes to an end, we can confirm that the original occupant will not be returning to the address.

Hillary Harris, 31, was stunned to find the person sharing her driveway was the sibling she\u0027d never met, and the pair hit it off immediately. Describing how she felt when she realised, she said: “I began to shake. It was such an intense moment. Hillary knew her sibling was called Dawn Johnson and noticed that name on an item of post in her building. Stunned, she plucked up courage to speak to Dawn, 50, and they discovered that they had the same father, Wayne Clouse. Hillary and her biological brother Tyler Hardy, 33, were adopted in 1987 by Lee Hardy, 65, and his late wife Rochelle.  The childcare worker began the search for her biological family when she became pregnant with her daughter Stella, now seven, in 2011. Her adoption agency revealed the names of her birth parents but she was heartbroken to discover her father Wayne Clouse had died in 2002. When going through her file, Hillary discovered her late father’s obituary which mentioned his daughters Dawn Johnson and Renee Diericks, 49,  Hillary, of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, had searched for Wayne\u0027s daughters on Facebook but had been unsuccessful in tracking them down.  Then in June 2017, a woman named Dawn and her partner Kurt Casperson, 53, moved in next door. Hillary thought nothing of it at first, but in August she saw Dawn’s last name on a package being delivered.  She struck up the courage to ask her new neighbor who her father was via text and Dawn, a lab processor, confirmed her suspicions. Stunned Hillary said: “For me this is 100 per cent fate. I was so sad when I discovered my biological father had passed away. But by meeting Dawn I feel like I have all the answers I will ever need. She’s the missing puzzle piece I have been looking for for so many years. “For me something first clicked in June when I found out her name was Dawn and she was from Greenwood. My husband and I joked for a few weeks that she was my sister but we didn’t know her last name. “One day she got a delivery of shingles for her roof and it was addressed to Dawn Johnson, the same name in Wayne’s obituary. “I began to shake. It was such an intense moment.  “It was late at night, but I finally got the courage to text her and ask her who her dad was. She confirmed it was Wayne. I told her we had a lot to talk about and she said, \u0027We have the same dad don’t we?\u0027 Hillary said that since then they have grown very close. She said when she met her birth mum she thought she would have an immediate bond but she didn\u0027t. Yet with Dawn, there was a connection straight away. Dawn, who did not grow up with her father but formed a relationship with him later in life, added: “It’s such a weird coincidence. “Of all the hundreds of thousands of homes we bought a house that shares a driveway with my sister. “I was ecstatic and so was my sister Renee. She couldn’t believe it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mysterious object appears little girls","story":"NewsMysterious object appears on little girl\u0027s bedroom wall - and her mum has absolutely no idea what it isPeople have suggested lots of possibilities - some more helpful than others\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer09:20, 22 JUN 2018Updated11:36, 22 JUN 2018NewsAny idea what this is?

The little girl spotted the weird thing and told her mum, who had absolutely no idea what it is. The strange object is a black or brown colour and measures about 5cm by 3cm.  In a bid to try and work out what it is, she shared a photo on the parenting website Mumsnet .  She wrote: DH [darling husband] just gone away for three days, otherwise he would talk me down I\u0027m sure.

I honestly am so intrigued yet so horrified. Uggh. One mum added: WTF. I\u0027d be firebombing my house if I found that.  Others wanted her to poke it to see what happened. The woman replied to these suggestions saying: Briefly considered poking but I’m in charge of DC [darling child] so if I fall over in horror we are all a bit stuck. Just done 999 practice with DD just in case. Some have suggested it could be a snail or a wasps nest, but others disagree. One wrote: I think snail too. I think he has been crushed so that stuff has stuck to his shell, but has managed to crawl up the wall. It isn\u0027t a nest, they don’t stick to walls like that. He is a poor, injured snail who needs to be outside eating rhubarb. Another user replied: Definitely looks like a snail. They hibernate so it\u0027s probably been hiding in a dusty nook in your house all winter. Attic or somewhere.  But another argued: What kind of mutant f****** snails are rolling around the rest of the UK? Surely snails, look snail shaped? Others had some possibly less helpful suggestions. One said: That is NOT a snail. It\u0027s a portal to another world. I\u0027d move out!

More than 11 tonnes of the whopper sea creatures have been dragged from the sea by authorities and even sunbathers have been spotted helping to remove them. The worrying incidents have taken place in the province of Malaga, in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia across the coast from the resort. According to local media, cleaning boats have already collected 11 tonnes of jellyfish from on both the eastern and western coasts of the province.  Authorities say the jellyfish species belongs to Pelagia Noctiluca, one of the most common in the Mediterranean Sea in that area. Although this jellyfish\u0027s sting is not fatal it is said to be painful and cause inflammation. It is recommended to wash the injury with salt water and notify the lifeguards at the beach. A video shared by a man in a kayak shows him sliding over the impressive mass of jellyfish. He says: This is ridiculous.  They don\u0027t fit on top of each other. Organisation Aula del Mar confirmed that this is the largest presence of jellyfish since 2012. Another plague took place in 2015, but with nowhere near as many jellyfish. Aula del Mal coordinate a mobile phone app called Infomedusa - translated at Jellyfish information - to warn people about the presence of jellyfish near the beaches. The yellow flag has been raised on the affected beaches over the weekend, meaning bathers should take precaution.

She was last seen holding the man\u0027s hand disappearing into darkness at around 11.30pm. The man is later seen returning alone three hours later at around 2.30am. Police began a desperate hunt for the little girl after her parents realised she was missing and her body was found on a hillock 500 metre from the venue in the early hours of Thursday morning.  She had been raped then strangled. Police said a stone had been used to disfigure her face \u0027beyond recognition\u0027. A man, believed to be a member of the wedding catering team, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Dharmraj Meena, the Senior Superintendent of Police of Gwalior, said: “Our team reached the spot along with the forensic experts, after seeing the crime scene it is quite clear that the child had undergone a brutal sexual assault. The criminal had used a big stone to smash her face and kill her. We have started an investigation and the culprit will be nabbed soon, right now we have zeroed in on one person who is a part of the catering team, we are questioning him for further leads.”  The victim had been sleeping with her family at the wedding venue and had got up to get water when she vanished, according to The Free Press Journal. She went to a water point there to quench her thirst. When she did not return, her family launched a search, but failed to find her,\u0027an official said. Police said she had been lured away with the promise of ice cream. A post mortem confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted. The case is the latest in a string of horrific rapes and murders which have rocked India over the last few years. In 2012, Jyoti Singh, a young woman who dreamed of being a physiotherapist, was assaulted on a bus. Her injuries were so severe she later died, sparking mass protests, outrage and a call for change in a society where women face huge discrimination and live in fear of sexual assault. Despite the outcry, there has been little change since Jyoti\u0027s death at the age of 23.

The priceless painting is said to be signed by the renowned Renaissance artist, who lived between 1452 and 1519. Named The Archangel Gabriel, it is believed to date back to 1471, when da Vinci would have been 18. Scientific research, which has taken three years, has convinced art historians that the painting was made by the artist.  It was discovered by descendants of an aristocratic Italian family. Respected expert Professor Ernesto Solari said, CNN reports: Thankfully, they realised it was something that shone a bit brighter than the other things they found when cleaning out the house, and that is when they called us. He said that the piece gives insight into the artist as a young man. Prof Solari claimed: This piece is the earliest work of Leonardo and has his earliest known signature - it is priceless.  Handwriting expert Ivana Rosa Bonfantino said the tiny signature, painted into the figure\u0027s jawline, matches that of da Vinci.  However Professor Martin Kemp, from the University of Oxford, is less convinced. He told The  : The handling of the hair is spectacularly unconvincing - it looks like vermicelli - and the details of the costume are also wrong. Da Vinci is considered to be one of the most talented people ever to have lived. His painting Salvator Mundi is the most expensive work ever sold, after it went under the hammer for $450.3 million in New York last year.  As well as painting masterpieces including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, he was renowned for his technical ingenuity, with his blueprints including flying machines while this science was in its infancy. He left behind notebooks full of scientific drawings which continue to amaze experts into the 21st century. Da Vinci has even been credited with inventing the helicopter, the parachute and the armoured tank. French historian Hippolyte Taine wrote in 1866: There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries. He was born in Florence, Italy, and died in Amboise, France, at the age of 67.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715aae7dd-849x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc i ran and hugged bobby cox on the halfway line

28, 1962, I reckon you have to refer back to a couple of days previous.“That is when the last game of the season at Dens Park was taking place, with St Mirren visiting.“It was a Wednesday night fixture and Dundee and Rangers were neck and neck at the top of the league.“With the score at 1-0 to the hosts, St Mirren were awarded a penalty.“The 20,000 crowd were stunned and Dens Park fell silent in disbelief\u0026#8230 but massively erupted as Pat Liney pulled off a wonder save from Jim Clunie’s spot-kick.“Dundee almost immediately went down the park and Andy Penman netted the clincher for a 2-0 victory.“At the final whistle, there was the initial cheers, then silence again\u0026#8230 as the crowd waited for Rangers’ result at Pittodrie.“It was an eerie, uneasy and nervous hush for a few minutes until the over-excited announcer on the crackly sound system proclaimed\u0026#8230 “Aberdeen 1 Rangers NOTHING!!!!“Dens erupted and, as we walked down the stairs of the South Enclosure, ‘Hail, Hail The Dee Are Here’ rang out.“Dundee were two points ahead going into the final game.“So, on to the Saturday, and, upon waking, the first words I heard was my dad saying to my mother\u0026#8230 ‘It’s a glorious sunny day, we can’t fail.’“How true.“We journeyed through to Perth in my dad’s car in the company of my uncle and cousin.“I literally did not see one St Johnstone supporter among the Dark Blue masses.“The ground filled up quickly and my dad told me and my cousin to go down to the ‘dyke’ to get a better view.“The game unfolded just as you have heard and read a million times.“We are 3-0 up and the packed crowd are pushing down towards the ‘dyke’ in an attempt to get on to the pitch quickly to celebrate when the final whistle came.“I felt a bit crushed and uncomfortable at that point and a patrolling trackside policeman saw this and lifted me over.“As soon as my feet touched the ground, the ref blew\u0026#8230 and a tsunami of dark blue swamped on to the park.“I led the chase and just ran and ran.“I literally didn’t know where I was running to and ended up hugging skipper Bobby Cox on the halfway line.“There is an iconic photo of Bobby on the pitch being chaired by fans\u0026#8230 and I am somewhere in there under his backside!“We all just sang and danced and chanted and some of the Dundee players who got off the pitch eventually ventured into the main stand to received the plaudits.“We drove back to Dundee and went to a packed city square where the Dee players and officials were on view on the tiny balcony.“Compared to what would happen on such an occasion nowadays, it was really low-key.“As a delighted Dundee fan, I thought that this was the way it was always going to be\u0026#8230 but we now know otherwise!”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team bus, now every player will be together,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee bus firm to unveil new greener fleet with free wifi and usb charging","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee bus firm has unveiled a £4 million fleet of new vehicles that it hopes will be a breath of fresh air to locals.Xplore Dundee’s 14 low-emission “Emerald” buses, as the firm calls them, are double deckers built by Falkirk manufacturers Alexander Dennis Ltd.As well as packing modern tech such as free wifi, USB charging and “next stop” announcements, the buses come with low-pollutant hybrid engines that emit fewer greenhouse gases.The new vehicles were showcased at Discovery Point by Xplore’s new managing director Christine McGlasson to mark Clean Air Day.Ms McGlasson said the buses would be on the streets by the autumn.“We take our role in recognising and reducing our city’s air quality issues very seriously,” she said.“We are therefore actively embracing clean technology in our fleet because we want to run buses that are green inside and out. This is our message on Clean Air Day 2018 as we look to the future: buses are not part of the problem – they are the solution to pollution.”Dundee is one of several Scottish cities that will introduce Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in the near future.LEZs will prevent older vehicles that do not meet strict emissions standards from entering certain parts of the city, in order to improve air quality and people’s health in the process.Health Secretary and Dundee East MSP Shona Robison and Dundee City Council’s city development convener Lynne Short were also at Discovery Point today.Ms Robison said: “This is a great boost to Dundee’s environmental credentials and will help to make our city greener.”Ms Short added: “Everyone benefits from better air quality but it is also everyone’s responsibility to think about their individual or corporate contribution and having a national Clean Air Day helps to do that in a very specific way.”Xplore plans to deploy most of its new vehicles on the service 22 route, which uses the city’s Seagate – one of Scotland’s pollution hotspots, according to air quality studies.It’s the latest step undertaken in Dundee to reduce vehicle emissions.The council already offers perks to electric vehicle owners, while European funding secured 12 hydrogen buses for city fleets in March.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people octogenarian to graduate at

This will be Neil’s second year in charge and just like everything else he has a specific style he wants to play.“I think we saw, I would say, more than glimpses of it last year.“It is a style of play I think is entertaining to watch.“We have a very good young base to build on and I think if we build on that base it will be very exciting next year.”The 2017/18 campaign ended with a degree of disappointment as the Dark Blues fell short of their target.A ninth-placed finish kept them in the division and, with a year’s experience as a manager under his belt, Nelms is backing Neil to succeed with “just a few more pieces of the puzzle” needed to push Dundee to the top table in Scotland’s top flight.The American added: “Once again he can build on last season and with just a few more pieces of the puzzle we have quite a good picture going forward.“With what we’re doing with players at the moment and getting ready for pre-season, it seems like the season ended a week ago and all of a sudden we’re back.“This is the busiest time of the year for us, we are trying to get players in and do things to bolster the team and really get ready for the upcoming season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29ce2188d-453x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united boss csaba wont rush fyvie back early from serious injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo could wrap key midfielder Fraser Fyvie up in cotton wool for part of Dundee United’s pre-season build-up in a bid to make sure he’s fit for most of next season.Fyvie, who signed a new two-year contract recently, is still battling back from a serious knee injured that forced him to miss the second half of last season.And while the 25-year-old is keen to start full training when the new-look United squad report for work tomorrow after their summer break, Csaba may ease him back.He’s even prepared to see Fyvie miss the opening weeks of the season to make sure he’s 100% ready when he does return.“I hope, of course, he is ready soon but if by the end of September he is on the pitch I will be happy about it,” said Csaba.“He’s made a huge development. He is already OK and he wants to begin but I want him to take it a little bit easier because we want him for the long term, not two weeks.”Another of United’s long-term absentees from last term, James Keatings, will definitely be working with the rest of the squad right from the off tomorrow.The former Hearts and Hibs man has been out since early January because of a groin problem that required surgery.He’s been working over the summer, however, and is on course to be ready for the big kick-off next month.“Keatings is OK. Every second day he sends me a message saying I want to be training,” added Csaba.Still on the injury list are goalkeeper Deniz Mehmet and defender Lewis Toshney.Deniz will be out for several more months after his recent knee operation that followed the freak injury he suffered in the play-off win over Dunfermline last month, while Toshney’s condition will be assessed in the next week or so.He has yet to play under Csaba because of a knee problem that’s ruled him out since last October.“The one we don’t know how far on he is and is still in the recovery process is Toshney.“He’s made good steps forward but we have to see how the knee will react.”With eight new players and four fresh appointments to the coaching staff, there will be plenty new faces when the squad reports to their St Andrews training base tomorrow morning.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7124197d4-839x564.jpg ","title":"hidden costs of school day for hard up dundee families is laid bare","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe hidden costs of the school day for Dundee families have been laid bare in a new report.Dundee City Council recruited the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) charity to carry out a study on what could be done to reduce financial pressures on hard-up families.School uniforms, travel costs and even the hiring of musical instruments, are all proving to be economic barriers for kids.The report is based on work with pupils, staff and family members in schools and nurseries across Dundee.Pupils took part in two sessions which involved a case study featuring characters from low-income households. Kids were then asked to identify school costs which might create a barrier to participating in school.Among the issues addressed were breakfast clubs, uniform, lunches and snacks, school trips, homework and attitudes to poverty.The report found that uniform is one of the most expensive outlays for families, particularly replacing worn and torn clothes — and if families cannot afford to replace them, it can leave pupils embarrassed.Some pupils are also coming into school unfed – and inconsistencies in breakfast clubs across the city means that there aren’t always spaces for children in need.The timing of events, such as at Halloween and Christmas, was also leaving a dent in parents’ pockets, or leaving children excluded because their mums and dads can’t afford, for example, a Halloween costume.The Child Poverty Action Group, which conducted a similar exercise in Glasgow: “There is still some way to go to ensure that all children and young people from low income households are able to access all of the same opportunities as their peers.”One Dundee mum who knows how expensive it can be to send children to school is Sara Hay, 36, from Linlathen.Sara has one child Brandon Davidson in P1 at Rowantree Primary School and her son Findlay will start after the summer. She said: “There’s no doubt sending your kids to school is expensive. By the time you buy uniforms, shoes, bags and even pay for dress-down days, it’s a lot of money.“You often feel guilty because you maybe can’t afford to buy your children what others have, but it comes down to making the right choice.“Rowantree Primary is very good. We have a support group that runs a swap-shop, which is a great help. I also get support from my family.”Children and families service convener Councillor Gregor Murray said the report is a “hard-hitting” piece of research that raises a number of questions.Councillor Murray added said: “We raised the school clothing grant in Dundee to £100 in recognition of the struggles that families were facing.“Significant assistance from the Scottish Government has allowed us to make progress in narrowing the poverty attainment gap.“This report about the cost of the school day gives us many issues to think over and solutions need to be carefully considered.”The report highlights a number of examples of good practice to alleviate the economic barriers facing pupils.One of these is Craigie High School, where new first-year pupils are all given a pencil case filled with stationery so every youngster starts on the same footing.John Dickie, director of CPAG in Scotland, said: “Many Dundee schools and staff working in them are clearly sensitive to the fact that lots of families are struggling financially, and there is fantastic work happening across the city to keep school costs low and to support families where needed.“But cost barriers still remain and are preventing too many children from getting the most out of their education.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b713ac0e65-848x564.jpg ","title":"locals demand action over eyesore at old dundee nursery and play area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA “neglected” piece of land next to a disused building in Fintry has been branded an eyesore by angry residents.Grass, bushes and trees next to the former nursery school on Fintry Road have been left to grow for about a year, locals said today.The nursery closed nine years ago, and despite previous applications to convert the building, no plans have come to fruition.The council-owned land also houses play equipment.Elspeth Muir, 66, a domestic worker with NHS Tayside, has lived at Fintry Mills, overlooking the site, for more than 30 years. She said: “It’s a mess. Since the nursery closed it hasn’t really been maintained.“There were ideas for things to use the building but nothing ever happened and it’s just got worse since then.“Even if they just cut the grass it would make it a bit better to look at. The playpark was used occasionally but not any more.”Retired couple Katherine and Brian Perrie, who also live at Fintry Mills, said the extent of the overgrown land meant they no longer opened the windows at the back of their Abertay Housing Association property.They said the land was initially maintained when they moved in six years ago but it had become particularly overgrown in the past two years.Katherine, 67, added: “It’s been like that for a while.“As far as I can remember, the council has cut the grass once in about two years. It’s just a mess. We can’t open our windows now because you get all the insects and pollen from it.“It’s a disgrace to look out on to, just an eyesore. It was a nice view before, when it was maintained.”Brian, 70, said: “It used to be cut regularly but they’ve stopped for some reason.“It’s daft because the council cuts the grass at the front of the houses every fortnight, so it has the equipment and staff. It must just be budget cuts like everything else.“The last time it was cut was after I raised the issue with Abertay Housing Association, who reported it to the council.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “We will arrange for the grass to be cut as soon as possible.”The building served as a nursery for 50 years until it closed in 2009, and has remained empty since.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man admits exposing himself in dundee multi","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA 52-year-old man admitted that he committed a sexual act in a public area at Elders Court on December 7 last year, while on bail.Allan May, of Elders Court, also admitted that on October 29, at the same multi-storey building, he walked about in the main communal entrance while having the lower half of his body completely exposed, also while on bail.Sentence was deferred until July 17 and May was granted bail.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/09/57cfe1c2dde84-409x400.jpg ","title":"the tele guide to the world cup group hs local links","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first round of World Cup fixtures is almost over with Group H set to get under way today.Colombia might be the dark horses for the tournament and Poland boast one of the world\u0026#8217s top sharpshooters in Robert Lewandowski, Senegal have Liverpool\u0026#8217s Sadio Mane while Japan might have a former United keeper between the sticks.The Tele looks at the final set of countries and how they \u0026#8211 some tenuously \u0026#8211 are linked to both city clubs.GROUP HColombiaAnother nation with a golden generation, much is expected of this Colombia side back home.Four years ago, led by talisman James Rodriguez, they entertained their way to the quarter-final where they lost out to hosts Brazil in controversial fashion.This time around they find themselves in a group of unfancied teams which could give them the platform for another run into the knockout stages.With players like James, Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and Tottenham’s Davinson Sanchez, they possess quality throughout the squad.Star player: James Rodriguez.Local link: Colombia were invited to take on Scotland and England in the 1988 Rous Cup and arrived in the UK with stars like Carlos Valderrama, Rene Higuita and the tragic Andres Escobar, who was later murdered after scoring an own goal at the 1994 World Cup.A Dundee United player at the time, Kevin Gallacher played the full 90 minutes at Hampden as the teams played out a 0-0 draw and Scotland finished third out of three.JapanA mainstay of recent World Cups, Japan are looking to repeat their appearances in the knockout rounds in 2002 and 2010 after failing to win a game in 2014.With the experienced Keisuke Honda helped by former Manchester United man Shinji Kagawa, Japan have the guile to open teams up for Leicester’s Shinji Okazaki to finish.Star player: Shinji Kagawa.Local link: Dundee United fans won’t have fond memories of him – Dundee fans might – but goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima goes into this World Cup with the No 1 jersey.Signed by Mixu Paatelainen at Tannadice, Kawashima signed to regain his place in the national side but failed to perform as the club suffered relegation.The 35-year-old now plays for French top-flight club Metz.PolandThe Poles sailed to qualification for this one through a tough group that included Denmark, Montenegro and Romania thanks to a record goals haul of 16 by Robert Lewandowski.When they do qualify for World Cups, Poland tend to do well with two third-place finishes to their name.Those came in 1974 and 1982 but they’ve not made it out of the group stage since 1986.With one of the most lethal finishers in the tournament, they could surprise a few.Star player: Robert Lewandowski.Local link: Impressive goalkeepers have been the main export to the city from Poland for United but two outfielders come to mind at Dens.Dariusz Adamczuk and Pietor Czachowski arrived at Dundee in 1993 but couldn’t prevent relegation – Adamczuk would be fondly remembered in his second spell, returning in 1996 before departing for Rangers in 1999. He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15.

week on whether to suspend aberdeen msp mark mcdonald","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSenior politicians are expected to vote on Wednesday over whether or not to suspend Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald.Holyrood’s Standards Committee has recommended the former SNP minister be suspended for a month without pay after he was found to have twice breached the code of conduct for MSPs.The married father-of-two, who now stands as an independent MSP, said he accepted the findings of the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in relation to the two breaches.He added he would abide by the outcome of a full parliamentary vote on the proposed sanctions, expected to take place in the middle of next week.The commissioner was asked by the committee to investigate Mr McDonald’s conduct after SNP MSP James Dornan made an official complaint in March.The investigation concluded that a social media message he had sent to a female member of staff “involved sexual harassment” because it “contained sexual innuendo by association”.Responding to the decision, Mr McDonald admitted the message, to a female member of staff employed by another MSP, was “inappropriate”.But he added: “Analysis by my solicitor suggested that, while I accepted the message was inappropriate, it did not constitute sexual harassment.”Mr McDonald also admitted the second breach of the code of conduct for MSPs, that he failed to treat a member of staff with respect by asking her to make a payment of £476 for a flat deposit and not reimbursing her for around 24 days.The MSP said the delay arose from a “loss of perspective on his priorities” after a serious family health issue but said he accepted “entirely” that he was wrong.Mr Dornan had alleged the woman had been a “targeted victim of harassment and sexual innuendo” at the hands of Mr McDonald.However, the commissioner found no evidence to support some of the allegations made, including that he “skulked” about the parliament waiting for the woman and contributed to her ill-health.Mr McDonald said: “The manner in which Mr Dornan chose to publicise his complaint, and make lurid allegations against me, has had a significant and lasting impact upon my personal mental health and wellbeing, and has thus affected my family.”Mr Dornan said: “After having the heaviest ever sanction since the start of devolution recommended by the Standards Committee, I’d suggest Mr McDonald should concentrate on his own actions and consider his future as an MSP.“I’ll take no lessons nor have any interest in his opinions.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b2b617564919-940x559.jpg ","title":"wacky racers go for spin","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSchool pupils from across the north-east drove spectators wild at a soapbox car event.Forty schools from Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire put pedal to the metal in the race at the Grampian Transport Museum in Alford.The event, held by charity Green Power, offered pupils a way to learn STEM subjects in a practical way, by building an electric kit car, that was then raced against other schools.The kits were delivered to the school earlier in the year, and it was up to pupils and staff to put them together, complete with their own exterior designs.On the day, other than the races themselves, which take the form of drag, slalom and sprint events, the cars were judged on their body work, presentation and attitude.Macduff Primary School walked away as overall winners, seven points clear of their closest competitor, Airyhall Primary School.Gwen Sutherland, deputy head teacher at Macduff Primary, said: “There was a lot of preparation that went into it, from preparing the car, to planning the teams.“This is the third year that we did it, so we’ve built up a great knowledge of the event.”Gwen said race day “went really well”.She said: “The kids were very excited about it. It’s a fantastic opportunity for them.“The camaraderie between them was great, and they were working with the other schools that were there as well.“There was a real buzz.”The pupils didn’t feel like runaway winners during the competition, according to Gwen.She said: “They didn’t think they had won until their name was announced, so they were all shocked.“They worked really well as a team, and played to their strengths, which was great. Their behaviour was commendable.”Tony Scott, the Green Power ambassador at the Transport Museum, said: “It was a good day, we had to shorten the races because of the heavy rain, but it was a good day overall.“The kids really enjoyed the day as well.“I’m always surprised by how much the kids enjoy it, and they made memories that will last forever.“The most important thing is that it’s cross curricular, so if there’s a kid that’s not interested in the mechanical side, they can take part in something else, so it really does capture the whole curriculum across the school.”Tony believes that the event is “vital” for helping children understand STEM subjects. He said: “The kids get really engaged, so they’re doing schoolwork without having to do work.“It’s about getting them to do things that they don’t necessarily want to do.”A spokesman for the competition said: “We had the most teams ever participating with 40 schools attending.“Each school had their own unique take on their body work design and we would like to congratulate them as they each took part with great sportsmanship, despite the wet conditions.“It wouldn’t have been possible without our wonderful sponsor TAQA and their incredible volunteers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sloman knocks out red hot wilco at windy amateur championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“I don’t tend to play my home course when it’s this windy to be honest.“I stay home and play the Playstation”These were the words of Englishman Tom Sloman, 21, after he held his nerve best in the gale to reach the fourth round of the Amateur Championship at Royal Aberdeen.Sloman, a plus-four handicapper, saw off the week’s stand-out performer Wilco Nienaber by one hole yesterday after the big South African, 18, put his short par putt on the last just past the hole.The Taunton and Pickerage member, commenting of the blustery conditions at Balgownie and his great week so far – he was tied for 14th in the strokeplay stage at two-over – added: “I hit two wedges. One (on the second hole) was from 100 yards and it went 60 yards right.“I don’t think I’ve hit a bad shot.“It was a slug-fest out there today, but I was only four or five-over-par.“I didn’t have any expectations coming into this week and I always just try and play golf and it’s worked so far.”Sloman was set to take on another South African, Ernie Els’ nephew Jovan Rebula, in the quarter-finals today for a shot in the semis.It was a bad day for South Africa overall, with five of their players in the fourth round draw, but only one left at the end of play.Rebula beat Howley Hall’s Ben Hutchison by one hole to seal his progress.Elsewhere, Portmarnock’s Conor Purcell, after knocking out world number six Matthew Jordan by holing a 35-yard pitch from the rough on the 19th hole in the morning, defeated Adam Blomme of Sweden 3\u0026amp2.The 21-year-old Irishman, who grew up at Portmarnock, where his dad was pro, said his wonder pitch was “hit and hope”.The 58-degree wedge sent the ball over a bunker and then it rolled into the cup.After the later win, which sent him into the quarter-finals, Purcell said: “I’m surpassing whatever I thought I could I do, but I’ll keep playing my own game and see how things work out.“You can’t get ahead of yourself.”Purcell was set to take on David Micheluzzi, of Australia, today. The Royal Melbourne man beat Mexico’s Raul Pereda.Meanwhile, Filton’s Mitch Waite was set to play Sweden’s Christoffer Palsson and Tramore’s Robin Dawson was drawn against Kinsale’s John Murphy in all-Irish clash.Saturday’s winner over 36 holes at Royal Aberdeen is not only playing for an impressive trophy.A win in the 123rd edition of the competition will also them a place in the Open Championship and at next year’s Masters and US Open.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process. There will be the option of pre-registration for exhibits the automatic production of labelling for the paintings and photos instant printing of receipts and immediate production of a list of entries to guide visitors.As in past years, people who come to view the exhibition will have free entry, with the option of making a suitable donation to the funds of the society. There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply.

Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Borders Book Festival organisers say events going ahead  as normal ","story":"ORGANISERS of the Borders Book Festival have said\u0026nbspall events

colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

The Depute Procurator Fiscal said he believed the practice of young men going at night to farms was becoming very common, farms when the men were absent being singled out for attention and the conduct of the accused on this occasion was, to say the least, pretty bad.A number of farmers had informed him that their one objection to joining the Volunteer Force was that if they left the house at night occurrences of this kind were sure to take place.Theft of rhododendron bloomsA girl residing in Campbeltown was charged with having, on May 28 in the grounds adjoining the public road from Carradale Post Office to the pier, and beside the entrance gate to Carradale Stables, stolen two rhododendron blooms.Accused admitted taking the blooms but said she did not know they were private property.She had gone to Carradale to inquire after a situation and was returning to the ferry when she spotted the flowers and climbed over a wall to get them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"st columbas conventicle","story":"All religions have a mixture of good and bad points as do most political parties.When dealing with history, too, there are some literal truths, which both ministers at last Sunday\u0026#8217s Keil St Columba\u0026#8217s conventicle appeared to skip past.It was mentioned that the 6th century missionary based his teaching on a Bible written in Latin, but not that his name translated means \u0026#8216dove,\u0026#8217 a potent symbol of peace.In addition, at that time before the schism with Rome, St Columba, who also spoke Gaelic, offered the pagan hordes an education and health service rolled into one, with its roots in Europe.St Columba and his monks were the educated people of their time.While the medicine might well have been rudimentary, it was based on the learning of the Roman empire.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":null,"title":"Open-top tourist bus tours of East Lothian to start this summer","story":"              A NEW bus service that will serve East Lothian\u0027s tourist attractions will be launched at the end of the month.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times.

During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959926.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Welsh MPs sent information on applying to remain in UK after Brexit","story":"              Two Welsh MPs were sent an email from Sajid Javid explaining how they could apply for settled status in the UK after Brexit.

This most accessible of the Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is awash with blissed-out grandeur, each exquisite track creating a world all of its own.

Martin Williams  City to City, Gerry Rafferty, 1978.  Not so much for the two big hits, Baker Street and Right Down the Line, but more for Whatever\u0026rsquos Written in Your Heart. Rafferty at his introspective best.  Listen to City to City  A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984  Tinseltown in the Rain, of course, from the band\u0026rsquos debut album. There\u0026rsquos Killermont Street by Aztec Camera but Tinseltown is the ode to Glasgow.  On Stolen Stationary, Michael Marra, 1991  Hermless. Marra at his witty best. The ultimate self-effacing anthem for our national football team. Such mischievous fun, too.  Barclay McBain  Treasure, The Cocteau Twins, 1984  I was a devout follower of John Peel\u0026rsquos radio show, a late-night portal to a different dimension and it was here I first heard the strange, ethereal, beguiling sounds of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins, beamed through into my bedroom and my brain, like the best alien invasion ever. Not only was Liz from Earth, however, she was from Grangemouth, just down the road. After 30-odd years of listening, I still have absolutely no idea what she\u0026rsquos singing about, nor do I care. Just turn it up and let me dream.  Songs from Northern Britain, Teenage Fanclub, 1997  A long, long time ago, at a festival not too far from here, a man thrust a microphone in my face and asked me what Teenage Fanclub meant to me. In the second it took me to open my mouth to reply, they vanished. Collecting my thoughts from the comfort of a chemical toilet, I mused on the question. They are the band equivalent of your best friend, a constant. Always there, always dependable, the soundtrack to your greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats, they have your back, always ready with a smile and a hug. Cheers, pals.    The Three EPS, The Beta Band, 1998  Ok, so technically not an album, but three EPs gathered together for your listening pleasure. When John Cusack\u0026rsquos character in the film High Fidelity puts the Three Eps in his record shop, customers stop in their tracks. What\u0026rsquos this? they ask, \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos good! To which Cusack replies, smugly, I know. If only everyone did.  Lian Thomson  Sulk, The Associates, 1982  Of course, as any fool knows, 1982 is the annus mirabilis of Scottish pop (the fact that I was 19 that year may or may not be related). Above all else there was Sulk, the highpoint of new pop (alongside ABC\u0026rsquos Lexicon of Love), and Dundee\u0026rsquos finest gift to the culture. Alan Rankine and Billy McKenzie made pop music that was wilder, stranger and, yes, sexier, than everyone else that year. Party Fears Two is a song that is a song that teeters on the cusp of madness and is giddy at the very thought of it. It\u0026rsquos not even the best thing on the album.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Because I believe every word she sings.  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  Presuming that Lloyd Cole\u0026rsquos Commotion-less albums don\u0026rsquot qualify (if they did, then Don\u0026rsquot Get Weird on Me would be a shoo-in), let\u0026rsquos go with the second album from Ayrshire\u0026rsquos finest exports. I\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos better than their precocious debut Cake, but the bittersweet autumnal yearning of Earlies is the most gorgeous Scottish song no one has heard of.  Teddy Jamieson  This Is The Story, The Proclaimers, 1987  Its seminal track Letter From America was a soaring cry of solidarity for beleaguered working class communities across Scotland. The line \u0026ldquoBathgate no more \u0026ndash referring to the British Leyland plant which closed in 1984 \u0026ndash made this West Lothian youngster feel like someone was listening.  Listen to\u0026nbspLetter from America:\u0026nbsp  Popped In Souled Out, Wet Wet Wet, 1987  Ah, heady gems such as Wishing I Was Lucky, Angel Eyes and Sweet Little Mystery crooned by dreamboat Marti Pellow (err, what? I was nine). I played this album so often that the tape inside the cassette stretched and snapped. I saved up my pocket money and bought another.  The Hush, Texas, 1999  It was the soundtrack to my first newspaper job as a trainee reporter at the Basingstoke Gazette, the smoky-voiced tones of Sharleen Spiteri \u0026ndash singing Summer Son and In Our Lifetime \u0026ndash played through the tinny headphones of my Sony Discman.    Susan Swarbrick  All You Need Is\u0026hellip.Love and Money, Love and Money, 1986  Because it was the first album I ever owned (on cassette) because I loved James Grant\u0026rsquos voice and because it was a bit edgy and angry and I wasn\u0026rsquot either of those things, normally. It made me feel a bit dangerous.  Fruits of Passion, Fruits of Passion, 1987  A sadly-neglected pure pop classic \u0026ndash why oh why, did this wonderful band get left behind when the likes of Texas, Deacon Blue and Del Amitri soared? Pure, perfect vocals and singalong joy.  Listen to Kiss Me Now  Creeping up on Jesus, The Big Dish, 1988  I know it wasn\u0026rsquot as well received as their first album, Swimmer, but I always liked the happy, poppy feel of this one and it reminds me of driving around the north of Scotland in the summer sunshine with my love, when we were young and free as birds\u0026hellip  Ann Fotheringham  Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991  It was not their first album, but Bandwagonesque thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is this Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  The Beta Band, The Three Eps, 1998  Though technically a compilation, this laid out their manifesto more than any album from this cult Scots combo \u0026ndash a gloriously languid, ramshackle assembly of loose, off-kilter tunes, embroidered with hints of funk and electronica. They have never sounded better.  Music Has The Right To Children, Boards of Canada, 1998  The debut album of Scots electronic duo Boards of Canada is, for many, the high watermark for ambient electronic music. Two decades on from its release, its influence continues to be recognised and celebrated \u0026ndash and rightly so.  Scott Wright  Screamadelica, Primal Scream, 1991  It sounded in 1991 like it was made in the future and in 2018 it could have been recorded yesterday. Movin\u0026rsquo on Up really ought to be the national anthem. Stands out on its own.  Listen to Loaded  Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub, 1995  Bellshill meets the US West Coast with predictably dreamy results. There is not a weak track on it and some of the lyrics would make a statue well up.  Psychocandy, The Jesus and Marychain, 1985  It wasn\u0026rsquot all madness and fighting in the Reid family. This album sees them flirt with the Beach Boys and, pun intended, they pull it off. Just Like Honey is perfection.  Neil Cameron  The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008  A decision to avoid albums detailing the painful end of a long-term relationship after the end of my own stopped me listening to Midnight Organ Fight for a few years, but diving back in was like meeting an old friend in the pub. It\u0026rsquos painful but cathartic. Like all of the late Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.  I Am An Island, Fatherson, 2014  My first experience of drinking alcohol was at a Fatherson gig in our hometown of Kilmarnock circa 2009, so their music has always been riddled with nostalgia for me. Their debut album is special because it taps into that difficult phase of growing up in, and moving out of, a small town that can sometimes feel desperate to pull you back.  The Bones of What You Believe, Chvrches, 2013  The juxtaposition of pop melodies and dark lyrics is the USP of this album, which can be appreciated on both a surface level and deeper, with every move having been intricately created by the three musicians. Lauren Mayberry brings a new a level of vulnerability to the genre which makes Chvrches stand out from the rest.  Holly Lennon  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Heartache, the joy of human connection and a love letter to rainy Glasgow by night from a voice wrought with emotion. I\u0026rsquom forever grateful to my brother, Ewen, for the first hearing of the Downtown Lights, beyond his bedroom door.  Garbage, Garbage, 1995  Thrilling soundtrack to the giddy, alcohol-fuelled anticipation of student nights out, sung by the first cool ginger frontwoman I had ever seen.  These Streets, Paolo Nutini, 2006  The ache of leaving home and impermanence of first love refreshingly articulated in Nutini\u0026rsquos Paisley brogue with a maturity beyond his years.    Caroline Wilson  Solid Air, John Martyn, 1973  Superb guitar playing, great songs and Martyn\u0026rsquos trademark slurred jazzy vocals make this a fascinating album, like nothing we\u0026rsquod ever heard before. Martyn had star quality and talent in abundance but he also had a self-destructive streak and simply did what he liked, on and off stage, and never made the \u0026ldquobig time. He made other great albums, notably One World, but this is him at his peak.  Listen to Solid Air  White Album, Average White Band, 1974  Great songs, astonishing double lead vocal from Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, fabulous funky drumming from Robbie McIntosh and the Dundee Horns of Ball on Pick Up The Pieces, this topped both the UK and US charts. Black American artists couldn\u0026rsquot believe the band were white, never mind Scottish, when they heard it. Still a classic 44 years on.  Sunshine on Leith, The Proclaimers, 1988  A clutch of superb self-written songs, the Reid twins singing in their own accents (very unusual back then), a great session band and Pete Wingfield\u0026rsquos sensitive production turned this into a classic. Hell, they even made a musical and film based on it. Thirty years on and we\u0026rsquore still singing along with the choruses.  Frank Morgan  Exploited, Troops of Tomorrow, 1982  \u0026ldquoSomething\u0026rsquos happened/what\u0026rsquos gone wrong/Going down the dole/got to sign on/Millions of kids with nowt to do/You better watch out they\u0026rsquore after you. It\u0026rsquos 1982, the country is falling apart and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Wattie Buchan and Big John Duncan have the perfect response. Fast, angry, hardcore punk.  Twilight Sad, Forget the Night Ahead, 2009  An uncompromising post-rock wall of sound, with uncompromising Scottish accents. Like nothing I\u0026rsquod heard before. What The Proclaimers would sound like if they were a Chem19 band channelling Nine Inch Nails.  Test Dept, Brith Gof, Gododdin, 1989  Pipes and drums and tribal soul \u0026ndash this was the sound of Europe\u0026rsquos ancient minorities refusing to fade away. Angus Farquhar\u0026rsquos finest musical moment before coming a full-time arts revolutionary with NVA.  Garry Scott  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  Avocet, Bert Jansch, 1979  One for the diaspora. Released as punk morphed into post-punk and new wave, the Edinburgh-born guitarist\u0026rsquos 12th studio album came from another world entirely. Around the theme of wading birds he weaves a fabric of folk, jazz and improvised playing that never loses its capacity to enthral.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove Spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Irrefutable evidence that the best music doesn\u0026rsquot belong to the distant past, Glasgow-based Aberdonian Kathryn Joseph\u0026rsquos hard-won success with her debut was fuelled in equal measure by her powerfully emotional music, glorious enthusiasm and unwillingness to mask the fact that when you reach 40 there\u0026rsquos some baggage you either can\u0026rsquot or don\u0026rsquot want to leave behind, so best use it to stoke the fire of creativity.

Mr Yousaf met with Common Weal earlier this year \u0026ndash just months before he is due to make an announcement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans for a public sector bid to take over the railways.  He initiated the meeting with the left-wing \u0026ldquothink and do tank to discuss a paper it produced with the transport union TSSA, which also suggested creating a unified public transport body for Scotland\u0026rsquos buses, trains, trams and ferries.  The document, entitled A Public Future for Scotland\u0026rsquos Railways, argues the current franchise system should be abolished to prevent the railways being taken back into private ownership if a public bid takes over.  It states: \u0026ldquoWhile the system of tendering out time-limited contracts for operating Scotland\u0026rsquos railways remains, even the most popular and efficient public-sector operator will suffer from the lack of certainty which inhibits long-term thinking in the railways today, as it would face the very real prospect of losing its right to operate the franchise every five to ten years.  \u0026ldquoIn order to allow us to enjoy the full rewards publicly-run railways have the potential to bring, the Scottish Government should seek the power to abolish the franchise system, and instead allow ScotRail to be operated permanently on a public-sector basis.  The paper argues \u0026ldquomuch of the transformative potential of the idea of publicly-run railways in Scotland relies on it being a permanent break with decades of privatisation and market-oriented policy.  It references the InterCity East Coast franchise, which was run by a state-owned operator between 2009 and 2015, and argues a publicly-owned rail company could make substantial cuts to ticket prices.  It also suggests three governance models: a new public arm\u0027s-length rail company, a unified public transport body, or a co-operative partially owned by workers and passengers.  In an entry on Holyrood\u0026rsquos lobbying register, Common Weal writes: \u0026ldquoWe were asked to provide our advice and opinion on [the] plans and to offer suggestions as to what other aspects of the recommendations in our paper could be prioritised.  Dr Craig Dalzell, head of policy and research at the think tank, said Mr Yousaf had been interested in \u0026ldquothe report in the round.  The transport minister is currently preparing a bid to take over the railways, with a statement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans due within days.  A public-sector bid by state-owned ferry operator CalMac is understood to be one of the favoured options.  But current operator Abellio has repeatedly said it would have \"no problem competing with a public bid\".  Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the meeting with Common Weal \u0026ldquoshould send alarm bells ringing.  He said: \u0026ldquoSeeking views of this type simply signals that instead of just pushing for a public operator to run our railways, the transport minister is in fact open to full monopolised nationalisation, at any cost.  He added: \u0026ldquoTenders and franchises offer a transparent process which get the best available operator at the best cost to the public purse.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur consistent view over many years is that there ought to be a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises.  \u0026ldquoIt is vital that we take the time to think through the various scenarios as ministers want to enable a competitive public sector bid which offers best value for the public purse while delivering continuous service improvements. We expect to give an update on this over the coming weeks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP government budget underspend almost   500m","story":"              THE Scottish Government underspend was almost half a billion pounds last year, prompting claims of mismanagement and ministers sitting on an unused \u0026ldquoslush fund.  The figure was more than twice the \u0026pound191m underspend of the year before.  Announcing the outturn figure for 2017-18, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs the fiscal budget had been \u0026pound31.4bn, but expenditure \u0026pound30.9bn.  However he stressed most of the unspent money was already committed, including \u0026pound100m for a new social security system, and all the money would be spent by the Scottish Government, not returned to the Treasury.  He said that for the second year running, income from devolved taxes was up, with total provisional income from Land \u0026amp Buildings Transactions Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax reaching \u0026pound706m, \u0026pound50m above forecasts, and \u0026pound73 million, or 12 per cent, up on 2016-2017.  He said that the net extra being carried forward into 2018/19 was \u0026pound66m, or just 0.2 per cent of the overall fiscal budget, and that this would be done through the Scotland Reserve pot, making it available \u0026ldquoto support management of future budget volatility.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe 2017-18 provisional outturn results show that once again the Scottish Government has prudently and competently managed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances.  \u0026ldquoUnder the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Parliament is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling public expenditure to ensure we live within the budget control limits that apply.  \u0026ldquoThese underspends represent a fraction of our overall budget, but will be carried forward to support this year\u0026rsquos budget and increase our reserves.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to maintain a firm grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos public finances to mitigate the negative impact Brexit will have on Scotland\u0026rsquos economic outlook.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend was \u0026ldquonothing short of a scandal, given ministers had cut \u0026pound1.5bn from councils since 2011, and demanded Mr Mackay apologise to workers facing the axe while he sat on an \u0026ldquoSNP government slush fund.  He said: \u0026ldquoMoney is piling up in his slush fund for his annual bribe to win Green votes to get his budgets passed.  \u0026ldquoThis is simply a gross mismanagement of the Scottish finances by a Finance Secretary who is clearly out of his depth. Derek Mackay must apologise to communities across Scotland that have been damaged by his reckless actions.  Tory Murdo Fraser added: \u0026ldquoDerek Mackay might like to fool us all into thinking this \u0026pound453m underspend figure is an insignificant sum. But it\u0026rsquos higher than what the SNP\u0026rsquos independence blueprint [Growth Commission] said it would cost to create a separate state.  \u0026ldquoThe finance secretary is having to put money aside to meet a projected shortfall in tax revenues due to Scottish economic underperformance."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7957319.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots hotel adds midge burgers  delicacy  to the menu as  a bit of fun ","story":"              A SCOTS hotelier has claims to have created a burger from midges which has he describes as a \"delicacy\" that has proved surprisingly popular with guests.  David Keat, who owns the Brander Lodge Hotel at\u0026nbspTaynuilt, Argyll and Bute\u0026nbspsays the secret vegan recipe has been added to the menu to\u0026nbsptheir Crunachy Bistro and has posted photographs of their creation on social media.  The hotel has declared that it has \"taken sourcing ingredients locally\" to a new extreme by \"adding north-western Scotland\u0027s annual blight of midges to its menu\".  The secret recipe is said to incorporate\u0026nbspsweet potato, local nettles and traditional herbs such as parsley and rosemary.    While admitting the idea began as a joke Mr Keat\u0026nbspannounced: \"Every summer we\u0027re absolutely over-run with the little beggars.  \"We\u0027ve installed several midge machines here on site and every few days we have to empty them, which got me thinking.  \"All sorts of other insects and bugs are crawling onto menus all over the world, so there\u0027s no reason why the humble midge should be excluded. If you can\u0027t beat \u0027em, eat \u0027em.\"  Although the move is said to be being considered by Argyll Council\u0027s environmental health department, Mr Keat\u0026nbspclaims\u0026nbsphe has already served the burgers to guests.    \"Initially some of our guests were a bit anxious about trying the delicacy, but soon enough they were raving, and now we simply can\u0027t supply demand which has outstripped the capacity of our commercial sized midge whackers.  \"We\u0027ve had to ask neighbours to put more machines on their properties as well, but we still can\u0027t keep up,\" he said on a Facebook update.  One Facebook user questioned the announcement saying: \"Is this for real? Surely not. Don\u0027t these things go around sucking blood out of people and animals?\"  The hotel responded saying: \"It\u0027s just a bit of fun.\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"Michael Gove  SNP are following in my footsteps with post-Brexit plans","story":"              MICHAEL Gove has insisted SNP ministers are following in his footsteps with their plans for farming after the UK leaves the European Union.  The UK Environment Secretary said proposals for a five-year transition period in which farming subsidies would continue after Brexit were \u0026ldquotaking a leaf out of his department\u0026rsquos book.  It comes as Scottish Secretary David Mundell accused the SNP of mining \u0026ldquofake grievance\", despite engaging positively with UK ministers behind the scenes.  Earlier this week, the SNP outlined post-Brexit plans for Scottish farmers that would see subsidies kept in place and Brussels red tape slashed over a five-year transition period.  It said the proposals went further than the UK Government, which has said all subsidies provided by the EU will continue until the end of the current parliamentary term in 2022.  But visiting the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, Mr Gove said: \"I think they\u0027re taking a leaf out of our book.  \"They understand that life outside the European Union means you can remove some bureaucracy from the lives of farmers, and that has to be a good thing.\"  He insisted the UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the future of farming had been very well received, adding: \" I think [that] suggests the path that we want to take agriculture south of the border is one that\u0027s got universal support.  \"Here in Scotland we respect the fact there is a devolved administration that will make its own decisions, but it\u0027s encouraging that the direction of travel the Scottish Government wants to take is one that\u0027s following in our footsteps.\"  Mr Gove also pledged that Scottish farmers would always receive \u0026ldquospecial treatment because they face unique challenges.  He was questioned about a long-anticipated review into the distribution of EU farm subsidies between Scotland and the rest of the UK, amid claims Scottish hill farmers are owed \u0026pound160m from the Treasury.  He said: \"We\u0027re going to make sure that Scotland receives the support that it needs in the future.  \"And we\u0027re going to make sure that the unique circumstances of Scotland\u0027s geography and Scotland\u0027s farming sector are reflected in the allocations that we make in the future.\"  Mr Gove said he hoped an Agriculture Bill detailing the UK Government\u0027s plans for farming post-Brexit would be published at the end of July.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the message from the SNP at Westminster was \u0026ldquolets weaponise Brexit as an opportunity to take forward independence.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe complete and utter myth that agricultural powers were going to be seized by the UK government has at least this week been shot down completely."},{"url":null,"title":"Treasury is not the   39 enemy of Brexit   39  insists Hammond","story":"              THE Treasury is not the \"enemy of Brexit\" but will be Britain\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquochampion of prosperity outwith the European Union, Philip Hammond has insisted.  The Chancellor used his annual Mansion House speech to City figures in London to confront attacks from Brexiteer critics, who have condemned the financial department on his watch.  In front of an audience including Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Mr Hammond said the Treasury would be the \"champion of prosperity for the British people\" after Brexit but it would be \"working and trading closely\" with the EU.  His words followed a secret recording of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, who was heard describing the financial heart of the UK Government as \"basically the heart of Remain\".  As well as recognising Britain\u0027s EU membership since 1973 and the importance of trade, the Chancellor said the post-Brexit landscape should reflect the scale of goods travelling between Dover and Calais, continental defence and security co-operation and \"centuries of shared history and culture\".  He explained: \"So as we leave the EU we need to forge a new relationship with our European neighbours that protects those patterns of trade those business relationships that have been painstakingly built over decades...that maintains low friction borders and open markets.  \"That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, \u0027the enemy of Brexit\u0027 rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU but working and trading closely with it.  \"And part of that successful future partnership must be a mechanism that enables UK EU financial services trade to continue delivering the benefits of open markets and deep regulatory co-operation.  \"Of course, we recognise that this will be a new kind of relationship, reflecting a new, and fair, balance of rights and responsibilities.\"  At the start of June, Theresa May said she had full confidence in Mr Johnson after he told a private dinner there was a risk Brexit \"will not be the one we want\" and would keep the UK \"locked in orbit\" around the EU.  At the gathering of the Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite campaign group, he claimed negotiations were approaching a \"moment of truth\" and warned of a Brexit \"meltdown\".  That followed criticism from Priti Patel, the former International Trade Secretary, who accused the Chancellor and the Prime Minister of \"negativity\" and urged a \"better vision for the future\" after Brexit.  Mr Carney used his own speech on Thursday night to say he believed an \"ambitious\" financial services relationship with the EU - founded on commitments to achieving equivalent outcomes and supervisory cooperation - remained \"feasible\".  Echoing the Government\u0027s mantra of a post-Brexit \"global\" Britain, he said: \"Having put in place the pillars of responsible, open financial system, we are ready for deeper global financial partnerships with the emerging economies that will be the most important drivers of global growth in the decades ahead.\"  To this end, the Bank would deepen its supervisory co-operation with major emerging economies and develop infrastructure to support cross-border capital flows, he explained.  Mr Carney said it also wanted to help enable UK households and businesses to transact \"anywhere, anytime with anyone whether around the corner or around the world\".  The Canadian used the speech to say that financial services could serve as a template for broader services trade liberalisation.  Responding the Chancellor\u0027s \u0026pound1.2 billion capital injection onto the Bank\u0027s balance sheet, alongside reforms to its framework, the Governor said: \"We now have a balance sheet fit for purpose. One that reflects the Bank\u0027s much wider range of responsibilities including banking supervision, macro-prudential policy and resolution. And the framework enhances our independence, transparency and accountability.\"  The Chancellor also used his speech to announce the creation of a Green Finance Institute based in the capital, jointly funded by government and the City of London.  He also said a Financial Services Skills Taskforce would be set up by TheCityUK, led by former City Minister Mark Hoban, to \"meet the long-term skills needs of the sector over the coming decades and creating opportunities for the next generation\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7958073.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Forgotten history of the  Glasgow Serbs  who took rugby home","story":"              THEY came to Scotland with little more than the clothes upon their backs, refugees from a war which set the continent of Europe ablaze.  Yet when they finally left for home years later, they returned not as heroes of the battlefield but as the conquerors of the rugby pitch, taking a their knowledge of the game back to their native Serbia, where it has flourished.  Most gained their love for the oval ball during a stay at George Heriots School in Edinburgh, where they are fondly remembered.  But now, on the centenary of their greatest triumph, the story of the Serbian rugby boys of Glasgow has been brought to light by a historian of the game in their native country.    Serbia\u0026nbspsuffered greatly during World War One  In August 1916, 27 boys aged between 12 and 19 arrived in Scotland traumatised and bewildered after the tide of war swept over Serbia.  Their home country had held out bravely against the might of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, but had finally been defeated by the combined forces of Germany, Bulgaria and Imperial troops.  More than 100,000 people died fleeing across the Albanian mountains, and the boys were among the weary refugees who survived, arriving in Britain by boat from Corfu.

The youngsters talent for the sport and athletics was quickly noticed, and soon they were introduced to rugby.  Within months, three were playing for the Heriot\u0027s highly regarded first team alongside future Scotland internationals, while in Glasgow 18 were quickly drafted into the teams in their schools.  Many of this group would go on to have substantial careers on the rugby field, according to Slavisa Milenkovic, Secretary of the Krusevac rugby club in Serbia, who has researched their time in Scotland.  He said: \"The Serbian rugby team in Edinburgh was the largest, most organized and of the highest quality, but their story ended in June 1919 when they were left the city.  \"But, the Serbs also played rugby in other Scottish cities they were located in during the First World War, and the best Serbian rugby players performed in Glasgow.\"  In 1918, the boys from Edinburgh and Glasgow formed the first Serbian national team, winning a match played in Edinburgh in front of a crowd of more than 8,000.  This was the first team to even play under the Serbian flag and is still held as the genesis of rugby for the Balkan country.  The same year a group also travelled to Ayr and beat a team from the local Academy, their arrival heralded in a newspaper report entitled \"The Visit of the Serbian Boys\".

The best-known of the Serbs was Slavoljub Djordjevic, who went on to play more than 100 games in Scottish competitions, first for Hillhead and later for Glasgow University Blues, where he studied to be a doctor.    Slavoljub Djordjevic/Stevan George  Djordjevic, a successful fullback, later married a Scottish woman and changed his name to Stevan George. He served as a ship\u0027s surgeon on troop transports during the Second World War and later worked as a doctor on board Cunard liners, eventually settling in the Bahamas.  Mr George, a father-of-three, was later awarded an OBE for his services to the Island communities, died in Nassau aged 67.  Another who enjoyed a long career was Dragoljub Stojanovic, who was a frequent turn-out for Hillhead between 1920 to 1926, playing at all levels.  In Edinburgh, Dimitrije Dulkanovic, who was known as the school\u0027s \"flying wing three-quarter\", also went on to train as a doctor, and set up the country\u0027s first rugby club in Belgrade.  Dr Dulkanovic died in 1995, aged 95, and was buried in his old school tie. He was one of five of the Serbian Herioters to attend the school\u0027s tercentenary in 1959, and continued to visit into the 1980s.

Colin McCallum, vice president of Heriot\u0026rsquos Rugby Club, who made the trip, said that the tale of the Serbians who came to Edinburgh was well remembered by his old school and .  However, the contribution of those who picked up the game in Glasgow has been largely lost to history.  Mr McCallum said: \"The rugby played in Serbia is a direct descendant of the rugby they played in Scotland, particularly at Heriots, and they are very mindful of that.  \"It\u0027s very touching. But we had not realised the contribution made by the Glasgow boys, and it\u0027s very interesting.  \"There was no mention of Hillhead during the presentation, although Heriots was brought up a number of times.\"  Today, the link between Glasgow and Serbia remains, with the Skipper of the Serbian national team, flanker Milan Marinkovi\u0026#263, and hooker Istok Totic playing for Cartha Queens Park RFC.

Earlier this week, the Nationalist leader in the Commons intensified the political rhetoric when he denounced the Scottish Secretary as \u0026ldquoyellow for not speaking in a debate and a \u0026ldquodismal failure in his role at the Scotland Office.  He accused Mr Mundell of \u0026ldquostabbing Scotland in the back over the devolved powers controversy, declaring: \u0026ldquoHe fails to stand up for Scotland as a country, fails to stand up for our Parliament, he sees us as subservient. That\u0027s why the Secretary of State needs to go. He is quite simply unfit for the office he holds.\"  Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos remarks came just days after he was ordered from the Commons by the Speaker and led a mass walkout of SNP MPs from the chamber.  Following the dramatic event, Mr Salmond, who himself walked out of the Commons during Chancellor Nigel Lawson\u0026rsquos 1988 Budget statement, suggested he had been the SNP\u0026rsquos inspiration by telling the party leader that targeting interventions on key occasions was the way to make a successful protest.  \"Certainly, that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through,\" explained the former First Minister.  But when the Highland MP was asked if Mr Salmond was pulling the party leadership\u0026rsquos strings at Westminster, he responded with a firm \u0026ldquoNo.  Mr Blackford also insisted his angry remarks directed at Mundell were not meant to be personal.  \u0026ldquoI was robust in how I spoke because the Secretary of State has failed to defend Scotland at every turn, he has been a complete failure, he declared.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot wish to be personal about the Secretary of State but on the lack of ability in serving Scotland\u0026rsquos interest, as defined by the Government itself, it is not good enough.  The party leader made clear he had not accused individual MPs of being \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish but, rather, Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government.  A Whitehall insider suggested the SNP leadership was losing the argument on the Brexit Bill, which was why it was resorting to \u0026ldquocheap personal attacks.  Meanwhile, as Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, and Michael Russell, her Brexit Minister, headed for Guernsey to attend the British-Irish Council, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, who will also be at the meeting, stressed how, despite the strong disagreements with Edinburgh over the Brexit Bill, the UK Government was committed to improving the depth of its co-operation with the SNP administration.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the inevitable political noise as we unpick the complexities of our membership of the EU, I will ensure that we maintain the depth of our ongoing engagement with the Scottish Government, including this week at the British-Irish Council in Guernsey. I hope that the Scottish Government will maintain their own side of that relationship.  He added: \u0026ldquoBy working together, we will help secure a deal that sees us leave the European Union as a more modern country where all four nations have their voices heard but also as one United Kingdom as the people of Scotland voted for in 2014."},{"url":null,"title":"Younger generation has little chance of becoming wealthy  report claims","story":"              Young people today have less chance of becoming truly wealthy than any previous post-war generations, according to a new report.  Whether or not they inherit sizeable assets from parents or other relatives will be the most important factor determining their eventual wealth, rather than ability or effort, analysts from the Resolution Foundation claim.  The report says big falls in home ownership rates since are a key factor in the wealth gap for young adults. Home ownership rates fell from 48 per cent in 2003 to 32 per cent today.  Typical Scottish wealth now totals \u0026pound237,000 per household, and the total household wealth in Scotland has now exceeded \u0026pound1 trillion for the first time, the report says.  Overall wealth in Scotland has grown from five times GDP to seven times GDP over the last decade, much faster than incomes which makes it harder to close wealth gaps by earning and saving.  Even a high income family, in the top ten per cent of households with a \u0026pound58,000 income would have to save every penny they earn for 19 years to become \"truly wealthy\" \u0026ndash with assets of over \u0026pound1 million\u0026ndash the report says.  But the reality is 25 per cent of Scots have savings of less than \u0026pound500, and seven per cent have savings of zero, or have current accounts in the red.  The Foundation is calling for politicians to take more account of wealth in policy-making and debates, and said that while reforms of council tax were welcome, it is one of the most significant wealth taxes. As it is devolved, the Scottish Government could do more to make it more accurately reflect property values, the report says.  Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution foundation, said: \"Wealth in Scotland has grown fast in recent years and will come to play a bigger role in determining life chances in the decades to come.  \"This increase in wealth across Scotland has sat alongside falling home ownership rates, particularly for young families, who are struggling to accumulate wealth as preceding generations have been able to.\"  As a result the \u0027millennial\u0027 generation could be the first since the second world war to earn less than their parents over their lifetime.  \"The accumulation, distribution and taxation of wealth should be at the centre of policy debates in Scotland in the years ahead,\" Mr Bell added. \"If current trends continue it will become much harder in modern Scotland to earn your way to being truly wealth, and young people\u0027s prospects will depend lesson their ability and more on whether or not they inherit assets from relatives.\"  Neil Brennan, director of Fitzallan Ltd, Glasgow-based Chartered Financial Planners\u0026rsquo, said: \"Compared to previous generations, younger people typically stay at home longer, join the job market later and have very high expectations as to standard of living.\"  Many use disposable income for cars, holidays, leisure activities and fashion their parents might have done without, he said. \"Younger generations find it difficult to bridge the \u0026lsquowealth gap\u0026rsquo as they have low savings/high spending habits and do not get onto the housing market as early as their parents.\"  Pension auto-enrolment will help, but young people are starting work later and still do not begin saving for retirement as early as their parents did, he added.  \"As a financial adviser, we would encourage young people to save or investor contribute to pensions, even at modest levels, to get the \u0026lsquopot boiling\u0026rsquo.  \"Many younger people will have to rely on inheritances, even modest ones, to allow them to pay off their mortgages or retire before they are very old.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Poll  UK wants second EU referendum","story":"              ALMOST half of voters want a second referendum on Brexit, according to a new poll released on the eve of the second anniversary of the historic vote to leave the EU.  And the survey for ITV1\u0027s Good Morning Britain suggested that a fresh poll would produce a very different outcome, with the UK voting to remain in the EU by a margin of 53% to 47%.  The projected result effectively reverses the referendum of June 23 2016, when Leave took 53% of votes, compared to 48% support for Leave.  Pollsters Survation found that 48% of those questioned wanted a second referendum on the final Brexit deal, against just 25% who did not. Some 18% said they did not have an opinion and 9% did not know.  Those supporting a new referendum included 35% of Leave voters and 66% of those who back Remain.  The survey found that 43% of voters back a \"soft Brexit\" - in which the UK would stay in both the single market and customs union - while 37% favour a \"hard Brexit\" in which Britain would leave both.  Some 57% of 2017 Labour voters backed a soft Brexit, against 23% who prefer a hard version.  Almost half (47%) of more than 1,000 people questioned thought leaving the EU without a deal would be bad for Britain, compared to 32% who said it would be good for Britain.  Only 35% of people said Brexit would be good for the UK economy, while 39% said it would be bad.  Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People\u0027s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: \"This new polling shows just how much momentum is building behind the campaign for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal.  \"This Saturday will see tens of thousands from all over the UK marching for a People\u0027s Vote in London and support is growing across the country.  \"With the negotiations in chaos, with the Government making a total mess of Brexit and with Parliament paralysed, now is the time for people to take back control of the process.\"  Eloise Todd of the Best for Britain campaign said: \"MPs from all parties risk being two years out of date.

Just 17% of those taking part could identify the correct definition of the customs union, while 38% chose the correct description of the single market.  Nearly two-fifths (39%) said they had a \u0027limited\u0027 understanding of the issues around the Irish border, while a further fifth (19%) said that they didn\u0027t know anything about or hadn\u0027t heard of the issue.  Some 40% thought Brexit would make the relationship between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland more distant, compared to 30% who thought it would make no difference and 10% that it would make the relationship closer.

Mike Russell said the Scottish Government no longer trusted UK ministers following a breakdown in relations over the handling of the EU Withdrawal Bill.  He added that he \"couldn\u0027t conceive of circumstances\" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.  MPs approved parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill related to devolution after less than 20 minutes of debate last week, despite the Scottish Parliament voting against granting formal consent for the Bill.

Official statistics show 26 of Scotland\u0026rsquos 32 local authorities intend to draw on their general reserves in the current financial year, up from 24 last year.  Seven councils - Clackmannanshire, Eilean Siar, Moray, West Dunbartonshire and East, South and North Ayrshire - plan a second year of double-digit raids in percentage terms.  In the most extreme case, Moray, which has been beset by political instability, plans to use 31.5 per cent of its reserves in 2018-19, after using 30.5 per cent in 2017-18.  Earlier this year the Accounts Commission said it was \"seriously concerned\" about acute financial problems at Clackmannanshire, and said using reserves to avoid difficult political decisions was \u0026ldquounsustainable.  The watchdog also warned Moray - which has gone from reserves of \u0026pound18m to \u0026pound10m in three years - and North Ayrshire could run out of reserves in two or three years\u0026rsquo time.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos provisional outturn figures for 2017-18 and budget estimates for 2018-19 showed councils collectively spent \u0026pound126m of their general reserve last year.  This year it is expected to be \u0026pound113m, while in 2016-17 it was \u0026pound195m.  The budget for councils this year is around \u0026pound12bn, with reserves sitting at around \u0026pound1bn.  Although the headline figures in 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19 are offset by transfers in to reserves of around \u0026pound33m a year - half from oil-rich Shetland - the net drawd-owns of \u0026pound163m, \u0026pound93m and \u0026pound80m still represent percentage declines of 14, 8 and 7.5 per cent  The Scottish Tories said councils were being driven to \u0026ldquolast resort measures by SNP cuts, and claimed that on current trends all reserves would disappear within 14 years.  Tory MSP Alexander Stewart said: \u0026ldquoCouncils are increasingly dipping into their rainy day fund, and that\u0026rsquos a direct consequence of SNP budget cuts. It\u0026rsquos not like these reserves are being used for landmark projects, it\u0026rsquos a last resort to keep day-to-day services going.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not something that can continue \u0026ndash mathematically this option will disappear in little more than a decade if current trends continue. Under an SNP government, the financial wellbeing of Scotland\u0026rsquos 32 local authorities has deteriorated alarmingly.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos worse is that, while reserves are being used, services only appear to get worse.

The struggling department store chain will close 31 out of its 59 outlets through a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which will also allow it to secure rent reductions on its remaining shops.  Closures will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  House of Fraser secured the backing of more than 75% of creditors, including landlords, for the CVA at a meeting on Friday.  It was voted through despite anger among landlords, who have complained that they are being forced to stomach a financial hit at the same time as House of Fraser enjoys new investment.  Alongside the CVA, Hamleys owner C.banner is being lined up to buy a 51% stake in the firm and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  At the meeting, furious landlords berated House of Fraser\u0027s management and their advisers at KPMG over how the CVA was conducted.  They complained that their share of the vote had been structured unfairly in an attempt to push through the restructuring proposal.  Despite their protestations, a representative for two of House of Fraser\u0027s landlords said there had been \"no give\" from the top team.  House of Fraser boss Alex Williamson had warned that the store closures and job losses represented the \"last viable\" option to save the retailer, with the group at risk of collapse had the CVA been rejected.  Mr Williamson and chairman Frank Slevin were both in attendance at the creditor vote.  House of Fraser said the shops earmarked for closure, including its Oxford Street store, would remain open until early 2019.  The group also plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \"secure House of Fraser\u0027s future\".

Electricity supplied through the public street lighting network will not be charged for and the council will now perform technical assessments on the suitability of lighting columns and advise community groups after it had been initially proposed that applicants would have to perform these safety tests themselves.Applications for festive lighting installations can now be submitted by October 1.There will be restrictions on installations outwith main footfall areas, but an arrangement to allow the use of festive lights featuring the branding of commercial organisations will be extended by a year.ISC chair, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “The cost of electricity for festive lighting in Aberdeenshire is around £11,000 and that seems a small price to pay for the goodwill of communities making the effort to brighten themselves up and appear welcoming at Christmas – we recognise a lot of organisation and effort goes into this already. The excellent work communities do is clearly of benefit to the whole of Aberdeenshire and the cost is one we can bear.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"pupils enjoy kidsout event","story":"\t\tLocal youngsters enjoyed a fun day participating in a wide range of activities when they attended a Rotary KidsOut Aberdeen event held a SRUC Craibstone Campus recently.\t\t\t\tTwelve pupils and eight teachers from Ellon Primary School, along with two Ellon Rotarian helpers attended.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Friday 22 Jun 2018 5:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

You might even be able to buy your own one!The pupils had been working on the concept of improving cycling safety since January and came up with the idea of covering a bike in Led lights.The bike was coded using a BBC micro:bit and buttons were wired up to have functions such as working indicators, brake lights \u0026ndash which turn the whole bike red \u0026ndash and a speedometer, as well as customisable colours.Pupils taking part in Apps for Good explore all aspects of product development, from the initial idea and programming to product design and marketing.Mr Aitken says he hopes to build on the success of the Light Bike by setting up an Inventors\u0026rsquo Club in Wick High and possibly a CoderDojo \u0026ndash part of a network of computer programming clubs \u0026ndash for primary children.This week\u0026rsquos category win was the latest in a series of Apps for Good achievements by teams from Wick High.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been incredibly lucky to have seen success now at the Apps for Good Awards for six years running \u0026ndash an unbeaten record, Mr Aitken said.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen our ideas evolve from the creation of wireframe prototypes to full-blown apps and we\u0026rsquore now pushing the boundaries further with the introduction of Internet of Things, physical computing, and very soon we\u0026rsquoll be starting machine learning / artificial intelligence with our pupils.\u0026ldquoAs always, I\u0026rsquom excited for what the future may bring for Wick High School pupils.Friday 22 Jun 2018 5:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 22, 2018 at 11:30 amFour Orkney rugby players are gearing up for the opportunity of a lifetime, after being selected for the Penguins invitational team.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
