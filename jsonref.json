This is up from just 27 per cent eight years ago, Ofcom\u0027s research found.The devices have become so central to modern life that nearly a fifth (17 per cent) of adults and half of British teens now only ever access the internet on their phones. More than half of UK adults consider them to be their most important device for accessing the internet.         The surging popularity of social media, a rapid rise in smartphone ownership and the rollout of high-speed internet have contributed to Britons\u0027 heavy internet usage (stock photo)The average Briton looks at their phone every 12 minutes, and two out of every five adults checks their mobile within the first five minutes of waking up.Women spend longer on their phones than men, an average of 33 minutes more every day, the study showed.And Britons are willing to spend more money on apps that will help them in the pursuit of love and sex than anything else, Ofcom\u0027s study suggests.Two of the top three apps that internet users spent money on were for dating. Tinder topped the list, followed by TV and movie streaming service Netflix. The third was dating app Bumble, which only lets women make the first move.Smartphones and tablets are also driving heavy web usage among the young.

Seven out of ten adults in the UK have a social media account, and spend an average of 39 minutes a day poring over them, the study found.Facebook is by far the most popular platform, with 88 per cent of social media users having an account last year and spending an average of 23 minutes a day flicking through it.However, its popularity has fallen since 2016, when 95 per cent of social media users had an account.

Kathy Gyngell, co-editor of the Conservative Woman website, said: ‘This is an extraordinarily harsh revolution in the nurturing of children. Then we wonder why we are seeing increased mental health problems among young people.’According to the breakdown from the ONS, in the mid-1990s just under 62 per cent of women with dependent children – which means they are under 16 or under 18 if they are still at school or college – had a job. That figure rose to 70 per cent in the autumn of 2014. Yesterday’s assessment, covering January to March this year, showed 75.3 per cent of women with dependent children are in work.The numbers of stay-at-home married and partnered women are diminishing fast. Latest figures show there are 1.8 million women aged under 65 who do not choose to work – 255,000 in five years.The landmark for working mothers follows years of efforts by ministers of all major parties to persuade women to stay in jobs after they have children. The campaign has been backed by subsidies for childcare, flexible working rules, and a scheme which allows fathers to share parental leave with mothers.However, the concept of working mothers has remained controversial.Mrs Gyngell said: ‘Many children of full-time working mothers are in long hours of childcare, often in institutions, and there is evidence that this can harm both their emotional and cognitive development.’Broadcaster and former head of the Right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, Jill Kirby, said: ‘There is no support for families who want the option for a parent to stay at home to look after young children.‘Children are losing out on time with their parents.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Government faces calls relax migration rules list jobs Brits wont published","story":"Share this article Other occupations may suffer from nerdy reputations, particularly in the case of IT analysts, web designers and biochemists.Mechanical engineering jobs are particularly difficult to fill as they may involve shift work at night and weekends, the committee said.Professor Manning said: \u0027Today\u0027s labour market is very different to the one we reviewed when the last list was published in 2013.\u0027Unemployment is lower and employers in various industries are facing difficulties in finding skilled people to fill their vacancies.          Alp Mehmet, vice chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said if these recommendations were accepted, it would amount to a turning point in immigration policyThat is why we have recommended expanding the SOL to cover a range of occupations in health, information and engineering fields.\u0027We are recommending a full review of the SOL once there is a clearer picture of what the future immigration system will look like.\u0027The list applies only to workers from outside of the EU as, until Brexit, those from inside the EU enjoy free movement between member states without visas.Where jobs are on the list, foreign employees do not have to meet a minimum £35,800 salary requirement for permanent settlement after five years. They are also given priority if the annual cap of 20,700 highly skilled workers being allowed into the UK is met.Jane Gratton, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u0027Expanding the Shortage Occupation List will help businesses access the skills they need when they can\u0027t recruit locally.\u0027The ending of free movement will present significant costs and challenges for employers.\u0027But Alp Mehmet, vice chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: \u0027If these recommendations were accepted, it would amount to a turning point in immigration policy. The control of numbers would, in effect, be abandoned and the incentive for UK employers to train UK workers would be even further reduced.\u0027The Home Office said of the report: \u0027We will consider it carefully and respond in due course.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Now McDonalds joining vegan revolution","story":"Vegan demonstrators storm Nando\u0027s in protest at cruelty to...Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"Watchdog orders energy companies reduce price rises","story":"Share this article Action by Ofwat is said to have reduced bills £435million and it has made clear that water firms can expect lower price rises and returns from 2020. Ofgem has confirmed it will limit network company returns over five years starting in 2021.But Citizens Advice claims the measures do not provide redress for households – and is demanding refunds.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away.

It’s not a re-run of 2016.”When asked if it would not be a second “in-out” referendum, Mr Corbyn said: “It would be on the basis of whatever we have succeeded in negotiating.”Asked if he thought the situation was moving closer to no deal, he said: “The Tory party will have to speak for itself, but of the candidates that have nominated themselves so far, they appear to be of the view that there should be a no-deal Brexit. I’m absolutely opposed to that.”New commissionAsked how he could negotiate the agreement when the EU had repeatedly said the withdrawal agreement was not up for renegotiation, he said: “Well, we’ve just had the EU elections, there will obviously be a new commission and we’ll be discussing this with the Taoiseach tomorrow.“I do not want Britain to become some kind of tax haven on the shores of Europe. I want us to have a close relationship with Europe in the future. After all, jobs on both sides of the channel, and of course in Ireland as well, depend on that trading relationship.”Mr Corbyn is in Ireland for meetings with trade union leaders, as well as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Opposition leaders. He will also pay a visit to President Michael D Higgins.“We’re meeting the Taoiseach tomorrow to discuss our ideas about a customs union with the European Union, which we would put to the House of Commons as well as protections of all of the rights, the dynamic protection of all of the rights, that have been obtained through EU membership,” he said.“The Labour Party is of the position that we should be quite prepared to put this to a public vote subsequently.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has said the insurance industry is “profiteering” and demanded that it be “upfront and transparent” about significant premium increases seen by consumers.Mr Flanagan told The  he expects the industry to “play its part” in insurance reform, and called on it to “give certain guarantees” that costs to consumers will come down in the wake of proposed legislative reforms. The reforms are designed to help tackle the high cost of settlements, and the Minister said they will be introduced later this year.It is hoped the Judicial Council Bill, which is working its way through the Oireachtas, will help drive down the cost of payouts for soft tissue injuries, such as whiplash. Included in it is a provision to give a group of judges a remit to recalibrate guidelines for injury payouts in personal injury cases.Last September, the Personal Injuries Commission found that payouts for whiplash and other soft tissue injuries in the State were four or five times higher than in the UK.The industry has argued that these reforms will enable it to charge lower prices to Irish consumers.More informationThe Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, Michael D’Arcy, is expected to introduce amendments to a Sinn Féin Private Members’ Bill which would force insurers to disclose more information when premiums rise. The amendments would also reduce the amount an insurance company could hold in reserve until repair works, for example, on a damaged property, are complete. This practice is common in the industry.Mr Flanagan said the industry was too quick to blame high costs on exaggerated or fraudulent claims.“I accept there are fraudulent claims. My concern is that fraudulent claims are being put forward as a justification of high insurance costs, and I’m not sure that’s the case. There is fraud, it’ll be stamped out, but there’s more than fraud. There’s the high costs and the profiteering and a reluctance on the part of the insurance industry to be upfront and transparent.”In response, Insurance Ireland chief executive Kevin Thompson said: “The cost of our compensation awards, and the cost of settling them, are the defining issues in the market.”He criticised delays in bringing forward the “critically important” Judicial Council Bill. “We still do not know when personal injury compensation award levels will be recalibrated, and this is deeply concerning in the current climate,” he said.“Insurers in Ireland have a strong track record of responding to reforms of costs when implemented.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3908721.1559161145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new rules for oireachtas committees to follow kerins ruling","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAngela Kerins was the subject of an in-depth inquiry by the PAC in 2014 about the finances of Rehab, including her own remuneration. Photograph: Cyril ByrneNew rules about how TDs conduct inquiries in Oireachtas committees are to be drawn up following a Supreme Court ruling yesterday which found the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) had acted unlawfully in its treatment of the former chief executive of Rehab Angela Kerins. The Oireachtas confirmed that a working group set up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is to report in the autumn in the wake of the court’s ruling yesterday.It is expected the new rules, intended to offer some protection to witnesses before committees against unfair treatment and questioning by TDs, will be put in place after the next general election.Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said work had commenced to look at the way in which Oireachtas committees work and to look at the role of the chair of those committees in ensuring fairness. “There is a particular role for the chair to be fair to those in the committee and to intervene,” she said. “We are acutely aware that when someone is invited in front of the committee that we have to stay within the remit and I think some of those points were reiterated today. I think you will see a change in how the committee functions in relation to this.” She said a “structure” was likely to be considered to address complaints of a committee straying beyond its remit.Ms Kerins was the subject of an in-depth inquiry by the PAC in 2014 about the finances of Rehab, including her own remuneration. Some time after her appearances at the committee, which included lengthy and intense questioning, Ms Kerins became ill and was hospitalised. She later tried to take her own life, she said.Yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that the committee had acted unlawfully in its treatment of her. MechanismsHowever, the court – which had previously been reluctant to interfere in the work of the Oireachtas – stressed that TDs could themselves put in place mechanisms to protect witnesses in the event of a committee “acting inappropriately”, something which Oireachtas sources said was likely to be done. Ms Kerins’s case will now return to a three-judge High Court where any decision on whether or not she is entitled to damages will be made at a later hearing. Ms Kerins last night issued a statement through her solicitors in which she thanked people for their “kindness, compassion and support”.The current chair of the PAC, Fianna Fáil TD Seán Fleming, said it was “a matter for the Oireachtas to consider the judgment”.Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness, who was chairman of the committee at the time, declined to comment last night. Minister for Transport Shane Ross, who was also on the committee, said: “The Oireachtas has accepted the judgment and is already looking at any appropriate remedies.”Former Labour Party TD Robert Dowds, who was also a member of the committee at the time, said there needed to be a “careful examination” of what the role of the PAC should be. “At the same time I feel strongly that they should be able to examine the spending of public monies, whether it is by the State or charitable organisations,” he said.“It is important that parliamentarians have the right to stand up and say what needs to be said.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3908766.1559168051!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in seeks recount as greens are poised to take final european seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t New elected Fine Gael MEP Maria Walsh at the Castlebar count centre  with her father Vincent and mother Noreen on her election to the European Parliment. Photograph: Michael Mc LaughlinSinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada has sought a recount of votes in the Ireland South constituency as she faced losing her European Parliament seat on Wednesday night to the Green Party’s Grace O’Sullivan.Ms Ní Riada was placed at 98,379 votes on the 18th count, 327 votes behind the Green Party senator.The Sinn Féin MEP was due to be eliminated and her votes distributed but, following her request to the returning officer, a full recount will take place on Thursday morning at Nemo Rangers GAA club in Co Cork.Ms O’Sullivan said she understood the basis for the recount, noting “750,000 votes have been counted in the last few days. You can understand when it comes down to a full small hundred an error could be made.“At this point in time I am the holder of the fifth seat. The Brexit seat. The seat of uncertainty. I hope to hold it. In the end, the voters have voted. It is what it is and I am big and strong enough to keep going.”The distribution of Mr Kelleher’s surplus of 11,786 papers left Mr Wallace on 112,441 and Ms Clune on 101,012, both comfortably ahead of the Green Party and Sinn Féin challengers.The order in which the seats are filled is important as the fifth seat in the constituency only comes into play once the UK leaves the European Union. If Ms Ní Riada is eliminated following the recount her distribution will determine the finishing order.Mr Kelleher took the second seat having received a massive 38,767 transfers from his running mate, councillor Malcolm Byrne, in the 17th count.Flanked by party leader Micheál Martin, Mr Kelleher said he was “elated, honoured and humbled” as well as “exceptionally relieved”.“It is a wonderful feeling to be elected by friends, neighbours, people you know and people you don’t know across the constituency. It is a really humbling experience and an emotional one,” he said.Ms Clune was thrown a lifeline in the 16th count when she received a massive 20,183 votes from the distribution of her Fine Gael running mate Andrew Doyle’s and Labour’s Sheila Nunan’s papers. This represented over a quarter of the available transfers. Ms Clune received just 64,605 first preference votes in the first count on Monday.Sitting Fine Gael MEP and former GAA president Seán Kelly\u0026nbspwas the first to be elected in the constituency, describing his poll-topping performance as “probably the greatest moment of my political career”.Mr Kelly received 119,444 first preference votes but had to wait 24 hours to cross the finish line from the announcement of the first count results.Earlier, Independent MEP Luke Ming Flanagan, Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy and Fine Gael’s Maria Walsh took the last three European Parliament seats in Midlands North West ahead of Independent candidate Peter Casey.Fianna Fáil’s Brendan Smith was eliminated on the 12th count where he stood at 68,677 votes, 1,246 behind Mr Casey. On the previous count, the Green Party’s Saoirse McHugh was eliminated.Speaking after his election in Midlands North West, Mr Flanagan said he believed his previous stint in Brussels convinced the public of his credentials.He said\u0026nbspof his first two years in the European Parliament: “I have to admit I was a little bit at sea, I found it very frustrating but in the last three years I really grew to understand it and I am able to communicate that message through social media to be able to explain to people exactly what I’m doing.”Ms Walsh, the 2014 Rose of Tralee, said her victory was partly down to “the huge amount of ground we covered as a team” during the campaign.“I was fortunate that many of the towns and villages we visited over the last few weeks and months I had already visited as an international Rose. So you’re just reintroducing yourself as a political representative.”Mr Carthy dedicated his win to Sinn Féin party members and said he hoped some could take “solace” in his win after disappointing local elections. “Leonard Cohen once said there is a crack in everything before the light comes in,” the MEP remarked.On Tuesday, Independents4Change TD Clare Daly and Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews took the final two MEP seats in Dublin.

But by 2018, the number of plug in vehicles grew to 186,386 - with only 6669 charging points.Martyn Allen, technical director at Electrical Safety First, said the Government need to invest in adequate infrastructure in order to achieve their aim for all cars to zero emission by 2040.He said: “Our research shows a direct link between a lack of electric vehicle infrastructure and vehicle owners charging dangerously.“A modern Britain also needs to be a safe one and Electrical Safety First is urging the government and local authorities to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to support the rapid increase in numbers of electric vehicles on our roads.”The data, obtained from the Department for Transport, also revealed the UK’s “postcode lottery” when it comes to accessibility of charging points, the charity said.In London, there are 2.6 charging points per 10,000 residents, whilst in Wales there are 1.03.Please review our commenting policyComment: Only a pro-Brexit successor to pro-EU Theresa May can restore the Special Relationship to greatnessActing US secretary of defence contradicts Trump over North Korean missile testWorld\u0026#39s \u0026#39tiniest baby\u0026#39: Saybie leaves San Diego hospital after being born 23 weeks into pregnancyHungary tourist boat capsizes in Danube, leaving seven dead and 21 missingStress in pregnancy \u0026#39reduces the chance\u0026#39 of having grandchildrenPeople now spending 50 days a year online, major new Ofcom study findsUniversity tuition fees should be capped at £7,500 not £9,250, Government review saysEU citizens should get legal right to remain in UK after Brexit, say MPsTwo-thirds of knifepoint robberies are unsolved - as police seize 10,000 knives off the streets in a weekSausages and other ‘ultra-processed foods’ could increase the risk of early death by 60 per cent Investigation reveals doubling in NHS rationing of cataract surgery  Julian Assange moved to prison health ward as WikiLeaks reveal  \u0026#39grave concerns\u0026#39 about well-beingIsrael to hold unprecedented second election after Netanyahu fails to form a coalitionBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2019, live semi-final 3, recap: Heartstring-tugging pensioners and affable comedians are standout actsPhilip Hammond to rebuke Tory leadership candidates over \u0026#39reckless\u0026#39 promises of tax cutsComment: There can never be One Nation if liberal Conservatives betray BrexitBoris Johnson victim of \u0026#39plot to stop Brexit\u0026#39 as he faces criminal trial over Leave campaignMarcus Ball: How Boris Johnson\u0026#39s accuser over Brexit spent donations on self-defence classes and special cupcakesPrison officers threaten to withdraw labour over surging violence, as they call for pepper spray useRory Stewart admits smoking opium in Iran as he continues Tory leadership tour of Britain We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000198700716_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"gross violation uk must demand end indonesian militarys invasive","story":"Indonesia is struggling to increase the number of female recruits to its security forces Department for International DevelopmentThe UK government has been urged by human rights campaigners to make aid and increased trade with Indonesia conditional on an end to degrading “virginity tests”.For decades, women applying to Indonesia’s military have been subjected to the invasive practice in the belief that it will establish whether they are sexually active – and therefore if they are “moral” and “worthy of office”. The “two finger test”, in which medics check whether a woman’s hymen is still intact, has no basis in science and is used as a humiliating threat to keep women from progressing in the country\u0027s security apparatus. The issue is being raised as the UK Department for International Development (Dfid) and the Department of Trade move to expand relations with the fast growing south east Asian state.Dr Meghan Campbell, deputy director of the Oxford Human Rights Hub and law lecturer at Birmingham University, told The  that the UK should “strenuously advocate” for an end to the practice.“Virginity testing is a gross violation of a woman’s right to equality,” she said. “It reinforces stereotypes that a woman’s moral worth is exclusively connected to sexual activity… and excludes them from positions of power.“As the UK seeks to position itself as a global leader it should protect the human rights of women all over the world,” Dr Campbell added.Police officers react to riots in Jakarta. Almost 95 per cent of Indonesia\u0026#39s police and military is made up of men“In interactions with the Indonesian government, be it trade, the Department for International Development or any other context, the UK should strenuously advocate for the removal of the test. It can put conditionalities on aid and trade that should require the removal of virginity testing,” she said. Just last week, Indonesia deployed thousands of police and military officers to the streets of the capital, Jakarta, to quell violent protests over disputed presidential election results. The absence of female officers was stark. Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), who has researched the issue for decades, claimed the practice was impacting the military’s performance at home and abroad.Last June, Indonesia was selected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and has since faced calls to improve its poor record on female participation in peacekeeping missions.But last week the Indonesian defence ministry continued to defend the continued use of “virginity tests” when recruiting female officers as a question of “character”.Iroth Sonny Edhie, a chief aide and head of protocol for the Indonesian defence minister, told The  that virginity tests were a central aspect of recruitment.  Firecrackers explode amid violent riots following the Indonesian presidential elections“Basically this value has been preserved since our armed forces was established around 70 years ago.”But pressure has been mounting internationally to abandon virginity tests, with the World Health Organisation and the United Nations calling for a total ban to the practice last October.The agencies said that although the tests are prevalent in at least 20 countries around the globe, including Afghanistan, Egypt and Iraq, there is “no evidence” that “the female genitalia can indicate a girl’s or woman’s history of sexual activity.”Fears are growing about the influence of conservative Islam on the largely moderate society of Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation.HRW first exposed the use of virginity tests by security forces in 2014. Little has changed since – the army, navy and air force still openly subject women to the invasive practice.The tests, which affect women joining the military and formerly police, have no basis in scienceMr Harsono told The  that groups of three to five women go into a hospital room together and are subjected to the test in quick succession. The medic, often a man, inserts two fingers into a woman’s vagina to see if the hymen is intact. “It\u0027s not about the pain, but the trauma of being exposed,” he said. “Most doctors are male, and women are asked to lie down with their legs open. It\u0027s the associated trauma – having to undress completely in front of others, that stays with the women.”“This is unscientific, this is irrational, this is discriminatory against women, this is degrading,” Mr Harsono added.Academic, physical and personality assessments are all part of the military application process. While some reports suggest there are often no repercussions of “failing” the virginity test, it is one of a series of personality assessments used to determine if a woman is “good enough.”“The skill to shoot, the skill to defend your country, is nothing to do with your virginity,” Eva Sundari, an MP in Indonesia’s parliament since 2004, told The .Indonesia post-election protests leave six dead in JakartaThe Indonesian police appear to have recognised there is a problem. “Since 2014, we didn’t do it for a requirement of the police test. To be a policewoman does not depend on virginity,” said Brigadier General Dedi Praseyto, the national police spokesman.However, Mr Harsono alleged that while the practice had ended in the capital Jakarta, it was still taking place in provinces that were “very difficult to control.”The small percentage of female police officers is a challenge in a country which struggles to tackle sexual violence – in 2013 more rapes were reported among Sweden’s 10 million citizens than in Indonesia, which has a population of 250 million, suggesting that many survivors fear reporting the crime.“Women often do not want to report these crimes against them to male officers.”Mrs Budi claimed the police continued virginity tests under the guise of a “reproductive health check.”“The police say that they have stopped virginity tests, but I’m not so sure. The police now say that women need to have a reproductive health check… but I have been told this test still includes a virginity test.”Studies have shown that women can help to calm violent situationsShe added: “I feel sad and disappointed about the practice, yes, because of the assumption that a woman has to be a virgin to be a good woman. This leads to unfair judgments of women.”Sri Rumiati, a retired officer, has been campaigning for an end to the tests in the police force since she realised in 2006 that they only applied to women. When she joined the Indonesian National Police in 1985, she did not question the practice.“At the beginning of undergoing a virginity test, of course it was not comfortable for me, because I had to open the private domain before a doctor,” she told The . “Sad, upset but unable to do anything because this is part of the selection, I just lived with it.”She now maintains that the tests are against Indonesian anti-discimination laws, but has faced opposition from male colleagues.“Many were angry when I questioned the requirements for virginity checks, especially from the health ision that made these requirements,” she said. “There were some people who said I was crazy.”  Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHowever, not everyone who has been subjected to the test is against it. Many female officers see it as a rite of passage, as a test which helps to maintain a quality police force.“Virginity testing is part of the reason that we don’t have many female police officers,” Anindya Restuviani, co-director of campaign group Hollaback! Jakarta, told The .“But it’s complicated, lots of women who are in the police or army think that virginity tests are good. And there’s a mindset that they are superior because they passed the test,” she said.“Virginity testing is just another form of the discrimination women face every day,” she added. “There are many, many reasons it happens but the main problem is the patriarchal culture. Women are perceived as second class citizens, they’re not seen as having the same value as men.”A spokesperson from UK\u0027s Foreign and Commonwealth Office told The :  “The UK is committed to defending human rights.

Soon, Amazon will allow people to ask Alexa, delete what I just said, too.The feature could be a response to increasing concern about what Amazon is doing with the recordings that it takes of people who own its Alexa devices. The company says it collects them to improve the performance of its voice assistant, but reports have drawn attention to the ways that some people could listen in to them.Amazon has always offered the ability to listen to and delete voice recordings, but it requires digging through the device\u0027s settings.The company is also launching an Alexa Privacy Hub which will allow people to learn about Amazon\u0027s approach to privacy and how to change the settings that dictate what information Alexa is collecting.The new feature was revealed alongside the Echo Show 5, Amazon\u0027s new Alexa device which like its predecessors contains a screen.It also has a privacy focus of its own. For the first time, Amazon has added a camera shutter, allowing people to manually cover up the lens inside the Alexa box to stop it taking video recordings.How to listen to and delete Alexa\u0027s recordingsThe new version is smaller and comes at a relatively cheap price of only £79.99. The existing, larger Echo Show costs £219.99.“Since we launched the first Echo Show device, customers have told us that they love asking Alexa to show them things—whether it’s asking for their favourite recipes to cook along with, their shopping list, or music lyrics. With Echo Show 5, we’ve made it even easier and affordable for customers to add a smart display to every room of their house,” said Jorrit Van der Meulen, VP Amazon Devices EU.“The compact form factor is perfect for a bedside table or desk, plus it has a camera shutter for added peace of mind, and new Alexa privacy features that are coming soon to the UK for even more control.”\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Administrative jobs, support services, and retail saw the largest fall in the numbers of workers on low pay.A record two\u0026nbspmillion workers - 7.3 per cent of the population - now receive the legal minimum wage.Despite warnings from business groups, a significant ramping up of the minimum wage level has taken place without any significant negative impacts on jobs, the Resolution Foundation said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Red Arrows in the Apollo formation while performing a full display at Chalkoutsi, Greece.

Women and young people have been the main beneficiaries of a higher minimum wage, whose ratcheting up has not stopped employment rising to a record high.“It’s great that both main parties want to go even further on raising the minimum wage and eliminate low pay altogether. But such an ambitious move would transform the labour market, and must therefore be approached boldly but cautiously.“An ambitious but cautious approach that saw the National Living Wage continue to rise after 2020 – at a faster pace than the minimum wage has increased over its 20 year history ¬– would put Britain on course to eliminate low pay in the middle of the 2020s, while still giving the government room for manoeuvre if economic conditions change.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new parking data standards will bring government, private organisations and technologies together to ensure a smoother parking experience for drivers.The standards could also help drivers avoid parking tickets which can cost up to £100 each.Some 6.81 million penalty charges were handed to British drivers by parking management firms in 201819, according to RAC Foundation analysis.Parking companies obtain records from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to chase car owners for alleged infringements in private car parks such as at shopping centres, leisure facilities and motorway service areas.AA president Edmund King said: It has been estimated that the average motorist spends up to four days per year just looking for a parking space which causes congestion, increased emissions and sometimes road rage.Improving smart and shared data on parking availability would be welcome relief to the millions of drivers just going round in circles searching for the holy grail of a parking spot.Additional reporting by Press AssociationDepartment for TransportBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21.

Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.He added that the character’s sillier side was inspired by a comedic turn in Paul Feig’s all-female Ghostbusters reboot.Speaking about the film’s backlash from male fans of the 1984 original, Hemsworth said: “That whole period I was like, ‘What ownership do you guys have over those characters? Oh, you watched the film, therefore you should have a say over where it goes?’ I thought it was very unfortunate and kind of disappointing.”The actor will next be seen in Men In Black International, which he stars in alongside his Avengers co-star Tessa Thompson. it’ll be released in cinemas on 14 June.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Women and young people have been the main beneficiaries of a higher minimum wage, whose ratcheting up has not stopped employment rising to a record high.“It’s great that both main parties want to go even further on raising the minimum wage and eliminate low pay altogether. But such an ambitious move would transform the labour market, and must therefore be approached boldly but cautiously.“An ambitious but cautious approach that saw the National Living Wage continue to rise after 2020 – at a faster pace than the minimum wage has increased over its 20 year history ¬– would put Britain on course to eliminate low pay in the middle of the 2020s, while still giving the government room for manoeuvre if economic conditions change.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is not known exactly how this process occurred, but a research team from Kyoto University in Japan has revealed the first ever evidence of wild chimps habitually catching and consuming freshwater crabs.The findings may provide scientists with new insight into the behaviours which drove our own progress, the scientists suggest.Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, the team describes year-round, freshwater crab-fishing behaviour – primarily among female and infant chimpanzees – living in the rainforest of the Nimba Mountains in Guinea, west Africa.“The aquatic fauna our ancestors consumed likely provided essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, required for optimal brain growth and function,” said lead author Kathelijne Koops from the University of Zurich and Kyoto University’s leading graduate programme in primatology and wildlife science.Created with Sketch.

For two years, they documented the demographics and behaviour of the group of chimps, while also analysing and comparing the nutritional value of the crabs to other foods in the chimpanzees’ diet.Crabbing, they learned, not only took place year-round – without regard to season or fruit availability – but intriguingly was negatively correlated with the chimps’ consumption of ants, another diet staple. Mature males were the least likely to consume aquatic fauna.“Energy and sodium levels in large crabs are comparative with ants,” Dr Koops said, “leading us to hypothesise that crabs may be an important year-round source of protein and salts for females – especially when pregnant or nursing – and for growing juveniles.”The study sheds light on our own evolution by illustrating that fishing behaviours may not be restricted by habitat as could be assumed.Chimpanzees filmed eating tortoises after smashing their shells openMystery ‘ghost species’ of chimpanzee discovered in bonobo DNAChimpanzees have much cleaner beds than humans do, scientists findChimpanzees learn to play rock, paper, scissors “This isn’t the first case of non-human primates eating crabs,” said senior co-author Tetsuro Matsuzawa, “but it is the first evidence of apes other than humans doing so.”He said notable previous observations of primates eating crabs came from “monkey species in locations consistent with aquatic faunivory – lakes, rivers, or coastlines – and not in closed rainforest.”He added: “It’s exciting to see a behaviour like this that allows us to improve our understanding of what drove our ancestors to ersify their diet.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Cars, on the other hand, run on money and make you fat.But for many of those not already converted to the two-wheels-good, four-wheels-bad brigade, the well-publicised benefits of cycling\u0026nbsp– for your health and your bank balance, as well as the planet – are outweighed by the inherent risks of taking to two wheels in the UK’s traffic-clogged towns and cities.The Dutch learnt how to build proper cycling infrastructure in the 1970s after a spate of road deaths, but the UK is still struggling to prove it takes the issue of safe cycling seriously.\u0026nbspSurvey after survey shows feeling unsafe on the roads is a major deterrent for new cyclists. One recent poll found almost half of respondents would be encouraged to use their bicycle if they weren’t forced to share the road quite so intimately with cars and lorries.A visit to the continent shows how quickly and easily other countries seem to have found building properly segregated bike lanes – surely screwing rubber “armadillo” humps or plastic bollards into the road is much cheaper and quicker than the full blown road redesigns Transport for London and other local authorities seem to favour.Better transport planning would allow more kids to cycle to schoolNow, a study suggests the benefits of high-quality bike infrastructure actually go far further than just protecting the cyclist. Fatalities among all road users fall dramatically when high-quality infrastructure is built, slowing traffic and forcing everyone on the roads to take greater care.Even motoring association the AA backs the research with its conclusion\u0026nbspthat more bike lanes are needed. There is certainly an argument to be made that cyclists must also\u0026nbspplay a role in ensuring our shared public spaces are both safe and pleasant to use.The high-profile death of a pedestrian hit by a cyclist with no brakes in east London, coupled with anecdotal evidence of red-light runners and pavement cyclists, can contribute to a sense that those on two wheels don’t abide the rules. And while that group are in the minority, their behaviour plays into the hands of those who would sooner see bike lanes returned to their former use than have more genuinely safe infrastructure for everyone to use.But the progress (albeit limited) that has been made – particularly in the capital, but in other large cities such as Manchester\u0026nbsp– is under threat. Powerful lobbyists are putting pressure on decision-makers to rip up London’s flagship east-west cycle lane. Opponents of the hugely popular route, which provides space for a safe commute for thousands each day, have included the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey.Campaigns on social media juxtapose\u0026nbspimages of an empty bike lane hugging the Thames with lines of motor traffic disappearing into the distance as evidence that we need more, not fewer, lanes for cars and vans. So far, thankfully, those in charge of transport planning have not budged.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is understood that there is no plan to replace Ms Weyand, who was deputy chief negotiator and who has an intimate working knowledge of the negotiations.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday evening,\u0026nbspJean-Claude Juncker said he was “crystal clear” that there would be no more renegotiation, reiterating a commission line that he has held since October last year –\u0026nbspbut apparently fallen on deaf ears in Westminster.Tory leadership candidates told there will be no Brexit renegotiationBut despite the unambiguous message emanating from Brussels, most Tory leadership candidates are still standing on platforms of reopening negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, which MPs rejected three times. An attempt by Ms May to bring the deal back for a fourth vote in the House of Commons set in motion a chain of events that resulted in her announcing he resignation – precipitating the current leadership contest.The move of Ms Weyand to be the boss of the Directorate General for Trade\u0026nbspmeans that were the UK to accept the withdrawal agreement, it would also face her in negotiating its future trade deal with the EU – the next phase of talks. She will also oversee the negotiation of trade deals with the rest of the world in the post because it\u0026nbspis not Brexit-specific.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentMr Barnier tweeted: “Congrats to Sabine Weyand on her appointment as new Director-General of Trade!

Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour’s preference is still a\u0026nbspgeneral election but Mr Corbyn has softened his tone towards a Final Say vote since the European elections, telling MPs\u0026nbspthat the party was “ready to support a public vote on any\u0026nbspdeal”, rather than only to stop a Tory Brexit.Speaking ahead of his trip to Ireland, Mr Corbyn emphasises the shift, saying: “Labour will work with anyone across party boundaries and do whatever is necessary to stop a disastrous no deal outcome, which would open the way for a frenzy of deregulation and a race to the bottom in jobs, rights and protections.“But faced with the threat of no deal and a prime minister with no mandate, the only way out of the Brexit crisis ripping our country apart is now to go back to the people.“Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament.”Mr Corbyn said the upcoming Tory leadership contest – and the prospect of a “no-deal zealot”\u0026nbspbecoming prime minister – meant the issue must go back to the people.Tom Watson condemns ‘spiteful’ decision to expel Alastair CampbellIt is understood that party position has not changed to offer full backing for a Final Say vote, however Mr Corbyn’s language may give hope to supporters within Labour ranks.Meanwhile, Mr Watson stepped up his efforts to change party policy by publishing his own\u0026nbspsurvey, which found an overwhelming majority of members and supporters\u0026nbspwant an online ballot to decide Labour’s Brexit position.More than 84 per cent\u0026nbspof more than\u0026nbsp8,800 respondents said they would prefer an all-member poll, while\u0026nbsp13 per cent favoured a special conference and only 3 per cent backed an annual conference this autumn.“As deputy leader I’ll support them to make this happen.”Labour MP Bridget Phillipson, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said Mr Corbyn’s comments show he was “at last beginning to listen to what our voters and members are saying”.She said there was “no immediate prospect of a general election” so Labour should campaign explicitly for a public vote.It comes after isions within the party were further exposed by the decision to expel Alastair Campbell, a former spin doctor\u0026nbspfor Tory Blair,\u0026nbspfor voting for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ve always argued that it’s perfectly possible that Leave would win again, but we’re supporting a people’s vote strongly now because it’s the right thing to do and it’s the democratic thing to do.”Pressure on the Labour leadership ratcheted up several notches after\u0026nbspthe party lost supporters to the Liberal Democrats and Green Party in the EU elections, leaving Labour with just 14 per cent of the vote.Hours after the results were announced, Ms Abbott tweeted: “We have to take the time to analyse the EU vote. But, when we come in third after the Brexit Party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.”Created with Sketch.

She said that\u0026nbspsecuring a general election remained the party’s priority but added: “As the clock\u0026nbsptickets down, if we’re not going to have a general election, we would support a people’s vote.”Jeremy Corbyn has promised a consultation on Labour’s Brexit\u0026nbsppolicy that could end at the party’s annual conference in September, but his close ally Ms Abbott\u0026nbspinsisted he needed to “move quickly”. She said she would personally back Remain in any second referendum.Former prime minister Tony\u0026nbspBlair\u0026nbspsaid he had voted Labour “without great enthusiasm” as he pushed for the party to throw its weight behind a referendum.He said Mr Corbyn “has got to come to a clear position”, telling\u0026nbspSky News: “The one that is very obvious is that both party leaderships have made the same mistake, which is to think that it’s possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides.“What the European elections show you is that isn’t possible.”As Labour isions on Brexit resurfaced in the aftermath of the elections, MPs\u0026nbspin Leave-supporting areas warned against another referendum.Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said it would most likely result in a no-deal outcome.Labour leadership backs ‘public vote’ on BrexitConservatives and Labour hit hard in EU election routLabour should promise referendum after ‘kicking’ say Corbyn alliesLabour must back second referendum or face election loss, Watson warnsShe said: “Obviously in constituencies like Wigan you get very mixed views, you get different views like everywhere in the country, but to most people the idea of a second referendum just seems quite absurd.“People were asked what they think, you can see from the results that we had here, that very few people have changed their minds and if there is a shift in this area of the country I think it’s towards no-deal Brexit.”Ms Nandy added: “I think we’ve got to wake up to the seriousness, not just of what we’re about to do to the Labour Party, but what we’re about to do the country because I strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.”She went on: “There is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave, in towns like mine, to see leading figures from the Labour Party out calling for a second referendum before there’s been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dunstanburgh Castle is a 14th-century fortification on the coast of Northumberland in northern England, between the villages of Craster and Embleton.

In statements regarding the department’s “advance commitment to jobs, economic growth, clean energy,” Mark W. Menezes, the US under secretary of energy, and Steven Winberg, the assistant secretary for fossil energy introduced the new vocabulary. “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a erse and affordable source of clean energy, Mr Menezes said in the statement. “Further, more exports of U.S. LNG to the world means more US jobs and more domestic economic growth and cleaner air here at home and around the globe.”Meanwhile, Mr\u0026nbspWinberg’s\u0026nbspstatement read: “With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US\u0026nbspfreedom to be exported to the world.”Created with Sketch.Most shocking remarks made by Trump at campaign rallies Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.17 Doctors and mothers killing babiesAt a rally in Wisconsin in April 2019, Mr Trump made this extraordinary claim. “The baby is born, the mother meets with the doctor, they take care of the baby,” Mr Trump said. “They wrap the baby beautifully and then the doctor and the mother decide whether they will execute the baby”27 China rapes our countryAt a rally in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 2016, Mr Trump said this in reference to the US trade deficit with China: we can’t continue to allow China to rape our country and that’s what they’re doing.

One person was killed and dozens were injured.The storms were among 53 twisters that forecasters said touched down on Monday across eight states stretching eastward from Idaho and Colorado.Jeffrey Hazel, the mayor of Celina, near Dayton, said 81-year-old\u0026nbspMelvin Delhanna died during the tornado “as a direct result of a vehicle entering his house”.In Mercer County, where Celina is located, emergency management director Mike Robbins said that 12 people were injured in the storm.\u0026nbspMr Hazel said three of those injuries are considered to be serious but none are life-threatening.The National Weather Service (NWS)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspsaid on Tuesday morning that roughly five million people throughout the state had been affected by the power outages.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center showed that 14 suspected tornadoes touched down in Indiana, 11 in Colorado and nine in Ohio.Dayton, the fifth-largest city in Ohio with 140,000 residents, was particularly affected. Nearly 60,000 residents were without power after the storm.

Utilities are expecting restoration to take several days.National Weather Service issues highest tornado warnings in two yearsFor now, Dayton city officials have asked residents to conserve water, as power was lost in the city’s water plants and pump stations.Montgomery County, where Dayton is\u0026nbsplocated, Miami County, and Greene County were the most affected by the tornadoes, which authorities described as large and dangerous.\u0026nbspThe National Guard has been deployed in the aftermath.Tornadoes also touched down in nearby Trotwood, where the mayor told residents that power lines and trees were down. Ohio’s tornado spree marks the latest in a particularly harsh year for tornadoes in the US, which have caused major damage and several deaths in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, and several other states.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will win, we will win and the public will win,” he added.\u0026nbspMr Lieberman said earlier his refusal to cooperate was a matter of principle and not a “vendetta… to bring down the prime minister”.He blamed the Likud\u0026nbspfor the parliament’s collapse saying the party\u0026nbsp“failed completely to form a coalition”.“This is a surrender to the ultra-Orthodox parties … We never reached summation on any topic,” he added.The ultra-Orthodox parties consider conscription a taboo, fearing that military service will lead to immersion in secularism, and insist the exemptions should stay in place.\u0026nbspNetanyahu prepares for second election as coalition hopes fadeA do-or-die attempt to forge a coalition with the centre-left Labour Party, who have six seats in parliament,\u0026nbspalso failed.And so, with the deadline looming and little hope of an eleventh-hour break in the impasse, Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party and other supporters sought fresh elections.\u0026nbspFor Mr Netanyahu and his allies, a new election was\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsplast-ditch attempt to ward against President Reuven Rivlin tasking an alternative lawmaker, such as Mr Netanyahu’s chief rival Benny Gantz,\u0026nbspwith forming a government, which the president is obliged to do if the initial candidate fails.\u0026nbspOpposition MKs including the head of the leftist Meretz party, who hoped Mr Rivlin might choose another leader to forge a coalition, had initially planned to filibuster the parliamentary session until the deadline past\u0026nbspin order to prevent the vote on fresh elections from taking place.Critics say Mr Netanyahu is under mounting pressure to stay in power to counter the threat of indictment on corruption charges. He is due to face pre-trial hearing in October during which Israel’s attorney general Avichai Mandelblit will issue a final decision whether to send him to trial in three cases.Netanyahu’s wife gets plea bargain in meals fraud caseNetanyahu rejects plea from ex-officials not to annex West BankNetanyahu pushes through law to give him immunity from prosecutionNetanyahu says Israel will name Golan Heights community after TrumpIsrael’s opposition concedes election defeat to NetanyahuIn the last few months the embattled leader has tried to push through several immunity laws that would shield him from prosecution.In early May\u0026nbspthe Israeli media reported that the prime minister had been trying to advance a new bill that would “override” the Supreme Court’s authority to challenge a decision by the parliament to grant immunity, sparking uproar.Mr Netanyahu had apparently already tried to restore the 2005 wording of an immunity law, where the Knesset House Committee could reject the attorney general’s request to rescind immunity of a particular parliamentarian.If he is no longer prime minister governing a ruling coalition, it would be much harder to push any such legislation through parliament.Cross-party protests were held at the weekend in Tel Aviv against the attempted bills which critics said would cripple the top court and impact the power of the judiciary.Figures close to Mr Netanyahu told The Independent his decision to push ahead with the immunity laws\u0026nbspwas “inadvisable” and it made him far weaker, amid the stinging\u0026nbspbacklash.Netanyahu from standing trial, in Tel Aviv (Reuters Ammar Awad)Analysts said\u0026nbspfresh elections would cost the country significant funds and in the absence of a government, extend the political limbo until the end of the year during a tricky summer when\u0026nbspthe US had hoped to push ahead with some kind of peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.“It is going to cost money it is going to be problematic, but we don’t have any other way,”\u0026nbsp Professor Abraham Diskin, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Netanyahu really believes his position would improve after the elections, whether he is right or not we will see,” he added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heres what you need to know...The  Committee — formally known as the Conservative Private Members Committee — assembles weekly when Parliament is in session.It gives backbench Tory MPs the chance to air their concerns, report on constituency work and co-ordinate legislative agendas.And all this is done without fear of reprisal from Cabinet ministersbecause they are not permitted to be formal members.Only since  have frontbenchers been given an open invitation to attend meetings.They are still under the control of the party whips, so their ability to stoke insurrection is partly limited.But it is the Committee that assesses, organises and ballots on leadership challenges — meaning its power, when called upon, can be huge.Graham Brady received enough votes for a vote of no confidence, and made the announcement on December  that the vote would take place between pm-pm.The move ultimately failed, with May winning a majority of , with  Conservative MPs voting for her to remain, and  voting against her.She cannot be challenged through the same mechanism now for a year, although critics said winning only  per cent of the vote left her without a strong mandate.The Committee has an -member executive that organises weekly meetings and other business.They earned the nickname men in suits or men in grey suits in the s after prompting the resignation of Margaret Thatcher.The chairman, currently Altrincham and Sale West MP Graham Brady, is in charge of overseeing leadership challenges.Unless the leader steps down voluntarily, a leadership challenge usually begins with a vote of no confidence being called.This is triggered when  per cent of Tory MPs write a letter to the  Committee chairman.Currently it would take  letters to be submitted to trigger a vote and Graham Brady announced this minority had been reached on December .The last time this happened was in  when  MPs wrote to spark a vote on then leader Iain Duncan Smith, who was ousted a day later.There was speculation that Theresa May would face a leadership challenge or resign following her calamitous speech at the  Conservative party conference.Grant Shapps, a former chairman of the party, demanded the PM call a leadership election.And in January , a senior backbencher told The Sun that Brady was “ashen faced” at the prospect of getting one more letter – which he has said could spark a bitter leadership election and plunge Brexit talks into chaos.On October  it was revealed that James Duddridge, the MP for Rochford and Southend East, had submitted a letter of no confidence minutes before Theresa Mays conference speech.On Thursday November , leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg submitted a letter of no confidence in Theresa May over her draft Brexit deal.The senior Conservative backbencher, chairman of the European Research Group, had asked the Prime Minister in the Commons to give him a reason why he should not do so, given the broken promises he said the draft agreement contained. The  Committee was actually founded in .But its name comes from a famous meeting the previous year in which Conservative MPs called for the party to pull out of the coalition with the Liberals, led by PM David Lloyd George.This move triggered a General Election which the Tories then won.The committee first started out as a private dining club but quickly expanded and by  all Conservative backbench MPs were permitted to be members. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s time for a new generation to lead the charge into our future with boldness and vision.We must strengthen our Union, and the people we serve need a new social contract. A good job, a secure home and a brilliant school are the nuts and bolts of a happy le.As Housing Minister, it’s been my mission to build more high-quality homes as fast as we can, and numbers are looking good but there is much more work to do. We must pledge to offer these essentials to everyone: Job, House, School.I’ve run my own company for more than two decades, and weathered some really tough times, so I understand the opportunities and challenges small businesses face.We must revolutionise our economy, freeing a new generation of entrepreneurs to take risks and build businesses, creating jobs and wealth.And crucially we must spread that wealth with radical policies that make it easier for employees to own a stake in the business they work for, and to own shares generally. Everyone should have a piece of the national balance sheet.The Conservative Party must become the party of children, with their welfare, protection and future at the heart of everything we do.All of us have only one chance at childhood. It’s the foundation of our hopes, aspirations and character. There must be an all-out assault on child poverty, and we need to make the lives of parents easier.I’ve had political responsibility for a challenging social services department and London’s police force.Four years focused on a terrying surge in youth violence – and getting it under control – confirmed my view that education is the only social policy that consistently works.It is an escape route from a dead end, and the bedrock of social mobility. It’s also the reason I, and millions like me, got where we are.As Prime Minister I would make ours the party of well-funded schools, investing in the future of each and every child.That means investing heavily in science to tackle climate change and disease.As the chair of London Hydrogen, I promoted the green, British hydrogen fuel cell, and I founded the le sciences hub MedCity. I’ve led the debate on science in Parliament, and green tech would be central to my mission.We won’t get the chance to take on these and other pressing challenges unless we first work together to get Brexit completed.These steps - unity, a viable Brexit plan and a compelling domestic agenda - will secure a bright future for our remarkable country.I got into politics to get things done. As Deputy Mayor for Policing in the capital I drove action to cut teen killings by % and devised our first ever violence against women and girls strategy.I would bring this experience of fighting crime to being Prime Minister. As a councillor I led the effort that halved rough sleepers in central London, and now I’m building houses for the young.I’m a Northern boy who built a business in the Midlands and now represents a stunning part of Hampshire.My granddad was a Yorkshire wagon driver, my grandma a teacher, and my Mum and Dad were the first in their families to go to university.My family’s story is one of education, hard work and opportunity, and that’s what I want for everyone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Sunday it took several minutes to establish whether or not one of them, Wheeler Dealer, could impersonate an animal.When it does get going the show can very occasionally feel like arriving two hours late at the pub. Everyone’s laughing but you’ve no idea why.For the most part, though, The Ranganation belongs to the same comedy applause school as The Last Leg, Mash Report and New World Order.They’ll clap anything here, in fact. Romesh’s mum admits taking a curry to the cinema . Nigel Farage gets covered in milkshake . The Dogfather telling us to: “Stop raping the planet,” .Although, I say anything, the moment it broke down was when half a dozen people applauded the idea of Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister and, woah!, Romesh had to threaten them, jokingly, with ejection.They’d broken the rules, you see. Shows like The Ranganation like to think of themselves as edgy, but they’re very tightly governed by the laws of political correctness.This means you no longer have to be funny to be a stand-up or comedy host, but you must be on-message, which is why, paradoxically, we’ve never had more comedians on telly but so few actual laughs.Flogging them to death doesn’t work either. You may have found Katherine Ryan and Romesh funny the first time you saw them, but you’re probably fed up with the sight of them by their thousandth appearance.As for the actual process of this show The Ranganation wasn’t sure dating apps worked and milkshake throwing was also a grey area, but the host definitely thought we could save the planet by not flushing our toilets.“So do you mindI come round your house and p*** like a horse ”It’d be appreciated, ta.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I am not morbidly obese.”Good Morning Britain, Kevin Maguire: “There are quite a few Leave voters at the BBC.”And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “Honestly,Andi Peters was in  Hunks, which he should be, he’d be scoring .” Out of what, Susanna OVER on BBC’s look-into-the-future drama Years And Years, all-out nuclear war between China and America seems to have fizzled out after one episode.The good news, though, is it seems to have released enough radiation poisoning to kill off Jessica Hynes’s character, Edith, the campaigner, activist and all-round pain-in-the-ar*e, within the next couple of episodes.If you think that’ll be the end of the political lecture, however, you couldn’t be more wrong.Writer Russell T Davies is far too hot under the collar about America, Israel, “the West”, bankers, privatisation and “NHS cuts” to get off his high horse any time soon.Weirdly, he also wants Years And Years viewers to try and believe that, in the not-too-distant future, a Christian regime, in the Ukraine, will be torturing gay people.Which, given that homosexuality is currently and exclusively a death penalty offence in ten Islamic states, has to be one of the most cowardly distortions of reality I’ve ever seen on a television drama.Far less sinister, but almost as tiresome, is the continued presence of Alexander Armstrong on Years And Years.He turned up hosting a  edition of Have I Got News For You in the first episode, and then reappeared fronting Pointless Celebrities, in the year , last week.So don’t expect any sympathyhe reappears tonight on Best Ever Christmas , still murdering Fields Of bloody Gold.You’ve been given your four-minute warning.Michael Owen: “It was great opportunityism from the striker.”And Neil Lennon: “It’s a once-in-a-letime opportunity that’s come round again.”Victoria Coren Mitchell’s nauseating love-in with MP Jess Phillips on Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan telling Le Stories guest Mel B The Spice Girls were “the female Beatles”, when they weren’t even the female Tremeloes.Hollyoaks actor Maxim Baldry attempting a Ukrainian accent in Years And Years.Every bone-idle chancer in Britain interpreting “Bank Holiday Monday” as “Take Friday off as well”.And Britain’s Got Talent auditions getting lost in sob stories, sentimentality and all those magical charisma voids who begin by announcing: “I need someone to come up and help me.” BZZZZZ, “Next ”B “Form a conga with Seumas Milne and start celebrating.”C “We don’t know.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  Serbian Branislav Ivanovic joined which London-based football team ”I’d have had these people housed in the sort of lodges we give away on this programme.”But you weren’t, so stop playing the hero and just link to your rip-off phone-line competition. Picture research by Alfie Snelling.NEVER a good sign, is it, when you vomit up your own decomposed internal organs, have to be buried in a zinc coffin and a cement mixer turns up to your funeral That’s the thing about Sky Atlantic’s Chernobyl, though, it spares you no details about the greatest technological catastrophe of the th century.

Tory MEPs were almost wiped out.It was expected, but that cannot hide the seriousness of the Conservatives’ crisis. Not only did most voters abandon them — even the majority of their own members voted for the Brexit Party.Many others, including me, refused to take part in a ballot that should never have taken place, for an organisation that we should not be part of.No party can last for long with its vote in freefall and its activists staying home or supporting a rival.The Tories must find a way to regain trust, inspire their troops and win back millions of lost voters.That means being completely honest and clear about why this happened. It is human nature to look for comforting excuses to explain away shocking news. But that would be no use.This crisis is entirely self-inflicted. The Conservatives gave the people a referendum and promised, before, during and after, to do as voters decided.Theresa May pledged scores of times that we would leave the EU, deal or no deal, in March.She broke that promise and her Cabinet colleagues let her do it. As Daniel Hannan, one of the Party’s surviving MEPs, put it: “People voted to leave three years ago and we haven’t left, it’s as simple as that.”Many voters were already deeply unhappy about the way the PM kept watering down and abandoning her negotiating red lines. Ditching the Brexit deadline was the last straw and pushed them over the edge. Step one of recovery is clear: Brexit must happen.If there’s a glimmer of hope it’s that May has agreed to resign. Imagineshe was still barricaded in Downing Street — more time would be wasted on the struggle to prise her out of the building.Instead, the race to succeed her has begun. No more politely pretending that “there’s no vacancy”. Instead, the MPs who hope to be the next Prime Minister can openly set out their stalls.There is no time to waste. This has got to be a proper contest, to produce a leader whose abilities and ideas have been thoroughly tested. The stakes are as high.Tory members, disillusioned, frustrated and bruised, want totheir party to winning ways. Democrats want the Leave vote to be honoured.And everyone wants to hear the proposals put forward by those who want to govern.The only option is to get this right and keep that essential promise.

The same pattern was repeated where.In Germany, a surge for the Greens brought the long dominant Christian Democrats their worst result in decades.In France, Marine Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally topped the poll, and the two traditional centrist parties – the Republicans and the Socialists – almost disappeared.Even more dramatic gains for the Eurosceptics could be found in Italy. The nationalist League was far in front, with  per cent of the vote, while the maverick, rebellious Five Star movement won  per cent, putting the Italian anti-EU forces in an absolute majority.Populists also triumphed in Hungary, where Viktor Orban Civic Alliance gained no less than  per cent of the vote, and in Poland, where the right-wing Law and Justice party was victorious with  per cent.Indeed, throughout Europe there were advances for anti-establishment politicians - whether it be the Greens in Ireland or the nationalists in Sweden.As triumphant Greens edge out centre-left and centre-right parties, the EU will become even more polarised and ided, which will make it harder for parliament to .All this change is driven by widespread outrage at the disaster that the EU has inflicted on the countries of Europe.Without any mandate, the unaccountable, power-mad cabal in Brussels has weakened the fabric of the continent.National democracy has been pulverised by the quest for EU unication.National identities have been undermined by mass immigration on an unprecedented scale, particularly after the German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the floodgates in .National economic interests have been sacriced on the altar of the European single currency.The EU fanatics like to paint populism as a form of extremism but, on the contrary, it is the natural response to the removal of democratic rights and freedoms.Across Europe, people want their countries back. They have had enough of betrayal.They prefer to govern themselves rather than be ruled by unelected officials.They are tired of being labelled bigots simply for feeling a sense of patriotism, that noble ideal which is really an extension of love of family.The real extremists are those EU zealots who show contempt for the ideas of national pride and sovereignty.Yet, there is no sign that the Brussels regime, cocooned by its ideology, has woken up to the scale of the upheaval.Just the opposite is true.Since yesterday, the EU ruling elite and its cheerleaders have indulged in a gigantic propaganda exercise, pretending that the results are not that signicant, that the populist insurgency has been exaggerated, that the barbarians have been held at the gates.In this climate of delusion, it is asnothing has happened.An attitude of business as usual prevails, as shown by today’s Brussels summit, where European leaders discussed the preparations for choosing a new EU President and Commission, given that the term of Jean Claude Juncker will soon end.In the time-honoured fashion of the EU’s institutions, another establishment stitch-up is probably on the way.Beyond mouthing a few empty words about reform, Brussels bosses seem to have learned no lesson from the anti-establishment fury.That is because they are so obsessed with the grand European project of political unity.Since its foundation in the s, the entire purpose of European Community has been the creation of a federal superstate.Every policy, every treaty is focused on the mission of ever closer union towards the ultimate goal of a United States of Europe.Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of this crusade. Even democracy and nationhood must be sacriced for the sake of the integrationist dogma.At the entrance to the Visitors Centre in the European Parliament, there is a plaque with the words, “National sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time”, for which the “final remedy is the federal union of the people.”That was written by the British diplomat Lord Lothian, a committed appeaser right up to . His spirit still permeates the corridors of power in Brussels.Federalism explains why the EU is so addicted to the abolition of borders through free movement, because the obliteration of national identities will promote the new concept of European citizenship.Similarly, the creation of the single currency in  was not primarily an economic initiative but a political vehicle to enforce integration by undermining national independence.Through its arrogance, the EU is sowing the seeds for its own destruction.Without change, Brussels will become ever more crisis-ridden, ever more in-debted, ever more unpopular.The betrayal of the public is unsustainable in the long-term. In fact, collapse could arrive swtly in the coming decade, either through another financial crisis or through another major country, like Italy or France, deciding to leave.If the Brussels bosses had any sense, they would abandon their ideological project and instead make the union just a trading bloc of free, independent nations.That is what Britain was meant to have joined in  when we signed up for the Common Market, only to find we were sucked into the federalist quagmire.The British people eventually woke up to this reality.We had the courage to vote for independence - and Brexit is the spark that has helped to fuel the flames of rebellion across the continent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the potential ­leadership contenders privately understand it, as do growing numbers of MPs.The question is whether they are brave enough to place such an unpopular truth before party members.When I predicted six weeks ago that the Conservative Party was headed for a single-figures vote in the European election unless it ditched Theresa May, there was much scoffing.Yes, I was told, things would be bad, but not that bad. Well, on Thursday, we secured . per cent.If we break that vote down by constituency, every single Tory MP loses.The first-past-the-post system is capricious. It protects you until, all of a sudden, it eliminates you.Just ask Scottish Labour.As long as our political debate revolves around Brexit, people are likely to vote for the most hardline pro and anti-Brexit parties.Indeed, the longer this wretched argument goes on, the more radicalised both sides become. Voters identy as Remain or Leave rather than according to their old party alignments.Three years ago, at the time of the referendum campaign, it was still a civil conversation rather than a civil war.The polarisation has come since the result, and it has become worse with every passing week.Most Leavers now want No Deal. Most Remainers want another referendum.The moment when both sides might have accepted a compromise — ideally a Swiss-type solution that would have taken us out of the EU’s political structures while retaining close economic links — has probably passed.So whose fault is it that we are in this situation  Hardliners on both sides must take their share of the blame.Those Remainers who promised to respect the result but then worked to frustrate it have done terrible damage to our politics.Those Leavers who, forgetting everything they said during the campaign, now insist that anything short of No Deal is a betrayal, have likewise destroyed trust in the system.But the chief responsibility lies with Theresa May.It was she who dug in on the wrong issues while conceding on the wrong issues, who mulishly insisted that it was all about immigration, who managed to convince both sides that she was secretly working for the other, who so aggravated EU leaders that, by the end, they were predisposed to reject anything she asked for because it was she who was doing the asking.Worst of all, she called and then lost the  election. From that moment, it was clear that our Parliament was prepared to frustrate Brexit.The EU got the message and started making deliberately absurd and vindictive demands, culminating in the Irish backstop which, incredibly, Theresa May accepted.We now face withdrawal terms so disadvantageous that they are worse than either staying or quitting — exactly as Michel Barnier intended.Which brings us back to the Catch-.Parliament does not intend to allow any government to leave the EU with No Deal, and the Commons Speaker has made clear that he is prepared to bend the rules in any way necessary to secure that end.In normal times, a Conservative leader would go to the country saying: “Give me the mandate I need. If Brussels knows we are ready for No Deal, we will get a good deal. We just need the numbers in Parliament.“Do you want me in charge, or a Marxist nostalgic who refuses to have a position on Brexit ”In normal times, such a leader would win comfortably. But these are not normal times.A large chunk of the electorate is now disposed to blame the Conservatives for the impasse rather than the parties that have actually been voting against Brexit.Nigel Farage has confirmed that he plans to contest every seat at the next election. The idea that he might stand aside in certain constituencies in order to stop Corbyn is based on a misunderstanding of how he operates.He is back at the head of a populist insurgent party.The last thing he wants is to have that party’s grievance addressed and so put himself out of business.Is there any solution  Possibly.It may be that Parliament cannot in fact block a No Deal Brexit. It may be that,forced to choose, MPs will baulk at voting to revoke Article .It may be that France, or another EU state, vetoes any extension beyond October  — though that is unlikely.Or it may be that the Tories could, in fact, win a general election.Perhaps I am wrong about Farage’s motivations, and he will agree to an electoral pact, fighting Labour in the North while standing aside in the South.Or maybe there’s another way out of the jam, one I can’t think of.But what cannot be denied is that the dilemma exists.There is no point in saying, “Just leave!” or “I’ll get us a better deal!” unless you are clear about how you intend to do it.The trouble is that, in the current mood, those are precisely the slogans that many Tory activists want to hear.The candidate who levels with them, who sets out the dilemma honestly and outlines a proposed route out of it, may become unelectable.

Yesterday, he said his Brexit policy was to try for renegotiation.Britain is on course to leave the EU on October  with or without a deal - unless the law is changed to extend further.There is currently no provision for MPs to amend the law to stop Britain leaving without a deal and leadership contenders such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab have warned they may end up going for it.But Mr Bercow’s comments yesterday signal he is willing to help create a way for MPs to block a No Deal Brexit.He said there was “no inevitability” about a No Deal Brexit and dismissed the suggestion that MPs had lost their chance to block No Deal once and for all.The only way to completely rule out a No Deal Brexit is for Britain to revoke Article .A request for a further extension could be blocked by just one EU member state - meaning Britain would leave without a deal on October .Speaking at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC, the Speaker said: “There is a dference between a legal default position and what the interplay of dferent political forces in parliament will facilitate.”He added: “The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable.”“The appetite for the house to have its say has recently been whetted and that appetite is not exhausted. Indeed some would say it’s voracious.“The house will want to have its say. The idea that the house will not have it say is for the birds. Parliament is a big player in this.“The idea that Parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen blasted: “This is further evidence -ever we needed it - of his Remain-supporting bias throughout the Brexit process. He’s a self-proclaimed Remainer who has ripped out every rule of impartiality from the Speaker’s rulebook.“Whoever the new leader of the Conservative party is will have to fight not only a Remain-dominated Parliament but also a Remain-supporting Speaker.”He added: “One thing’s for certain - John Bercow, the impartial Speaker, always has his say - everyday in Parliament, it’s almost like Speaker’s Question Time with Points of Order.”Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “In respect of the Speaker, we are subject to European law until the day we leave and European law is very clear that we leave on a set date unless a request for an extension is made and the EU grants that extension. That’s it.So Parliament only gets its say in terms of legislation, it can’t take over the Government at any stage, it can’t run the legislative programme, so it’s European law that will get the final say.”"},{"url":null,"title":"king albert belgium dna test delphine boel lovechild","story":"Lawyers said yesterday that Belgium’s former King Albert II, , has said he will take the test which will hopefully provide a breakthrough in the long-running case.King Albert II, who abdicated in  for health reasons, had been facing a daily fine of €,for failing to provide his DNA in the case brought by -year-old Delphine Boel.Boel has been trying to establish paternity for years and her story has often made headlines.Albert has never publicly denied being her father but so far had refused to provide DNA.A statement from Alberts lawyer, delivered to the Belgian media, said after the former monarch had taken note of the judgement two weeks ago, which imposed the daily fine, he would submit to the test out of respect to the judicial authorities.It was made clear the move did not imply any admission of guilt.Boels lawyer, Yves-Henri Leleu, said she reacted very positively, because with the DNA test, the biological evidence is now there.The lawyer for the former monarch said the DNA results would have to be sealed until later in the legal case.Rumours about Albert and Boels mother, Sybille de Selys Longchamps, , the aristocratic we of a well-heeled industrialist, have been around for years.But the news the king may have had a child with her broke out into the open when a biography of Alberts we, Queen Paola, was published in .He married Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria in July  and they have two sons and one daughter.Delphine Boel, who was born in , first claimed she was Albert’s “lovechild” in .In June  Boel summoned the then King, the Duke of Brabant and the Archduchess of Austria-Este to appear in court, hoping DNA tests would prove her claims.However, being King at the time, Albert had complete immunity under the law.After Albert abdicated Boel dropped her initial law suit and filed a second one against him as he no longer had immunity.A court hearing in March  ruled that her claim was unfounded and her lawyers said she would appeal the decision.The Court of Appeal decided in October  that Boel was not a descendant of Jacques Boel and ordered the former king to undergo a DNA test.A lawyer for the king initially said he would seek further advice but earlier this year the lawyer initially stated he would not provide a DNA sample.In his Christmas message to the nation that year, King Albert indirectly confessed to a past infidelity and said he and Queen Paola lived through a crisis in the late s that almost wrecked their marriage but that a long while ago they overcame their marital problems.Six years ago Boel opened court proceedings to prove that Albert is her father.An artist and sculptor, Boel has always said that she brought the paternity case due to anger since she was being cold-shouldered by the royal family."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds strictest landlord bans guest alcohol cooking","story":"The list of outrageous demands didn’t just stop there though anda tenant was getting a lt home the driver had to stop at the end of driveway otherwise it would be considered trespassing.It also warns people that the property is under -hour surveillance.Jessica Marteny, from Wilmington, North Carolina exposed the extensive list of rules and regulations in a Facebook group called Awful Roomates: Roomates from Hell.While some of the demands seem perfectly normal, such as requests to keep noise levels down and keeping the place clean and tidy others appear to be excessive.The third rule states: “NO GUESTS!!! No one is permitted on the property but those residing at the residence.”It goes on to add: “Rides must stop at the end of the driveway and let you off accordingly. It [sic] your ride lingers or comes onto the driveway it is considered trespassing and will be handled as such due to posted signs on the property.”Also included in the petty rules and regulations is a ban on tenants adjusting the thermostat evenit got cold - telling them instead to “get an extra blanket”.Cooking was also banned between .pm and am during the week and between .pm and .am on the weekend.No reason was given for this demand.Members of the Facebook group were up in arms about the demands from the landlord with one user asking: “Is this guy renting a prison cell ”Another said: “Whatyou have a partner  They cant come over     And no cooking before : on a weekend  Whatyou work on the weekend in the morning and wanna cook breakfast.”A third wrote: “The no guest rule really gets me. Imagine your family visiting you and wanting to see your new place and you get evicted immediately because of that.”Some were more sympathetic to the landlord, suggesting they might have had problems with a tenant in the past.One commentator said: “I dont know, after reading some of the stuff that goes on, it kinda makes you wonder what that dude has been through with roommates.“Seems like hes trying to cover things that have been issues before.”However, the anonymous landlord in the US might face some stf competition for the dubious moniker of the world’s worst landlord.The Sun Online

treating the cooking space as you use it at your home.Another tenant said they had been warned not to take “big s**ts” in the bathroom.In another horror story a renter had said they had been told off

petrol station and bought £. of diesel and also some drinks and snack bars.The inquest then heard about the fake suicide belts.DCI Jolley said: All of the belts consisted of four bottles, covered in silver duct tape attached to a brown belt.The bottles did not contain any liquid.Butt, Redouane and Zaghba were shot dead by police less than  minutes after their murderous attack began.Christine

designed to be put around the neck of a dog and used with a remote control to stop the animal from barking too much.The packaging in which is it sold is labelled in English “Rechargeable and

We must understand this situation.Sherpas are the form of a God in the mountains.We should respect them. And should also respect the mountains.

It was very dficult.Anjali Sharad Kulkarni, , who lived in Mumbai, was among three Indians who died as they attempted to climb the worlds highest mountain, which has seen  deaths already this season.All of the deaths this year have occurred during peak climbing season and has been the deadliest year since  when  climbers died.Officials have issued  permits to tourists and a further  to Nepalese mountaineers to climb the mountain this year after growing safety fears.Experienced climbers expressed concerns over the overcrowding and adventure companies offering cheap packages to unsuitable climbers - resulting in blocking the path.Elia Saikaly, a film maker, said that as he watched the sunrise  it unmasked the dead body of another climber.In an Instagram post he wrote: I cant believe what I saw up there.Death. Carnage. Chaos. Lineups. Dead bodies on the route in tents at camp . People who I tried to turn back ended up dying. People being dragged down. Walking over bodies. Everything you read in the sensational headlines all played out on our summit night. Elia told : There were  plus climbers making their way up to the summit.After first walking in t-shirts, as they get further up the temperature drastically changes, the Himalayan wind icy.Every few moments she had to stop to regain her breath, claiming that each step she took was an effort.She began to feel unwell a few hours before reaching Base Camp and considered turning back. She felt that she had come down with a cold or chest infection.But once she arrived at Base Camp she said that climbers were crying, complaining of lack of sleep, headaches, dizziness.She was checked by guides and locals who said that her oxygen saturation was low but her heart rate was high.The next day she set off at a slow pace, but after stumbling along the path her guide said she had acute mountain sickness and she was taken off the mountain by emergency helicopter.If altitude sickness is ignored, it can lead to le-threatening conditions affecting the brain or lungs. I came across a deceased climber... that persons body was fixed to an anchor point between two safety lines and every single person that was climbing towards the summit had to step over that human being.It’s dficult for people at sea-level, who are not mountaineers, who have never been above , metres, to understand that particular scenario.

The rates burden could be reduced or stamp duty cut.There may even be some room for expenditure in pressing areas such as social care for the elderly or helping the hard-pressed police.£billion is a serious amount of money which could have a signicant domestic effect rather than being little more than overseas aid for rich ­countries.Then we could trade with the EU on the basis of the World Trade Organisation . This provides a framework for treating countries fairly. The UK, in spite of allowing the EU to represent our interests in recent years, has always been a founder member, and as soon as we have left we may resume our rightful place.The WTO allows nations to set tarfs that will then be applied to all other members in the absence of specic free trade deals.The concept of “most favoured nation” means that it is unlawful to discriminate against one country.The effect of this is that the EU could not charge higher tarfs against us than it does on goods from the United States.As the US has seen its trade with the EU grow faster since the introduction of the Single Market than the UK’s has, it is clearly no barrier to successful ­business.Likewise, the UK would have to levy the same payments on EU goods as we do on others — and here we would have a choice.Would we want to lower tarfs generally, cutting the cost of goods for ­consumers, or keep the protectionist ­barriers that make Europe so expensive It seems obvious that we ought to cut tarfs to improve living standards, ­especially for the least well-off in society, allowing them to have more money to save or spend.Historically, nations that have cut the cost of imports have become more prosperous and there are non-tarf barriers that the EU imposes purely to protect inefficient continental industries that could also be removed.Against this opportunity there are many myths that have grown up, fed and watered by those who never wanted to leave the EU.First, they say that the WTO has other agreements tacked on — over  with the US alone — and without them trade would stall.This is a misunderstanding.These add-ons include treaties such as the Paris Climate Accord which are not trade-related.Only about  have any trade relevance of which only one is important and it has already been rolled over.As they are purely technical, rolling them over is not dficult as has already been shown.Other doomsters say that just-in-time delivery cannot work under WTO — which is odd, as it already does.What matters for these processes is certainty of delivery times.The six ­seconds that it takes goods to clear customs in Southampton on average is insignicant compared to potential delays on the M which businesses already have to contend with.The UK already trades extensively and successfully on a WTO basis so ­extending it to the EU would not be problematic.The paranoid and the scaredy-cats also moan that more checks would have to be made, but again that is incorrect.Jon Thompson, the chief executive of Customs and Excise, confirmed that delays would be no worse than they ­currently are for imports.There is no WTO rule to create inefficiencies. The purpose of the organisation is the reverse.

But when  \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA reform to stop re-testing disabled pensioners for their benefits will launch this Friday, the DWP has announced. In future any Personal Independence Paymentclaimants over  will face only a “light touch” review once a decade - instead of stressful full eligibility tests every few years. But charities slammed the DWP for admitting this weekaposs launch is only a partial step. Currently the change will only apply to new claimants who start claiming PIP from Friday onwards. Almost , pensioners who already claim PIP are still waiting for a date when their re-tests will end.    In March, when the reform was unveiled, a DWP press release said their re-tests would end “from Spring of this year”. And Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said the move was imminent. But officials now say the , existing claimants will be brought into the reform “in the coming months”.  There is still no confirmed date. It is thought the DWP is aiming to include existing claimants from the summer. Genevieve Edwards of the MS Society said it was really disappointing that the pledge has been delayed for existing claimants. She added: There are more than , people with MS over the state pension age already claiming PIP. They shouldnapost have to keep going through this stressful process for no apparent reason.  While it’s clearly welcome for new claimants, we know thousands of people who are already on PIP have lost support because assessments don’t work for unpredictable conditions like MS. Vicki Nash of mental health charity Mind added: It’s good news that some new claimants of PIP won’t have to be reassessed for health conditions that aren’t going to change signicantly over the long-term. But this announcement doesn’t go far enough for the hundreds of thousands of people still facing mandatory reassessments. We want to see more people being awarded longer-term PIP payments so they don’t have to face the stress of reassessments. Unless there’s strong evidence that a person’s health has changed, there’s just no need for a series of face-to-face assessments.  Pensioners can only claim PIPthey were already on the benefit, or its predecessor DLA, when they reached the state pension age. New claimants over the state pension age must apply for Attendance Allowance instead. That means this Fridayaposs reform will affect very few people at first. People will only be saved repeat assessmentsthey started claiming PIP from Friday onwards and were under pension age at the time and then reach pension age later on. DWP sources insisted they were moving quickly to roll out the reform in full.  Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said: Stopping unnecessary PIP reviews for people over State Pension age is a positive change. It applies a common-sense approach to treating those whose conditions are unlikely to change. And we want to introduce it as quickly as possible for those who will benefit from it. Minister for Disabled People Justin Tomlinson said: Stopping needless PIP reviews for pensioners is the right thing to do. This step means new claimants to PIP who reach State Pension age before their review is due won’t have one unless they tell us their needs have changed. The next step is to bring this in for all pensioners.

But once elected they wonapost just be the Brexit Prime Minister. Their inbox will be overflowing with a range of issues that will demand action and decision making from the heart of British government. So what have the Conservatives standing to be the next party leader, and PM, said are their policy priorities except for Brexit  The Tory frontrunner is staying tight-lipped about what he might actually think when it comes to policy. Perhaps not surprising for a man who famously wrote two op-eds, one Leave and one Remain, before deciding who to back in the  referendum. It is also born out of political necessity. If you ask Tory insiders they say that Mr Johnson will win any race IF he gets to the final two, after Tory MPs whittle down the herd. But across Westminster MPs have spent time building up doubts about the straw-haired showman. So while the others are flouting their policy credentials, Mr Johnson is quietly trying to shore up support among his colleagues in Parliament. Dominic Raab    The former Brexit Secretary is a favourite among some of the Conservative Partyaposs members who think George Osborneaposs austerity drive was a bit socialist. He has already promised to shrink the state and slash public spending. It is a move that is certain to be popular with the well-fed Tories of SW, but not with Britainaposs cash strapped public services. He wants to reduce the basic rate of income tax from p to p over time - including a p drop straight away - and lower national insurance by raising the threshold. Mr Raab claimed there was £bn of headroom in the public finances to make the move. But he also admitted itaposd involve slashing back government through efficiency savings - a front often used for cuts in David Cameronaposs era. He told the BBC: We would have a spending review... cut down the number of Whitehall departments, cut out the bureaucracy, Iaposd have a special commission looking at public sector procurement particularly in the NHS and MOD. Then I would recycle roughly half of that into frontline services - teachers, schools, nurses - and half of that into the tax cuts for the future. Rory Stewart    The International Development Secretary has said Britain lacks serious people in politics with serious approaches to solve our problems. So perhaps not surprisingly he has one of the most developed policy s in the race, and perhaps the most eccentric way of communicating it Mr Stewart has been walking around public places inviting people to take part in debates in a bid to demonstrate his belief that the Tories need to reach out to people who might previously have ignored the party. He has pledged to double spending on climate change and the environment as he warned the UK must do more in the face of an environmental cataclysm. The International Development Secretary warned a million species could be lost and  million more people could be plunged into poverty unless more is done. Speaking on Sky News, Mr Stewart also said he would double the UKaposs diplomatic budget and completely reframe the intelligence services. Esther McVey    The former welfare slasher - who once branded the rise of food banks positive and defended the vile Bedroom Tax - has vowed to target public sector workers and low earners for votes. She has vowed to cut taxes - without saying which - and slash £billion from the foreign aid budget and spend it on school and police.But she refused to match Labour ’s pledge to hire , police officers after the Tories slashed more than , since  - claiming it was a “gimmicky figure”.Matt Hancock    The Health Secretary and former advisor to George Osborne have said he would lead Britain in a digital revolution - saying he has the youth and energy to transform Britainaposs economy to work in the st century. He has also hit out at the what he claimed was growing hostility to business in the Conservative party. Mr Hancock told the Financial Times that the Conservatives should be backing business not bashing business as he said: To the people who say ‘f**k business’, I say ‘f**k, f**k business’. Speaking to the BBC he felt so strongly about business because that is where I came from. His family wrote the software which helps websites find your address when you type in your postcode. Michael Gove    Environment Secretary Michael Gove has pushed a successful,small scale, policy agenda at his current department. Plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds will be banned in the UK from next April under a green policy agenda spearheaded by Mr Gove. He has also said he will offer free British citizenship to three million eligible EU nationalshe becomes Prime Minister. It will see him waive the £, fee to EU nationals living in the UK at the time of the  referendum. It is believed there are around three million people who this would apply to once they have been a British resident for five year Jeremy Hunt    Still relatively policy light, Mr Hunt has been stepping slightly outside his brief in the last few weeks as part of his leadership bid. The Foreign Secretary used a major policy speech to the Lord Mayor’s Banquet at London’s Mansion House to back calls for extra cash for the military - a key plea from high-profile Conservative backbenchers. Britain is one of a handful of NATO nations to meet the alliance benchmark of pumping % of GDP into its Armed Forces – and a host of prominent Tory backbenchers want a lt. Many see it as a rallying point for hawkish right-wingers, and a potential party leadership candidate would boost their hopes by pressing for a rise. Warning of the mounting threats from “more aggressive Russia and a more assertive China”, Mr Hunt said: “I believe it is time for the next Strategic Defence and Security Review to ask whether, over the coming decade, we should decisively increase the proportion of GDP we devote to defence. Andrea Leadsom    The former leader of the House of Commons may have precipitated Theresa Mayaposs resignation - and she has strong views on Brexit. But since the race launched she hasnapost said much about what she thinks about anything . Sajid Javid    The Home Secretary has spent much of his political career picking high profile fights with other Conservatives, most notably Theresa May. In that vein, he has come out and said he would partially reverse swingeing Tory cuts to the police and recruit , police officers. He said the move would cost £billion. He has also claimed he would slash red tape to make it easier for police to tackle the rising kne crime on Britainaposs streets. But as Home Secretary Mr Javid has come in for heavy criticism for, among other moves, stripping Isis terror teen Shamina Begum and her newly born baby.Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott wrote on Twitter : It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship.This is callous and inhumane. Kit Malthouse    Housing Minister Kit Malthouse was part of the  intake of Tory MPs and brokered the so-called aposMalthouse compromiseapos Brexit plan - which basically was just Hard Brexit by another name. Unveiling his leadership campaign in The Sun he seemed to suggest a big policy agenda was coming. He said he would pitch himself as a new face, with fresh new ideas, from a new and talented generation. Mr Malthouse vowed to do more to boost green technology, tackle youth violence and turn the Conservatives into the party of well-funded schools - a thinly-veiled swipe at government cuts to school budgets. But he has so far been principle heavy and detail light. James Cleverly  The former Tory deputy chair vowed to offer “something dferent and something new in the campaign. But hasnapost come forward with much yet.

The Scharer family beat  other finalists to move to the idyllic Bardsey Island off North Wales to work as wardens. Farmer Ned, , and his we Sophie, , were due to spend three years on the island managing the nature reserve, a farm and bird observatory with their two children. But on day one -year-old son Sam fell shortly after stepping off the boat and was taken to hospital with a leg injury - and went home with his mum to heal. Ned was left to manage the island on his own and lasted a little over a month, but quickly realised the task ahead was too much for him.  Mrs Scharer said: It was such a shame but in the end, it made the decision to leave the island easier for us because we effectively had no choice. What happened was just one of those things. It could have happened anywhere. Mrs Scharer said Sam had slipped on rocks and had to be taken to hospital by helicopter where he was treated for a leg injury. She said: The warden has a direct line to the coastguard, so even though youaposre on the island, you have this amazing back-up. The seas were too rough to launch the boat so they sent the helicopter.    Sam has only recently healed but he now has a beautul scar in the shape of the island. Itaposs a wonderful souvenir. She said husband Ned found maintaining the island - which has , visitors each year - proved too much for him, and the family have now ed home to Llanwrst in Snowdonia. The mile-long island is known as the Island of , Saints and is said to be the final resting place of thousands of pilgrims. It is now famed for its wildle and rugged scenery - attracting seals, Manx shearwaters, porpoises and dolphins.    Bardsey Island Trust is now seeking new wardens to manage the remote island for the next three years. Wardens are paid an £, salary and offered accommodation and utilities on the island. According to the trust, candidates must be physically fit, comfortable with isolation - and prepared for no phone signal.  Mrs Scharer said: Itaposs an amazing opportunity for a family who love to spend time together and to have an adventure.

The young wizard won the hearts of readers throughout the seven book instalments, after discovering his magical powers at the age of . Harry went on to fight off Dementors, trolls and giant spiders - which were later brought to le through box office hits. Coming in at second was Roald Dahl’s uber intelligent Matilda, closely followed by the author’s loveable protagonist Charlie Bucket from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  The poll of , parents highlights the importance of parental relationships and reading, with many characters and books being passed down through generations. Also making the top  inspirational children’s characters were Mary Poppins, Paddington Bear and Peter Pan. Residents of A.A. Milne’s Hundred Acre Wood proved popular, with Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin and Tigger all featuring in the list. The survey was commissioned by The Works, which is supporting parents in helping their children embrace reading.  Dr Jane Murray, who specialises in early childhood education, said on behalf of The Works: “The research shows how books are as important as ever and the positive impact they have on a child’s development and relationship with their parents and other carers. “At the heart of every story there is a good character and the research shows how nostalgic and classic characters continue to inspire parents and children throughout le. “It’s great to see how adults are helping their children to embrace reading and discover fictional worlds and characters who can influence their child’s behaviour and outlook.”  The research also found the most inspirational book titles included The BFG, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. On average, parents read with their children five times a week and six in  said they really enjoy this time spent with their youngsters. Over half have made ‘story time’ a part of their kids’ bedtime routine most nights, which explains why the most common place to read to them is in the child’s bed.  A further  per cent admit they think it’s important for children to have inspirational characters to look up to in stories and four in  typically try to read books along these lines. Over one third have read a book they loved from their own childhood to their offspring, and  per cent of modern kids ‘loved’ the classic read. Despite this, more parents said today’s books are better than their own youthful stories.  The study proved how reading is still vital to parent and child relationships today, with four in five stating it is one of the best ways to bond with their kids. Almost two thirds admitted they will miss reading with their children once they’re too old. Half of those polled, via OnePoll, said they have had to read ‘lots’ of books over and over again at their child’s demand, with three in  even knowing a book off heart as they’ve read it so many times.  The average amount of times a parent has re-read their child’s favourite book to them is an astonishing . The most popular titles to read multiple times were found to be The Very Hungry Caterpillar, The Gruffalo and We’re Going on a Bear Hunt. Dr Murray added: “Books not only help children to learn, but they also help them to be happier.    A survey of more than , children found that the more books a child owns, the more likely they are to be doing well at school and to be happy with their lives. “Babies attune to the human voice to help them to learn, so when a parent and young child focus together on a book, for example, pointing at pictures and repeating the words together, their joint attention helps the young child to develop important knowledge and skills about language and reading.” Top  inspirational characters from children’s books:Harry Potter Matilda Charlie Bucket, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Hermione Granger, Harry Potter novels by J.K.

Robert Shapley, , mumbled to police at the scene about ious sea creatures being on the road, and later pretended to read an imaginary book about hedgehogs. He pleaded guilty to driving while unfit through drugs when he appeared at Newton Abbot Magistrates’ Court. Police who attended on February  said he was incoherent and mumbled to them about whitebait, octopus and other sea creatures on the road. Shortly after the crash a prankster put up a cut-out of an octopus on a stick in a field close to the crash site - which led to some suggesting the driver may have been telling the truth.  But the court heard Shapley, of Salcombe, Devon, was in fact high on drugs at the time. He told officers: “It got a bit bumpy for a while. I swerved to avoid an octopus” and “it is pretty bad out there having to dodge all that whitebait”. Officers said they found no evidence of an octopus on the road. Philip Sewell, prosecuting, said the crash happened at a junction after Shapley’s car overtook another. His car ended up on its roof in a ditch on the A between Malborough and South Milton.  “He was stumbling around, he wasn’t coherent,” Mr Sewell said. Police were called at about .pm and put him in one of their cars before he was checked over by paramedics. “He continued to talk to the officers, he was talking about squid, octopus and other sea creatures,” Mr Sewell said, adding that he later pretended to be reading an imaginary book about hedgehogs. The drugs in Shapley’s system included morphine, codeine, cannabis, and a by-product of heroin. Simon Colman, defending, said Shapley suffered from depression and anxiety and took prescription drugs and heroin, but did not remember taking anything prior to driving. Magistrates said they took a “very dim view” of his driving and adjourned the case for a report to be prepared about whether he was suitable for a drug rehabilitation requirement.

Instead, she faced exploitation and abuse. She tells us her story... Standing in her bedroom with a tape measure wrapped around her hips, Leanne Maskell fought back tears. No matter how little she ate, she was never thin enough for her modelling agency. But at ft in and a size eight, she’d nothing left to lose. “It was horrible. I was told I wouldn’t get any work unless I lost three centimetres from my hips. “But there was no way for me to lose that kind of weight without starving myself,” says Leanne, . Leanne began modelling at  after her mum sent a picture to an agency. She worked for some of ­fashion’s top brands, appeared in British and French Vogue, and walked the catwalks at fashion weeks in Paris and London. But despite her success, the pressures of modelling left Leanne suffering anxiety.    Now she wants to lt the lid on an industry she says is re with bullying, sexual abuse and exploitation. As a child, Leanne never considered a career in modelling. Years of playground bullying left her with low self-esteem. So she was stunned when a modelling agency wanted her. “I went from being the girl who was bullied to the girl who was a model. It was great,” she says.    But her dad was worried from the outset. “He wanted to cut my hair off so I couldn’t model any more,” she says. “He was wary and didn’t want me to be a part of it so young.” And with good reason. As a teen, Leanne was subjected to weekly weigh-ins and was forced to send food diaries to her agency. She lost weight, but struggled with anorexia and bulimia. While studying law at university she modelled on the side. But beneath the glamour, Leanne was earning barely any money. She explains that it’s common practice for models to sign power of attorney to their agency to sign contracts for them. This means the agency can rack up debt in the model’s name.  “They book shoots, hair appointments and travel for models. Without asking, the agency will loan the model the money, then start charging interest,” she says. “I told the agency I didn’t want them to lend me any money without me knowing, but within the first week I owed £,. They booked me on shoots I had to pay for myself, then added interest. “When I complained, they said: ‘It’s not debt, it’s an investment in your career’.” In the end, Leanne became so anxious her GP advised her to leave the agency. “It was making me ill,” she says. On top of this, she says there was no protection against predatory men. “Once, I had a horrible shoot with a guy in his bedroom,” Leanne recalls. “He tried to make me take my clothes off and I didn’t want to, so I ran to the bathroom and called my agent, who told me to leave. It was scary and horrible.” Another time Leanne was being harassed on social media by a porn photographer. So she was horried when her agents booked her on a shoot with him. “The shoot was at his house. I was furious and refused to go. I couldn’t believe they’d booked it without checking him out.”  Leanne says sexual abuse is common. “People want you to pose sexually or kiss other models, ­especially at castings. “You’re expected to get naked in front of people as a matter of course. You feel like an object.” Leanne quit modelling for good this year and is now a legal policy adviser. She is keen to expose the dark side of modelling, saying “I want to stop others being taken advantage of”. She says a lot of the time fashion images are misleading. “I was doing shoots for fashion magazines when I was . “The models people compare themselves to are teenagers and children a lot of the time. It’s an unrealistic image,” she says. Since quitting, Leanne is much happier. “I feel so much better about myself and my body now,” she says. “I’d never join a modelling agency again. It’s nice to go to work and not have people scrutinising how I look.”The Model Manesto by Leanne Maskellis out now."},{"url":null,"title":"monster mum dad put children","story":"NewsMonster mum and dad put children through worst abuse police had ever seenThe mum and dad kept one of their sons locked naked in a faeces-covered room and squeezed his genitals as punishmentShareByArun LalChris kitching:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPolice say it was one of the worst cases they have ever seen\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn evil mother and father who horrically abused their children in one of the worst cases of child cruelty police have ever seen have been jailed. The monster couple, who cannot be named to protect their children, kept one of their sons locked naked in a squalid excrement-covered bedroom with no mattress or light bulb. The boy was also subjected to beatings, having his genitals squeezed as punishment, and fed scraps of food left by the other children in the house. His siblings were ordered to beat their brother as a punishment and they themselves were made to sleep on bare, dirty mattresses with springs poking out of them. This all happened while the couple, from Northampton, slept in their own clean, fully-furnished bedroom and kept several perfectly usable mattresses locked in a spare bedroom. The parents - who abused the children over a seven year period - showed no emotion after they were convicted of six counts of wilful neglect and child cruelty at Northampton Crown Court.     The father was jailed for a total of  years to run concurrently meaning he will actually serve seven years behind bars. The mother was sentenced to a total of . years but will serve just three and a half years in prison. The court heard that when police raided the coupleaposs home in  they found one of the boyaposs bedroom covered in excrement. A lock and an exterior alarm were fixed to the door and the blind over the curtain was nailed in place. Jailing the couple, His Honour Judge Michael Fowler said: It was nothing less than a cell. When the jury first saw the photographs of the conditions in which [that boy] was kept, they must have wondered what explanation you could advance for what they were looking at. And you could do nothing but tell obvious lies and ignore the reality of the offending. During the five-week trial, the father claimed he did not realise the extent of filthy, unhygienic conditions in the boyaposs bedroom. The judge called this defence fancul, and the jury took only three hours to convict the pair. Addressing the father, the judge said: The children in this case have suffered serious psychological, developmental and emotional harm. He told the pair: Both of you were found guilty of the most serious offences on this indictment. Central to this case is the horric cruelty shown to one boy in particular and it is dficult to contemplate anything much worse than the circumstances in which he was kept. You managed to conceal the extent of your neglect and abuse and you chose to home school a child, a process which is a complete farce, without having the necessary ability or equipment to do so. In fact, no schooling took place and it was during this period of so-called home schooling the neglect of this child reached its height. Not only did you abuse him but you encouraged his siblings to join in. All the children involved have suffered severe emotional and psychological harm at your hands, having been subjected to multiple acts of violence and cruelty over a long period of time. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Nicky Webb, of Northamptonshire Police, said: In  years of working in Child Protection I have never before encountered abuse and neglect on this scale. The investigation involved taking evidence from young children who were asked to recall traumatic and distressing events from their past, recounting details of horric psychological and emotional abuse.

His rivals will no doubt join this unpalatable Dutch auction as they seek to win the backing of a reactionary Tory membership. After nine years of austerity inflicting unprecedented cuts on our public services, the country now faces the prospect of a Prime Minister who will shrink the state still further. It is galling enough to see senior Tories neglect the day job in an egotistical pursuit of power. But it is frightening to think the winner could take the country further to the right on a mission to turbo-charge Thatcherism. This is not a beauty pageant, but an ugly race to the bottom that will leave the country poorer, meaner and more unequal. Who cares  While the Tories indulge in yet another leadership contest, vital areas of reform are left on the wayside. This is especially the case when it comes to caring for the elderly. Despite repeated promises we are still no nearer to seeing the Government’s long-awaited plan for social care. The need for action could not be more pressing. The Health Foundation says the lack of funding and a recruitment crisis have left hundreds of thousands of elderly without the support they need. There could soon be “care deserts” where no help is available. This a legacy which should shame Theresa May and all who served in her government. Give us power Many drivers want to help the environment by switching to electric cars. But there are far too few charging points. If the Government wants us to go green it needs to invest in the infrastructure.

The website uses data from the pub chainaposs app to rank over  drinks by their the alcohol-to-price ratio at every JD Wetherspoons establishment in the country. Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, the computer science and philosophy student said: Itaposs always been a bit of a game trying to get good value alcohol and working out whataposs the most cost-effective way to get drunk, whether thataposs in Tesco or at a pub, so having a way to work it out was the only way to settle it. Going to the Ice Wharf in Camden before a gig inspired me to make this because of how absurdly expensive it was for a Spoons, so the websiteaposs presentation had to be efficient.    Alcohol rankings y according to the branch, but Magners and Abbot Ale regularly come out on top for value, whereas Peach schnapps and vodka monster rank poorly. Users select their local Wetherspoons and the full rankings appear. The website automatically updates whenever the deals or menu changes in a particular branch. Since the data comes from the Wetherspoonsapos official app, only drinks in stock feature in the rankings. Jack quashed any doubt over the websiteaposs purpose, confirming he visits Wetherspoons pubs with his friends to get drunk on a budget.    The websiteaposs founder admitted spending too long trying to perfect the siteaposs design but says he is pleased with the result. Jack added: Since Iaposm doing computer science, Iaposve done some programming and website stuff which made it fairly simple to put the site together. I had to kind of take apart the Spoons app to see how it was getting the drinks data, and then imitate that process with my website to get all the data and calculate the value for each drink.

Andrew Page, prosecuting, said police arrived at the scene and cautioned both Leas with affray Carol was interviewed, but responded no comment to all officersapos questions.

He came in for harsh criticism after the - defeat and admitted he feared for his international future.However, Clarke revealed the Derby County-bound -year-old – who played through the pain of an ankle injury in the last two games of the Reds’ season – expressed his love for pulling on the dark blue of Scotland. The gaffer said: “Graeme’s had a great season for Aberdeen and got himself a great move to Derby County.“He’ll be disappointed he’s not going to be with a Premier League team, but it’s still a big move for Graeme.“He’s one of the few I’ve had a conversation with and he’s raring to go.“He said ‘I just love playing for my country’.”Scotland, who are fth in Group I, continue their qualying campaign against Cyprus at Hampden on June , before travelling to Brussels to face group favourites Belgium on June .Shinnie, who has been capped six times for Scotland, is leaving Pittodrie for Derby after agreeing a three-year deal with the Rams.The Pride Park outfit narrowly missed promotion to the English top-flight in Monday’s Premier League play-off final against Aston Villa .Meanwhile, McKenna’s inclusion in Clarke’s maiden squad came as no surprise.The -year-old has become a stalwart for both Aberdeen and his country, and captained the side against Peru last summer.Devlin was a more surprising call-up. The ex-Hamilton Accies skipper was set to make his international debut under McLeish, but was injured in training in November.As a result, the -year-old only made five starts since early November.All in, Clarke has included five uncapped players in his squad.The others are Livingston goalkeeper Liam Kelly and his former Rugby Park charges Stuart Findlay, Greg Taylor and Eamonn Brophy.Clarke said the time of year he is trying to shape his squad meant some of those he wanted to call up were unavailable, with others missing out due to injury.He said: “This squad of players all want to be here and that’s the main thing for me.“It’s dficult for the ones I called last week and tried to convince to cancel weddings that they’ve had organised for the last two years or whatever.“It’s really dficult to do that with people.“We have to be understanding that this is the squad that’s available and I think it’s a good squad.“Hopefully in the games you’ll see that.”Clarke said there are “conversations to be had on every single one of” the players missing from the contingent this time.Among the injured are Kieran Tierney and Ryan Christie , Callum Paterson , David Bates , Ryan Jackand Liam Cooper .Steven Fletcher has asked to be rested, while his Sheffield Wednesday team-mate Barry Bannan wasn’t considered for selection and John Fleckis set to get married on June . Players like Newcastle’s Matt Ritchie remain in international exile.Nevertheless, Clarke thinks he can get two results in his first two matches as Scotland manager, adding: “There’s enough talent in that squad to get results in both games, I’m convinced of that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/5ce7ea0f81ca81.61891080.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet

plans","story":"Hundreds of residents have turned out to view the latest plans to dual the A – and their response has been mixed.The first of four public exhibitions have taken place, giving people a first look at the updated options for the -mile stretch between Huntly and Aberdeen.Transport Scotland has urged residents and community groups to give their views as the Government body pushes forward with its aim of declaring a preferred route before the end of the year. vw, px\"  The number of options have been reduced by Transport Scotland, with two potential routes north of Inverurie dropping out of contention.Transport Scotland is pursing six dferent options which could see as many as seven grade-separated junctions built, including at Colpy and Kintore.The remaining option north of Inverurie bypasses the town near the existing road, linking the B Oldmeldrum Road and the B Rothienorman Road, near Portstown area.A Action, a campaign group calling for the Scottish Government to carry out upgrades on the existing route rather than build a new road, says whatever option is chosen will destroy the countryside.Mel Roberts from the group said: “A Action is very pleased to see the blue and green routes north of Inverurie have been deselected.“In our view, however, this does not address what we consider to be a core issue with the north route – the carving out of potentially  miles of new grade-separated dual carriageway through some of the richest farmland and most beautul countryside to be found in the Garioch.“We have also had it confirmed this route would require a -metre-long bridge across the Don Valley at Tavelty, an area rich in wildle, including many protected species.“By comparison, the AWPR Don crossing is  metres.“We continue to call for the reinstatement of the existing A dual corridor as the optimum route for dualling and otherwise upgrading, to address the objectives of improving safety, congestion and shortening journey times.”Another resident who attended the exhibition was Stephen Goodwin, from Kinmuck.He said: “I think a lot of stunning countryside is going to be lost. It feels very destructive.”Garry Nicholl, , from Colpy, also hit out at the current options. He said: “It is a joke. I don’t know how we are able to afford this project.“The Government’s own study said improvements could be made along the existing road.” vw, px\"  However, a number of residents expressed their delight at certain options being dropped.Peter Wrangham, from Meikle Wartle, said: “We would have sold our housethe deselected routes had gone ahead as they came very close to our home.“We are happy they have been deselected.”David Burt, project manager for the A dualling project, said Transport Scotland was keen for residents to share their opinions on the routes.He said: “We have had a ied response from people.“We have some people who are pleased we have reduced the number of routes, others are providing feedback on current options and how it is affecting their inidual land.”Mr Burt added: “We are working with the A Action group. We are looking to have a meeting with them so we can discuss their concerns further.“We want people to come to the exhibitions so we can get their feedback face to face and attendance has been quite high.”Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, infrastructure and connectivity, said: “The Scottish Government has given a clear commitment to dual the A, which will see delivery of around  miles of upgraded road between Inverness and Aberdeen, a huge task but one we are committed to delivering.“As part of that dualling programme, we are taking forward the design work for the -mile stretch of the route between Huntly and Aberdeen.“Having let local communities see and comment on a series of options last October, we have now reduced the number of options for this challenging section of the A and have made some changes to the options being taken forward as a result of the feedback we have received.”A second exhibition at Wyness Hall in Inverurie was scheduled to take place today before moving to Kinellar Community Hall in Blackburn tomorrow and the Gordon Arms Hotel in Huntly on Friday.All are from noon to pm."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42860481-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42860481-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42860481-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42860481-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lifeboat called to rudderless yacht off north east coast","story":"A leboat rescue operation was launched for a rudderless yacht off the coast of the north-east.The UK Coastguard requested the Peterhead rescue team at .pm yesterday after reports of the vessel in trouble.The yacht, which had two people on board, was unable to steer around two nautical miles east of Peterhead.Leboat volunteers safely towed the vessel into Peterhead Harbour, before standing down at around pm."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/CCM-visit-1-940x534.jpg ","title":"mystery solved why this us government jet was in aberdeen","story":"The mystery behind a United States of America plane pictured at Aberdeen airport has been solved.The aircraft, photographed by plane spotters and pilots, arrived in the city on Monday, before flying out the next day.mdash BruceMay , It#s understood the plane was transporting a number of US senators, including Alaska#s Senator Lisa Murkowski.The group were visiting Aberdeen University along with energy minister Paul Wheelhouse to look at carbon capture and conversion technology that has been pioneered by a spin-out company formed at the institution.Social media commentators speculated the plane could be carrying a member of Donald Trump#s family for a golfing visit or perhaps it was checking out the north-east ahead next week#s state visit.President Trump will reportedly bring his grown up children to Britain for the official visit.Mr Trump will jet in on Monday for the three-day visit and will join the Queen for a traditional state banquet.Donald Trump’s children ‘to accompany president on state visit to Britain’\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress news uk donald-trumps-children-to-accompany-president-on-state-visit-to-britain embed # secretNJLbTM\" data-secret\"NJLbTM\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 06","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIn some ways it is like Groundhog Day, but yet again we are looking at severe cuts in health and social care services.At last week#s Kilmory meeting of the board in charge of these services # see page  # there was frustration at the pace at which these proposed cuts are being brought to the table.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Traditionally the Lordship was held by the MacDonald family.However, following disputes in the fteenth century the Scottish kings sought to curtail the MacDonalds’ influence, and in the s James IV sent a military expedition to sack Finlaggan. Many of the buildings at Finlaggan were destroyed at this time, and over the centuries that followed the site sank into relative obscurity.The reconstruction shows what Finlaggan may have looked like in its glory days when it was the seat of the Council of the Lords of the Isles, and the scene of inauguration ceremonies for the Lords.It depicts the twin islands of Eilean Morand Eilean na Comhairle , and their surroundings on Loch Finlaggan. Interestingly, by the late Middle Ages, the Lords of the Isles’ residence at Finlaggan had little in the way of defensive structures – possibly indicating how secure the MacDonalds felt in the heart of their powerbase on Islay.The reconstruction will be available as an interactive virtual reality experience at the Finlaggan Trust’s visitor centre on Islay. There is also a virtual reality app and an online video.Dr Bess Rhodes said: #Finlaggan was an amazing place to recreate digitally. Even today the islands of Eilean Mor and Eilean na Comhairle are beautul places, and in the Middle Ages they were the site of a remarkable complex of buildings which blended local traditions with wider European trends.#The work by Dr David Caldwell and the Finlaggan Archaeological Project has transformed our understanding of this site – giving us a glimpse of the relative comfort in which the Lords of the Isles and their followers lived, pampering their dogs with decorative collars, and enjoying music, imported wine and board games.#Dr Ray Lafferty, Secretary of the Finlaggan Trust, said: #Despite its impact on the shaping of Scottish culture, Finlaggan and the Lordship remains little known to many.#With this virtual reality reconstruction, we hope to give some sense of the site at the zenith of its power, when MacDonald rule stretched from the Glens of Antrim in Ireland to Buchan in the northeast of Scotland.#PICS:The Great Hall interior. no_aFinlagganReconstructionA general view of the islands. no_aFinlagganReconstructionA peaceful Finlaggan today # but it was not always so quiet. aFinlagganMedieval grave slabs among the ruins of Finlaggan. aFinlaggan"},{"url":null,"title":"three amigos clean up in lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFed up with the amount of rubbish left in the area, Flora Currie, Campbell Ferguson and Iain MacDougall # with support from staff at Lochgilphead Resource Centre # recently carried out a litter pick around the path known as Tesco lane near the resource centre.The collected all sorts of items, from polystyrene takeaway food boxes to bicycle frames.The message from the intrepid trio was: #We care about our environment.#"},{"url":null,"title":"dry spell restricts boats on crinan canal","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDue to the continued exceptionally dry period of weather, and the impact on water resource on the Crinan reservoirs, Scottish Canals have issued the following notice to boat owners restricting passage.Vessels with Deep Draught: From close of business on Friday May  until further notice, Scottish Canals will be unable to offer passage to vessels with a FRESH WATER draught over .m.In addition to this, Scottish Canals would ask that those on passage conserve water by sharing locks with others.A spokesperson continued: #In particular we would ask that you maintain groups on the flights between locks five and  so that we may minimise the water drawn from the summit reach.#We may be required to hold single vessels for a short period to make effective use of the lock.

coordinator who can point them in the direction of services such as volunteer-led social centres.According to the report, the closure of the councilrsquos day services will result in job lossesno suitable alternative positions can be found for day service staff.Officers believe that decommissioning the councilrsquos day services will save pound, in   and deliver a permanent pound, saving from

using day services has reduced in number from  in   to  in .ldquoThere is considerable overlap between day centres and social centres such as providing transport, meals and social

local population and needs. The team will hold a caseload of people who are in need of day time opportunities.ldquoLocal area coordinators engage with people and discuss what interests they have and what activities they would like to be involved in.ldquoActivities can range from pursuing an interest in fishing, attending a walking or gentle exercise group, through to attending a local soup and sandwich club.ldquoWith their knowledge of the locality, local area coordinators build up a range of opportunities for older adults to get involved with and contribute to their local community.ldquoIf they identy a gap in provision, they engage with partners to develop new ideas and groups that meet a communitiesrsquo need.Day service users were contacted by the council on March , after meetings were called by the Kelso and Jedburgh day service teams.However, Galashiels day service users have not been briefed as the council says the decommissioning of day services will ldquonot impact on Oakview in the same way.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos health chief Rob McCulloch-Graham, said: ldquoThe research carried out as part of our review of the provision of support services for older people showed us that the numbers of people using traditional day services was in decline and there was a growing preference for other more effective, localised options.ldquoWe therefore needed to look at introducing more robust, community based models that would enable us to improve options and outcomes for older people and their families.ldquoThe local area coordination approach was already proving successful for other client groups and we were confident that it would be equally beneficial for older adults.ldquoIt would also build on and expand the work of our community capacity building team who coordinate a wide range of popular activities and volunteering opportunities across the region, and our ongoing aim of providing a more community based day opportunity model.ldquoFollowing on from the introduction of the approach in Berwickshire, we are now asking the executive to note our intention to proceed with the expansion across the rest of the Borders, which will include meeting with day service users and their families to explain more about our plans and the benefits that the introduction of a new type of service could bring to them.ldquoBriefings have been held with those members of staff likely to be impacted by the proposals and these will be ongoing should we receive agreement to proceed."},{"url":null,"title":"end of the world cycle event geared down","story":"Kintyre Wheelers Cycling Club#sEnd of the Worldevent, on the weekend of May  and , had attracted some leading Scottish cyclists but across all events, on both days, there were less than two dozen entries.Entry was through the British Cycling website and EOTW was strongly promoted, by its founder, KWCC secretary Robbie Semple, at the recent Scottish Cycling Running and Outdoor Pursuits Show in Glasgow.With one Monday left to go on entries, at the KWCC committee meeting, in Campbeltown last Wednesday, it was decided to change the event from two days to Sunday only.Any entrants have been fully refunded through British Cycling.It will also be classed as a closed event, confined to KWCC members only.The confined status would mean that anyone from outwith Kintyre could still take part by paying the £ to join KWCC, which is a big discount on the EOTW entry fee.The format has not been confirmed but KWCC#s provisional plan includes a  mile time trial and a MACC Runway Rush, which is a sprint race, recently pioneered at the opening weekend of the season.The event may close with an Australian Pursuit Race ,members have any cycling left in their legs.An APR is a handicap race with the slowest away first over a shorter distance than the planned six hour endurance event.A KWCC spokesperson said: #Hopefully In the future we can look at organising something bigger.#It simply wasn’t going to be viable.

Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos.

This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9914036.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-asked-to-conserve-water-to-stop-drought","story":"It comes as most of the country is on

washing car windscreens and lights instead of the whole vehicle.Those affected currently involve customers served by the Tolsta Water Treatment Worksin north Lewis and by the Tarbert WTW in Argyll are being asked to take steps to save water.Other water conservation measures suggested include using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket to wash vehicles and using washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has placed a Moderate Scarcity orange alert in Argyll, the Western Isles, and the northwest of the country.A yellow water scarcity alert exists everywhere  except the Northern Isles and south Scotland, which have an early warning in place.The agency has issued a request to farmers and golf course managers in all areas of Scotland except the south region when using water from burns and small rivers to only irrigate only when necessary and at night to cut evaporation losses.It said water sources used for irrigation of farmland to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate are at risk of becoming \"limited\" in all areas of Scotland.The agency also suggested farmers explore how they and their neighbours in the same river catchment could avoid irrigating at the same time.SEPA said: \"River levels are still extremely low across western Scotland, particularly in the north-west.\"Further evidence of environmental impacts and impacts on private water supplies have been reported and therefore a Moderate Scarcity level has been set for this area.\"Some rainfall is forecast for the north west in the week ahead but it is not yet clear how much this will ease the situation.\"In each river catchment there is some degree of water storage, which can maintain river flows even when it is not raining.This natural water storage is mainly held in lochs and groundwater.SEP says that when natural storage has been depleted it will take a lot of rainfall for levels to recover.Currently loch levels in the north-west were described as \"low for the time of year\" following relatively dry conditions.And groundwater levels along the east coast were described as \"still very low for the time of year\".Scottish Water said that reservoir levels across Scotland were currently at  per cent and \"generally good\".But it said that despite some rainfall in parts of the country at the weekend, Scottish Water hydrologists say it has not helped to replenish to any signicant level water sources in certain areas.A Scottish Water spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore asking customers in these two areas, Tolsta on Lewis and Tarbert in Kintyre, to consider how they use their water and to follow our advice about how they can use water wisely.ldquoThe weather in these areas during most of April and May has been very dry and there has been a drop in reservoir levels that supply the water treatment works which serve our customers there.ldquoWe have a strong and resilient distribution network to keep our customers supplied, but wersquore asking everyone to play their part by considering what they can do to help us maintain supplies.Scottish Water is to attend a series of events across the country over summer as part of a Your Water Your Le campaign to talk to communities about how to use water

to replace her to claim they can strike a swt and better deal with Brussels.Boris Johnson and other hardline Brexiters have claimed they could force the EU to sht its position on the Irish backstop that bedevilled Mrs May.But European Commission president Jean Claude-Juncker yesterday dismissed notions of the EU falling into line for a new Prime Minister, saying: ldquoThere will be no renegotiation.It came as the race for Number  intensied as the field expanded to  with the entry of two more Tory MPs - junior Brexit minister James Cleverly and the former deputy mayor of London under Mr Johnson, Kit Malthouse.Mr Malthouse gave his name to the Malthouse compromise, a plan to replace the Irish backstop with alternative arrangements, that the EU and Number  said was unworkable.Also standing are Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Appearing for the first time in public since announcing her resignation timetable last Friday, Mrs May said her successor had to find ldquoconsensus with other  EU states.At a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to discuss replacements for Mr Juncker and EU Council president Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister admitted the European election results had been ldquodeeply disappointing for the Tories, who collapsed to fth place on a .% vote share.A victory for Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party has seen Tory leadership contenders sht towards a no-deal Brexit in order to fend off a possible general election challenge from the new party.Mrs May said: ldquoIrsquove always taken a view that the best option for the UK is to leave the European Union with a deal. Irsquom not going to comment on the views of inidual candidates.ldquoThere will be a process of selecting my successor as leader of the Conservative party but I continue to have the view that itrsquos best for the UK to leave with a deal.She went on: ldquoOf course the European election results were deeply disappointing for the party. What it shows is the importance of actually delivering Brexit.ldquoI think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and for parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and I hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver Brexit.Mr Hunt, who has the most number of declared supporters among MPs, warned a no-deal Brexit would be ldquopolitical suicide for the Tories.The Foreign Secretary said MPs would block it with a no confidence vote that would force a general election which would probably ldquoannihilate the Tories and ldquoput Jeremy Corbyn in No  by Christmas.He said he would try to reopen negotiations with the EU to achieve a ldquodferent deal.He said: ldquoThat means negotiations that take us out of the customs union while generously respecting legitimate concerns about the Irish border. Why would the EU leaders do that  Because they do not want the shadow of Brexit hanging over them. Go to them with a shared problem and there is a chance of a shared solution.Mr Stewart, the only candidate to rule out no-deal, hit back at suggestions he was a ldquosuicide bomber who was only in the race to clear a path for Mr Gove.He said the remark was in bad taste given his diplomatic experience in Iraq and blamed supporters of Mr Johnson who were worried by his run.The International Development Secretary said: ldquoIrsquom not running tactically - I am running on principle and because I believe we can uny this country and make it a much better place.He also outlined plans for setting up a salaried citizens assembly of  members of the public who would be paid to work out a Brexit plan instead of parliament. He said he had been inspired by Irelandrsquos assembly on abortion.He told the : ldquoI have a lot of confidence that we are one of the most educated and articulate populations on Earth and thatwe had a citizensrsquo assembly they would be able to do what parliament has failed to do: step back, put party politics aside and look at a sensible resolution to this.ldquoYou need a Brexit deal to last for  years ndash the danger of revoke or no deal is that you end up in a very unstable situation. The issues are set up as very binary but actually in Ireland they broke it down to a whole series of dferent questions.Sir Nicholas Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, backed Mr Stewart as the only candidate ldquowho can sort out Brexit, unite our party and restore pride and hope to Britain.Mr Raab launched a campaign video emphasising ldquofairness and said he would like a ldquolegally binding exchange of letters to give the UK a clear exit from the so-called backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"calmac-campaigners-cast-light-on-pier-that-is-too-dark-to-be-safe","story":"Craignure Pier on Mull has weathered the worst of west coast storms, up to  ferries a day and the weight of an astonishing annual , passengers.Now a new dossier of correspondence reveals that it has withstood it all with only the most basic of maintenance.Neglect, say campaigners, means the  concrete and timber jetty is now more than showing its age and earlier this year the structure had to be closed after a piece broke away.Locals and visitors alike are worried and so is Caledonian MacBrayne, the state-owned company whose ferry service from Oban docks at Craignure.After this springrsquos problems a local group, the Mull and Iona Ferry Committee, used Freedom of Information laws to find out just how bad the situation was. It discovered the jetty, owned by Argyll and Bute Council, has lighting that is so bad ferries sometimes had to be cancelled.Ferry committee chairwoman Elizabeth Ferguson said the revelations had been shocking.She said: ldquoAn email of    states: ldquoThe lack of lighting, especially at the pump shed linkspan is causing us serious issues. We had a near miss this morning. Can you please have these addressed as soon as possible Another concerning email from CalMac in  states: ldquoPump shed roof leaking, water dripping into light fittings. Please deal with as a matter of urgency.Fteen months later CalMac raises the leaking roof problem again, emailing the council to say: ldquoAs has been advised for some time now, the pump shed roof leaks into a light fitting, which can be seen smoking inside. This has potential for causing a fire. Can you address ASAP.In October , another email from CalMac reveals: ldquoThe guys are having great dficulty in seeing the heaving lines being thrown during the hours of darkness. The pierhead LED was swapped for sodium, we have repeatedly asked for it to be changed back, but it has never been done.Mrs Ferguson said: ldquoIn the weekly checklists submitted by CalMac between January  and December , lighting faults have been reported on  weeks out of . In other words, over that seven-year period, the pier lighting was only reported fault-free for just  weeks.ldquoPoor lighting at Craignure pier is repeatedly cited by CalMac as one of the reasons for cancellations in hours of darkness and inclement weather, yet the evidence of the weekly checklist and the email correspondence is that not only is the lighting system very poor, but repairs take a long time to be completed.Mrs Ferguson added: ldquoThe port weekly checklists from  to December  report a fender fault of one kind or another for  weeks out of , ie for only  weeks out of seven years did the weekly checklists report that there were no fender faults. Improvements seem to be completely absent. Upgrade of Craignure street lights and pier lighting to LED has been promised for several years, but has yet to materialise.ldquoThe water supply has been leaking without a permanent fix for five years.Craignure Pier is not alone in facing questions over whether it is fit for purpose. Argyll  Bute Council has long faced criticism for the state of infrastructure along a coastline that is longer than Francersquos.It has a multi-million-pound linkspan in Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula that has no car ferry to service. Its pier at Helensburgh has lost its once regular Clyde ferries and needs pound million worth of repairs.Over the years there has been a pattern of problems, such as the specially built jetty extension at Bruichladdich that often could not handle the fuel tanker needed for Islayrsquos whisky distilleries.Islanders and coastal communities are angry, not least because piers make money. CalMacrsquos Oban-Craignure Service is its second busiest. The emails obtained under FoI, including CalMacrsquos weekly port reports, show Argyll  Bute spent only pound, on pier repairs and maintenance, over seven years while it received more than pound million in fees over the same period.Billy McClymont, chairman of Mull Community Council, speaking after the April closure, said: ldquoThe pier takes in almost pound.m a year. Itrsquos the golden goose and itrsquos a real slap in the teeth that they have spent nothing on the pier.Mr McClymont said the community council was set to join Coll, Colonsay and Tiree, in a new Confederation of Islands being planned to fight for a bigger political voice for islanders, as they claim they have been ignored for years by the council and the Scottish Government.This comes despite good news for the island. A new ferry is needed to handle a  per cent increase in the routersquos traffic as a result of the introduction of Road Equivalent Tarf in .But Craignure is not big enough for bigger ships. A recent Scottish Transport Analysis Guide appraisal stated that the north and south berths at the pier were too short for larger ferries.Meanwhile, CalMac has its own headaches, including an ageing fleet, with many past their lespans and more than  years old."},{"url":null,"title":"why-its-time-for-an-advisory-referendum-on-independence","story":"Scotlandrsquos fate currently lies in the hands of , elderly members of the Conservative Party, who will select Britainrsquos next Prime Minister this summer without the voters of Britain having any say at all. These geriatric king-makers intend to install a leader in Nigel Faragersquos image, preferably Boris Johnson. He or she will then propel the UK into the self-inflicted turmoil of a No Deal Brexit.This is madness. Yet Scottish voters will be left watching this doomsday clock tick away inexorably till their economic welfare is sacriced on the altar of Brexit on Halloween. The prospect of No Deal may inspire a wartime spirit among Brexit voters, but the vast majority of Scottish voters see this as an act of wilful self-harm by a political elite who have lost the plot.The Scottish Governmentrsquos chief economic adviser says that No Deal could cost Scotland pound billion in less than a year. This on top of possible food and medicine shortages, and transport disruption as the UK severs its settled relations with its biggest trading partner. The longer-term impact of tarfs and lost markets could, according to the Scottish Government, cost , jobs in Scotland.Project fear  Perhaps. But not even the most starry-eyed Brexiter believes that No Deal would be cost-free. The question is: what can the Scottish government, and Holyrood, do to prevent this  Nicola Sturgeon says she wants an independence referendum in late , but by then, the damage will already have been done.I have argued against an advisory referendum on independence for the obvious reasons: Unionists would boycott it and Westminster would ignore it. But the way things are going, there may not be time to wait around for a Section  Order that never arrives. The situation is becoming critical.The Scottish Parliament needs to think carefully today about how it intends to respond to the reckless behaviour of the governing party in the UK.Gone are the visions of a smooth and orderly transition to Brexit, negotiated in goodwill with Brussels. Theresa Mayrsquos likely successors ndash Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey ndash are behaving like intoxicated football fans before an away match. ldquoCome on you Brussels they slur, ldquo you think yoursquore hard enough.Even those who would prefer negotiation, like the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, are being swept way by No Deal fever. No sooner had he said that leaving without a deal would be ldquopolitical suicide than his rivals were vying with each other to don the suicide vest. They yearn for a breakdown in relations with Europe, the better to express their pugnacious nationalism.Theresa Mayrsquos EU Withdrawal Deal, which took two years to negotiate, is dead and another cannot be renegotiated before the end of the current Brextension on October . In fact, one of the conditions of the extension, we now learn, was that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened. There is, as Britainrsquos first female prime minister put it, no alternative.Anyway, there wonrsquot be a Brussels to negotiate with because both the President of the Council and the President of the European Commission are standing down and their successors wonrsquot be in place until November when Britain will already have left.This means Britain is heading like an express train for a clf-edge Brexit in five short months.

However, todayrsquos bill does not actually legislate for Indyref . It merely provides the technical framework for a referendumand when Westminster agrees to make it legally binding by passing a Section  order. And the chances of that happening are precisely zero.For a start there is no prime minister to receive a Section  request. Theresa May has been reduced to the status of a piece of constitutional furniture for Donald Trumprsquos state visit. Her successor will be even less likely to contemplate breaking up the UK before the UK has departed from the EU. In fact, the prospect of any UK prime minister, Labour or Tory, agreeing to a Scottish referendum until well into the next decade seems remote.Yet, the case for a repeat referendum on Scottish independence is surely stronger than the case for the repeat Brexit referendum now advocated by Labour and the rejuvenated Liberal Democrats. Scots were told in  that only by remaining in the UK could they be sure of remaining in the EU. Now they are faced, not just with leaving Europe against their will, but crashing out of it in the worst possible terms.

Right now, the only thing that can be said with confidence is that itrsquos far too early to deliver a verdict on her tenure as prime minister. Only after a considerable passage of time, when emotions have cooled, and events moved on, will it be possible ndash and fair ndash to assess her role with honesty. Historical evaluation requires distance and dispassion. And, while that sometimes allows appreciation of hitherto under-rated and admirable aspects of a personality, it often also results in a more damning perspective.That said, future researchers seem unlikely to unearth anything exceptionally salacious about Mrs May in the archives. On that front she can sleep easy. Recent revelations about Martin Luther King, on the other hand, by his Pulitzer prize-winning biographer David Garrow, threaten to damage his reputation beyond repair. Almost overnight he has been transformed from charismatic political and spiritual leader to disgraceful sexual predator.The about-turn in his popular image follows the release of tape recordings by the FBI which, on Edgar J Hooverrsquos orders, bugged the civil rights campaignerrsquos hotel rooms. In so doing, they captured King in the act of watching and offering advice while a woman was raped by a fellow preacher. On other occasions they record his involvement in profoundly abusive acts on female parishioners and others, including a prostitute who described ldquogetting scared during a threesome with King and a second woman.These tapes establish Kingrsquos extramarital relationships as numbering around -. Infidelity on this scale among the once-revered is not particularly new, merely confirming that, as with so many supposedly ldquogreat men, in matters of his marriage vows King was a hypocrite of the first order. The real scandal is learning the extent of his depravity and acts of sexual coercion. Garrow admits the material on these tapes is shocking, and ldquoposes so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible.Cataclysmic new information such as this is what every biographer, who thought they had nailed their subject, dreads. Yet opinion on public figures is always shting, even without a dramatic turn of events. Already attitudes towards those such as Margaret Thatcher and Richard Nixon are turning,not precisely in their favour then with diminished harshness.

Caro, a former journalist, began his literary career with The Power Broker, a groundbreaking biography of New York legend Robert Moses. Moses was the charismatic, brilliant and venal urban planner who had politicians and building contractors eating out of his palm, while the cityrsquos poor were royally shafted. Carorsquos fascination was as much with the nature of power as with the man who wielded it so cunningly.It is Carorsquos magisterial biography of President Lyndon Johnson, however, for which he is best known. With the fth and final volume now in progress, each book has taken years of research. In biographical terms, therersquos probably never been anything to equal this venture. The result is not, as you might fear, a bureaucratic wallowing in the detail of every memo and phone call Johnson made, but a rich account of the presidentrsquos times. Out of this painstaking but imaginative reconstruction the man emerges, illuminated from every side. The facts Caro unearths never excuse Johnsonrsquos ignoble actions, but they do help explain why he was not just a cheat and a bully but also far-sighted, courageous and revolutionary.In his recent book, Working, a sliver of professional memoir, Caro outlines some of his thinking when embarking on biography. Anyone interested in piecing together the jigsaw puzzle that is Theresa May ndash or any other political heavyweight for that matter ndash should start here. His intellectual curiosity and tireless spadework irradiate the lives of those about whom he writes. The result is not a simple conclusion on whether somebody is essentially decent, well-motivated or corrupt, but a living, breathing portrait of their era, as well as them. Nobody in power, after all, got there by themselves. Just as each of us is composed of countless atoms, so iniduals are a sum of almost infinite parts.

Only after a considerable passage of time, when emotions have cooled, and events moved on, will it be possible ndash and fair ndash to assess her role with honesty. Historical evaluation requires distance and dispassion. And, while that sometimes allows appreciation of hitherto under-rated and admirable aspects of a personality, it often also results in a more damning perspective.That said, future researchers seem unlikely to unearth anything exceptionally salacious about Mrs May in the archives. On that front she can sleep easy. Recent revelations about Martin Luther King, on the other hand, by his Pulitzer prize-winning biographer David Garrow, threaten to damage his reputation beyond repair. Almost overnight he has been transformed from charismatic political and spiritual leader to disgraceful sexual predator.The about-turn in his popular image follows the release of tape recordings by the FBI which, on Edgar J Hooverrsquos orders, bugged the civil rights campaignerrsquos hotel rooms. In so doing, they captured King in the act of watching and offering advice while a woman was raped by a fellow preacher. On other occasions they record his involvement in profoundly abusive acts on female parishioners and others, including a prostitute who described ldquogetting scared during a threesome with King and a second woman.These tapes establish Kingrsquos extramarital relationships as numbering around -. Infidelity on this scale among the once-revered is not particularly new, merely confirming that, as with so many supposedly ldquogreat men, in matters of his marriage vows King was a hypocrite of the first order. The real scandal is learning the extent of his depravity and acts of sexual coercion. Garrow admits the material on these tapes is shocking, and ldquoposes so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible.Cataclysmic new information such as this is what every biographer, who thought they had nailed their subject, dreads. Yet opinion on public figures is always shting, even without a dramatic turn of events. Already attitudes towards those such as Margaret Thatcher and Richard Nixon are turning,not precisely in their favour then with diminished harshness. Several decades on, they are emerging as fully rounded people rather than stock characters playing their black or white, mythologised part in the nationrsquos story.Read more: Is Creative Scotland more dictator than facilitator When it comes to writing political biography that will endure, therersquos no-one to beat Robert Caro, arguably the worldrsquos finest practitioner. Caro, a former journalist, began his literary career with The Power Broker, a groundbreaking biography of New York legend Robert Moses. Moses was the charismatic, brilliant and venal urban planner who had politicians and building contractors eating out of his palm, while the cityrsquos poor were royally shafted. Carorsquos fascination was as much with the nature of power as with the man who wielded it so cunningly.It is Carorsquos magisterial biography of President Lyndon Johnson, however, for which he is best known. With the fth and final volume now in progress, each book has taken years of research. In biographical terms, therersquos probably never been anything to equal this venture. The result is not, as you might fear, a bureaucratic wallowing in the detail of every memo and phone call Johnson made, but a rich account of the presidentrsquos times. Out of this painstaking but imaginative reconstruction the man emerges, illuminated from every side. The facts Caro unearths never excuse Johnsonrsquos ignoble actions, but they do help explain why he was not just a cheat and a bully but also far-sighted, courageous and revolutionary.In his recent book, Working, a sliver of professional memoir, Caro outlines some of his thinking when embarking on biography. Anyone interested in piecing together the jigsaw puzzle that is Theresa May ndash or any other political heavyweight for that matter ndash should start here. His intellectual curiosity and tireless spadework irradiate the lives of those about whom he writes. The result is not a simple conclusion on whether somebody is essentially decent, well-motivated or corrupt, but a living, breathing portrait of their era, as well as them. Nobody in power, after all, got there by themselves. Just as each of us is composed of countless atoms, so iniduals are a sum of almost infinite parts. Mrs May might take some comfort in knowing the ultimate verdict on her career should take all these elements into consideration."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-leadership-hopefuls-rule-out-second-referendum","story":"Home Secretary Sajid Javid,International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and Brexit minister James Cleverlysaid they would refuse to grant Holyrood the necessary power to hold a vote.:SNP MEP Alyn Smith threatened with legal action by Brexit PartyOther candidates to be the next Prime Minister are expected to follow suit.Ms Sturgeon hit back, saying voters would not accept being denied a vote by a Tory PM.Memo to Tory leadership candidates: A majority of Scots - independence supporters and opponents alike - will not accept being told by a Tory PM that we are not lsquoallowedrsquo to choose our own future @theSNP gov https:t.co khEIWdmvapIt followed the First Minister publishing the legislation she hopes will pave the way for a new vote on the constitution in the second half of next year.However the -page Referendums Scotland Bill only applies to issues within the current powers of the Scottish Parliament.In order to form the basis of an independence referendum it would require the transfer of extra powers from Westminster under a so-called Section  order.Ms Sturgeon has said she will ask Westminster for a Section  order in due course, buyut has been unable to say how she would get it from a reluctant government.Theresa May has already refused to grant an order, saying ldquonow is not the time.Now those vying to replace her as Prime Minister have also ruled it out.:Politics Live: Scottish independence legislation to be tabled at HolyroodMr Javid tweeted: ldquoIf I become PM, I wonrsquot allow a second Scottish independence referendum.

The towering incompetence. The faux bonhomie. The Big Ben-sized exclamation mark over his character in general. No thanks to any of it.No wonder Scotlandrsquos First Minister was looking so chipper yesterday. Certainly there were the European election results to smile about, and the publication of her twice in a generation referendum bill.But for the foreseeable future every day that Boris is around is a good day for the FM. The former Bullingdon Club member is the gt to independence who keeps on giving. With him in Downing Street England will look even more like a foreign country where they do things dferently.Contenders rule out indyrefThen again, it might be a Scot who becomes PM. While the race for the Tory leadership could give the starting crowds at the London Marathon a run for their money, a notable addition to the fray this week was one Michael Gove.If you had to create a character least likely to be found as a Tory PM it would surely be the current Environment Secretary. Even Dickens might have thought the Gove story a trle over the top. Abandoned as a baby and adopted at four months old by an Aberdeen fishmonger, he was educated at a state school before winning a scholarship, going private, and from there heading to Oxford. He took up a proper trade,you count journalism as such, which we do in these parts, and became very successful at it.Moving on to politics, he has held major offices, education, justice, the environment, and in each pursued relatively radical policies that take on established interests.If all that is not enough, he wants to wipe out puppy farms. In dog-loving Britain that is catnip indeed. Oh, and he has a spouse who has endless access to the pages of a national newspaper. That sort of thing can come in very handy when a chap has a leadership campaign on the go.Gove: I have conviction to be PMHow much it benefits him remains to be seen. Yesterday, three days after his announcement, Sarah Vine finally confirmed her other half was running for PM. In summing him up, she was her usual chatty self. ldquoLike all husbands, Michael has his flaws: a fondness for corduroy, an inability to go anywherewithout a book, a passion for Wagnerian opera, an obsession with Strictly, an entirely irrational dislike of houseplants and, of course, the usual pathological male inability to operate a dishwasher. The Wagner aside, he seems a pretty straight sort of guy, does he not Then again, so did Tony Blair, who coined the ldquopretty straight sort of guy phrase in  when his government was up to its neck in accusations it had exempted Formula One from a tobacco ad ban infor a donation.The jaunty tone of Ms Vinersquos column yesterday was in contrast to an email she wrote to her husband, and accidentally sent to a stranger, during the  Tory leadership fight. Ahead of a meeting between Mr Johnson and Mr Gove, she urged her spouse to extract a specic guarantee about a top job infor his support, telling him: ldquoThe details can be worked out later on, but without that you have no leverage. From My Weekly to Lady Macbeth, just like that.We know how the  tale turned out, with Mr Gove kning Johnson in the front and deciding to stand himself. That Mr Gove recovered from that very public assassination of a colleague is testament to his skill as a politician and his resilience. He will need plenty of the latterhe does become PM.Bid confirmedHis candidacy in  was a surprise because whenever he he had been asked about the job previously he waved away the notion with a smile. All politicians do. In an interview with the FT in , when he was a Minister in David Cameronrsquos cabinet, he went further. ldquoI donrsquot have what it takes, he said candidly. ldquoI have seen David close up on a iety of occasions ndash he just has an equanimity and a stamina, a sense of calm, good judgment.The piece portrays him, highly accurately as it turned out, as a man in a fearful rush to fulfil his ambitions before a new generation came up behind and pushed him aside.We all present dferent faces to the world, our public selves and our private selves. Most people, one hopes, regard themselves as pretty straight sorts who can be trusted to do the right thing. But the point about running for elected office is that it is a way of testing a personrsquos character and fitness to govern. Yet that is not going to happen here.As matters stand, a future Prime Minister of the UK only has to pass muster with Tory MPs and , party members, plus take part in a few televised debates. In short, only an Emily Maitlis eye roll could stand between the chances of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, or anyone  becoming PM. President Xi Jinping of China must be looking on with envy. Yes, it really is that easy to become a Prime Minister in  Britain.The right thing to do would be to hold a General Election, but no candidate for the Tory leadership would back such a move given the hammering the party suffered in the European elections. So we must endure another contest between the half-good, wholly bad and the outright ugly of the Conservative party. At the very least, the final two contenders should take part in televised debates with the other party leaders, with the FM representing Scotland.Choosing a PM this way would still be an outrage to democracy that no amount of waffling about unwritten constitutions and parliamentary convention could disguise, but at least it would be a test of the candidatesrsquo mettle. The last contender to duck such a test was Theresa May. Just look how that turned out."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8557852.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotlands-eu-workforce-drops-for-the-first-time-in-11-years","story":"There were , non-UK nationals in employment in  -

It is not clear whether the case on Sunday will focus on more than the technical detail that the re-routing was ordered by officials rather than councillors.Speaking last week, Glasgow City Council said the expected scale of the protest would pose a threat of disruption to the community and impact on police resources, ordering the parades to be re-routed.Police had raised fears over the impact the marches and subsequent protests will have on the community saying that they had fresh concerns following protests outside the church at a march last weekend.The priest at St Alphonsus, Canon Thomas White, was spat on during an Orange March last year. This galvanised opposition to parades near churches. A group, Call It Out, was formed and has been organising counter protests.There are concerns over the potential for confrontation. Earlier this month there were  officers at a parade, including specialist riot police. Previously such events was staffed by a dozen or so officers.The Grand Orange Lodge has claimed it and related groups are victims of ldquoanti-protestant persecution and said police are able to manage protests by other organisations without re-routing parades.A spokesman for the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland said: ldquoNow is not a good time to be a Protestant living in Glasgow. The simple act of walking down a street is now effectively banned at certain times.ldquoWearing an item of clothing that identies you as a Protestant will lead to you walking a gauntlet of bigoted protestors who object to your presence simply because you are not of their faith.ldquoDisappointingly, this is aided and abetted by Police Scotland and the SNP-led Glasgow City Council.The Orange Order has been staunchly loyalist to the both the unions of Britain and Ireland and Scotland and England.

He was probably not alone in his surprise.Made for the BBC by Glasgow-based IWC Media , Scotlandrsquos Home of the Year presented a side of the country that is often overlooked. This was affluent, houseproud, le beyond the Central Belt, Scotland. If VisitScotland started a campaign on the back of this show the slogan might be: ldquoScotland: Itrsquos not all Trainspotting you know.The finalists gathered at the House for an Art Lover in Glasgow, where they got to check out photographs of each otherrsquos homes. The judges and viewers, having had a right good nosey - technical term - round the properties in previous programmes, had the better deal. We didnrsquot have to be scrupulously polite about the double pivot windows and that slightly creepy underfloor storage. The judges, though each stated ad tedium how impossible it was to pick a winner, were surprisingly ruthless when it came time to whittle down the seven to three then one.First up was the Stonehaven home with the stuffed badger and other quirky pieces. Michael had not been a fan. The third judge, Kate Spiers, billed as a ldquoglobally renowned lestyle blogger, found herself warming to the large omnivore , but all agreed that the interior of the extension was too modern and did not fit with the rest of the house.Revealed: best place to sell a homeExtended to an hour, the final felt desperately stretched, even with the three judges visiting landmark houses around Scotland. After much faffing around, and standing before the contestants in true MasterChef Great British Bake Off fashion, a winner was announced: the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfriesshire.Stunningly designed inside and out, with magnicent views of the Solway Firth, this was always going to be the one to beat. Kudos to the judges, though, for also choosing the Dalgetty Bay bungalow and the modern design house on Skye. In the end, the judges wisely remembered that this was a home of the year competition, and not a house of the year show. A home looks comfy, inviting, the sort of place in which you would love to spend time. A show house, in contrast, looks like hard work.Scottish Home of the Year was a well made, safe bet of a programme. Like the Dalgetty Bay bungalow, it was never going to win awards for its edginess.

The High Street and Town Centre funds will be welcome, but perhaps it is time also to grasp the thorny issue of business rates.This event will shine the spotlight on how local authorities, retailers, communities and investors are tackling the challenges facing our towns and cities. It comes as the collapse of the high street and the demise of other big businesses has cost taxpayers more than pound billion over the last five years.The huge sum has been paid out by the UK Government to cover redundancy payments and unpaid wages after several large firms were plunged into insolvency.Major retail companies such as BHS, Comet, Toys R Us and Maplin have all gone under, prompting the spike in workers forced to claw back money from the Insolvency Service.

According to a draft of her lecture seen by The Herald, Ms Osowska will say: ldquoThe [CCC] Net Zero report argues we should be releasing  per cent of agricultural land to support emissionsrsquo reductions through afforestation, peatland restoration and biomass production.ldquoFor us in Scotland this is dficult when so much of our food production is underpinned by rural agriculture and fishing communities that are, in places, fragile.ldquoThe same goes for timber production, with ambitions to increase the extent of land under forestry, with inevitable competition with other uses.Ms Osowska and other public sector agencies are keen to send out a message that they want to work with farmers and other landowners rather than against them.Some voices in agriculture have already argued that a climate crisis agenda could spark a gradualto traditional Scottish family farming and crofting, with sustainablepractices such as field rotation.Ms Osowska will add: ldquoIn Scotland, we are now world leaders in peatland restoration, but we can do moreto scale up our efforts and keep the carbon locked up in what are some of the worldrsquos deepest peat deposits.ldquoThe Flow Country, which I am delighted to see is currently being consulted on as a potential World Heritage Site, is arguably our greatest single asset as a lung for nature.ldquoIn northern Scotland the massive tracts of deep peat, with their fantastic open landscapes and some of the highest densities of wading birds recorded anywhere globally, are treasures for nature.ldquoFor farming and forestry we need to think radically and constructively about the transformations needed in how we use the land to simultaneously reduce emissions, protect and enhance nature, and help build resilience against the inevitable impacts of a changing climate. ldquoGlobal heating may be ldquounprecedented and phenomenal but Ms Osowska will add: ldquoItrsquos not too late to act, and a nature-rich future is our best insurance against the climate emergency. ldquoMs Osowskarsquos mantra at SNH has been to lure the people in to caring about nature by helping them to enjoy it - with all the social and health benefits that brings.Authorities, she will say, must work with people ldquoso that everyone understands that healthy, erse nature plays a full and key part in sequestering greenhouse gases and regulating water flows to reduce flood risk.ldquoHealthy nature encourages us to be healthy ndash we want to get out and see nature, enjoy it, and be inspired by it.

I would remind Mr Russell that at the  independence referendum one of the claims made by the No campaign was that the only way Scotlands place in Europe could be assured was by voting No. That was the real \"Great Vote Theft\".Mr Russell claims that \"before the EU referendum the SNP said that a vote for it would be a vote against Brexit and not a vote for independence\". I have before me the SNPs EU election leaflet which was delivered to every Scottish household it clearly states: \"Well offer people a choice of a future for Scotland as an independent, European nation.\"As the SNP came top of the poll in  out of Scotlands  local authority areas, and second in the other two, I think that can be taken as a ringing endorsement of the SNPs position on a second independence referendum. Scotland did not vote in  to have her voice silenced, to be ignored and treated as another English county. We were told not only that we would be an equal partner in the Union, but that we could lead the Union. That could be classed as a Great Vote Lie.

Nevertheless David Cameron, Sir John Major, Nick Clegg, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, George Osborne et al, stated categorically before the EU referendum, that a dferential vote with Scotlandvoting dferently from the UK made a second independence referendum more likely and could lead to the end of the UK.None of those named is a member of the SNP. So it doesnt really matter what was on the ballot paper. The most senior politicians in the UK recognised the signicance of a geographically split vote.

The deftness involved in adjusting positions to suit political ends is nothing short of remarkable.Our First Minister stated during the recent election campaign that one of the reasons people turned out to vote SNP was because the SNP was running the country so well in the devolved spheres of government.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"glad rags and cartridge bags calling all prince charmings","story":"Scotlands premier all female shooting club, Glad Rags  Cartridge Bags is hoping to add a bit of romance to their event in June.It’s a first for the club as Mhairi Morriss owner of Jomm Events and founder of Glad Rags and Cartridge Bags explained: “I have so many wonderful ladies coming to our events, but some have not found their prince charming yet so I thought I would try and give cupid a helping hand by organising a fun evening of clay shooting and supper for all the single lads and lassies.”Mhairi stressed that it will be a fun relaxed evening with all abilities of shot very welcome from complete beginners to the more experienced.

The leboat guild and volunteers were kept busy with hot drinks and homebakes, and several fundraising activities.Hot food was on offer from the Snak Pot, with food donated from Craigie’s Butcher on sale. Orkney Inflatables had a penalty shoot out inflatable, and Lianne Halleran was kept very busy face painting.In the run up to the weekend, ious shops in Kirkwall had RNLI displays in their windows many featuring RNLI wellie boots, promoting the RNLI Mayday fundraiser.Last Thursday night St Magnus Cathedral was lit yellow in support of the RNLI, with Kirkwall RNLI thanking the cathedral custodian and minister for allowing it to happen, as well as thanking everyone for their window displays and supporting them on the open day and throughout the week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself. It#s good to have a hobby, and I don#t find that my sport has a negative effect on the farm.#For more on this story, see next week#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Scotland v Jamaica women#s World Cup warm-up at Hampden is her first ever football match she has already had a shot on the bouncy castle and a Saltire painted on her face. Now she just wants to get inside the stadium and start cheering.Darren, a Rangers fan, has brought Harper for her first experience of the Beautul Game because he thinks it’s a better environment for children. She already enjoys a kick-around. “I also wanted to come because I think seeing the women in the national stadium is a good message to send her. I want her to know football is not just for the boys.” This family is among the thousands making their way into the ground for the women’s national team’s big World Cup send-off. As they wend their way past the street vendors in Mount Florida, it is already clear the previous record of a ,is going to be smashed.At the stadium itself – where fans are pouring out of buses – the crowd is so great it is proving impossible to get them all through the turnstiles some are still queuing  minutes after kick-off.The demographics are interesting too. The mothers and daughters and large groups of schoolgirls are to be expected but there are also plenty of boys brought along by fathersand mixed groups of friends and neighbours. And the age range stretches from tiny babies to pensioners.To those used to attending men’s games, the dference in atmosphere is palpable. There are only a few police horses and no drink is being confiscated.Inside, it feels like a cross between a traditional Scottish football match and a baseball game, with cokes and fries and bonhomie. It is refreshing to sit through + minutes where no-one questions the referee’s eyesight religion or legitimacy, or boos the opposing team’s fans. The first half brings thrills a-plenty. Having spent a lot of time around the men’s game, I wonderI will hear sarky comments about the women’s skill or stamina. But there is nothing but admiration for the standard generally, and the two great first-half goals by Erin Cuthbert and Caroline Weir, in particular.Though most of the people I speak to are relative newcomers to the women’s game, they all seem to know the names of a few of the players.At half time, when the score stands at - for Scotland, Kelly, Olivia and Sonny Tyrrell – a family who stand out on account of their ided loyalties – tell me they have travelled from their home in the north of England specically for the match.Olivia, , is wearing Scotland shorts. She has a Saltire on one cheek and a Jamaica flag on the other and vacillates over which team she is supporting. Her brother, Sonny, eight, who is clutching a cuddly dog, is firmly in the Jamaican camp . “Their nannie is Scottish, and their grampa is Jamaican,” mum, Kelly explains. Olivia recently went to the Liverpool Everton men’s derby. “Is this very dferent ” “Well there’s a lot less shouting and swearing,” she says.In the second half, the sun has stopped shining directly on the pitch which makes it easier to see the action. An early goal by Jamaican forward Khadija Shaw is a blow . But then Sophie Howard makes up for the defensive error that gave Shaw the chance by heading Scotland’s winning goal.When the final whistle blows, and the attendance is revealed to be a staggering ,, everyone is on a high. Stephen Culbertson, his son Alastair, five, and daughter Eilidh, seven, veterans of men’s football at Queen’s Park and Ibrox, say they’ll be back. “It was fantastic – there was some lovely football on display. And it was great to see such a big crowd giving them a proper send-off.” Could there be a better send-off than the Hampden roar  Whatever happens when Scotland play England in their opening World Cup match in Nice a week on Sunday, this evening has been a landmark. After all the years of being treated as second class citizens the country’s female footballers are finally being given the respect and acknowledgement they deserve. “When I was a young kid growing up, girls didn’t play football,” Scotland manager Shelley Kerr says after the game. “We had  players, now there are ,. As a nation we have managed to get , here. It is watershed moment. I never thought I would see that in my letime.” Outside the ground, I catch up with little Harper. She is still on her dad’s shoulders and still smiling. If she continues to play, she will have no shortage of female role models.Meanwhile, her mum, Montana Gemmilland dad are glad they brought her. “It was an excellent performance,” Darren says. “I am really looking forward to the future of the women’s game now.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"life re injected into edinburgh international film festival alistair harkness","story":"The programme launch of the Edinburgh International Film Festival has been a dispiriting affair in recent years, with too few films of note to get excited about and far too many unknown quantities proving they were unknown quantities for a reason.Opening with Edinburgh director Ninian Doff’s properly funny coming-of-age comedy Boyz in the Wood, however, the rd edition of the festival proves there’s le in the old dog yet.There is the UK premieres of Jim Jarmusch’s recent Cannes-opener The Dead Don’t Die, Joanna Hogg’s Sundance-winning The Souvenir and — headlining a commemorative retrospect — Varga by Agnès, the final film by the late, great Agnès Varda.

Kerbside recycling for food waste as well as glass, metal, plastic, paper and cardboard are currently only available to people living in Wigtownshire.Many local residents reacting to the council’s post on Facebook pointed out that their bins would be lighter and less fullrecycling in the area was more widespread.Sharon Cameron said the system was an “absolute shambles”, adding: “How on earth do you knowyour bin is too heavy – what’s the guidance on this, or is it just up to each inidual bin man ”David Gibbons said the area was the “only place I’ve lived where we don’t get a recycling bin or collection and then [the] council complain that one bin for a family gets overfilled”.He added: “I look forward to receiving my bin weighing scales in the post. I’ll also look forward to forwarding on the bill for valeting my car when I’m expected to take waste to the dump.”Lisa Fuller said her bin had been tagged as too heavy by council staff despite the fact that her husband had wheeled it “from the back garden, through the house...down eight steps to the road.” Other residents highlighted the council’s failure to roll out a recycling scheme despite buying thousands of bins seven years ago, which may now never be used.A report published earlier this month said the bins – bought in  to help the council meet its recycling targets – should not be rolled out across the region on cost and health and safety grounds.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish labour on life support after cataclysmic euro election results","story":"Scottish Labour is on #le support# and #facing terminal decline#, a former party chairman has warned.Jamie Glackin hit out at party bosses in the wake of poor results in the European elections - where the party polled just % in Scotland and lost its two MEPs.: Nicola Sturgeon: Scots won’t accept a Tory Prime Minister telling us we can’t choose futureScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard suffered another blow when two of his Holyrood front bench team quit their posts yesterday.Neil Findlay, a close ally of Mr Leonard, stepped down as constitutional relations spokesman, with fellow MSP Daniel Johnson resigning from the justice brief.Mr Glackin blamed UK leader Jeremy Corbyn’s “tin eared” approach on Brexit for the party’s woes, saying that while Labour had tried to appease Leave voters south of the border, this policy had cost votes in Scotland.Writing in the Daily Record newspaper Mr Glackin said: “If I could pull the plug out of the Labour Party and restart it I would.“We are essentially on le support at the moment and facing a terminal decline in Scotland.”In the wake of the European election result, Mr Leonard said he “hoped” Scottish Labour would back a second Brexit referendum in all circumstances, and would campaign for remain.This policy sht is to be voted on when Labour’s Scottish executive committee meets on June .But Mr Glackin said while Labour had been in “bad situations before” - including when the party lost all but one of its Scottish MPs in the  general election - things were now “much worse”.He described the results of the European election as “cataclysmic”, and added: “Jeremy Corbyn and his inner circle have been tin-eared when it comes to Scotland.“A substantial majority of Labour voters in Scotland, as where in the UK, were Remain voters.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

The urban beach has been designed by award winning designer Ian Price, who has devised a space which will accommodate a number of community activities planned for the Ballymena beach this summer.It will be a flexible area that has plenty of space for laying out the beach towels, a dedicated sand sculpture section, and a jetty style promenade.The main feature of the urban beach will be a lighthouse, which is something that Ballymena residents will not be used to seeing in their People’s Park.The space will also be used to host an outdoor cinema and other public s throughout the summer.

Alec is one of  plus people who will be taking part in the exhilarating annual cycling and running event on June  to help raise funds for Cancer Focus Northern Ireland.Alec formerly played for Ballymena United and, back in the s and s, he also played gaelic football at inter-county and provincial level. As well as gaelic football and soccer, he also found time to play rugby for Armoy RFC. He continues to be involved with the local Con Magees, Glenravel Gaelic Club.GOLFERHis main outdoor pastime now is golf and he is a member of local Ballymena Golf Club.While not a regular cyclist, he has taken part in the FROG for many years.Alec is the chairperson of the Glenravel Community Development Association, which is responsible for the operation of the Glenravel Sports and Community Complex – which hosts the FROG event.The complex includes sports facilities, a health and fitness suite, a community play group and has become established as the social hub for the local community.

They do a tremendous amount of work supporting local cancer patients and their families, doing cancer prevention work in the community, funding research at Queen’s University and advocating for better health policies.“Cancer touches so many of us. My brother, Liam, was diagnosed with cancer back in  and had to have a kidney removed. “This was a very challenging time for him and the family. I can fully appreciate the impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on a family. “Thankfully, he has recovered well and has been participating in FROG for the past  years and fully intends to take part in FROG again this year,” he added. “FROG has grown tremendously since it began  years ago and now attracts over  cyclists. We are also building up the number of runners taking part, which is an exciting development.“A lot of preparation goes into organising FROG and the event runs like clockwork. “Organiser Paul McToal and his team deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the work they have put in over the past  years. The event has now become established as a firm date in the cycling calendar for many cyclists and cycling clubs. “While we are well supported by other cycling clubs from right across Northern Ireland, we’d love even more people to join in.“The glens is a fantastic route, so much scenery to enjoy, and there’s a real feel-good factor and tremendous buzz. “The weather has also been very kind to us over the years. What better way to get fresh air, exercise, meet people and help an extremely worthy cause ”COURSEEntrants can choose the FROG cycle, either a mile, mile or  mile route, or FROG legs, a km or  mile run – there’s something for everyone.Participants who raise a minimum amount for Cancer Focus NI will receive a special commemorative top.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

The game seemed to go from end to end and Stuarty Cinnamon was unlucky as he saw his volley saved by the keeper.Seapatricks goal came courtesy of a great free kick. Damien McParland caught the ball sweetly and it nestled into the bottom corner.Seapatrick pressed yet again and Aaron McAvoy volleyed over at the back post. Both teams had penalty shouts turned down, as Bourneview pressed for an equalizer and Seapatrick tried for a second goal. Seapatrick were dealt a cruel blow on the stroke of half time. A corner was floated to the back post, Marty Buchanan looked ashe was impeded and Mark Boyce headed home.The second half started much the same as the first with both teams fighting for every scrap. Bourneview were unlucky not to take the lead when their centre forward sprung the offside trap. As he raced clear he blasted an effort towards the bottom corner but keeper Fletcher was focused and saved with his feet. Clford Sands had a great chance for a Seapatrick second. Stuart Cinnamon weaved his way into the box and as he unselfishly released Sands he screwed his effort wide when well placed.As time ticked away a free kick was awarded to Seapatrick just outside the box. Up stepped a confident Darren Brooker and as he curled his effort to the top corner the ball crashed of the crossbar with the keeper beaten. Seapatrick were to be denied a point in the last minute. A cross came into the Seapatrick box, keeper Fletcher was held and as Ernie Buchanan cleared the ball it bounced of the back of Aaron Gallagher and into the net.

It’s like getting a record out again, all you have to do is just dust it down a bit.”Terry stressed that their Harmony Live performance, along with Irish duo Aslan and The  Of Us, definitely won’t be their last following speculation that circulated at the start of .“We didn’t say anything about final shows, I’ve actually discovered how this happened and it’s usually the venue or the agent who come out with the story.

The couple has moved there after the loss of the family home, Belle Reve, to creditors. Stanley’s suppressed rage at his lot in le finds an outlet when Blanche turns up.Through “nips of whiskey”, “sips of Bourbon” and card games, Blanche’s dreamy posturing and posingcollides head-on with Stanley’s rage and the anger boils over as the play reaches its brutal, violent climax.The production is spot on in its timing, debuting as the fall-out from the#MeToo campaign around the abuse of women continues to gather pace.

Mr Hunt, one of  MPs vying to be the next prime minister, said a failure to solve Brexit could ruin the Conservatives and warned the \"biggest risk\" to delivering on the referendum was a general election. His comments came as Housing Minister Kit Malthouse became the latest person to enter the race to succeed Theresa May, saying there was a \"hunger for someone new\". Mrs May, attending a summit in Brussels, said the European election results in which the Tories took just % of the vote were \"deeply disappointing\". \"I think what it shows is the importance of actually delivering on Brexit. I think the best way to do that is with a deal,\" she said. \"But it will be for my successor and for Parliament to find a way forward and get a consensus.\" The comments are aimed at Brexiteers in the race to replace her who have said they are prepared to back a no-deal departure from the EU, something which could lead to a clash with Parliament. Mr Hunt warned rivals that calling a general election - potentially to win a mandate for a no-deal Brexit - could be a disaster for the Tories.He told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"We must not go back to the electorate asking for their mandate until weve delivered what we promised we would do last time, which is to deliver Brexit, it would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.\" Mr Hunt, who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum but has adopted an increasingly Eurosceptic tone, said he had \"always believed we should keep no deal on the table\" as it is the \"best way of getting a good deal\". He said it was important to \"find a dferent way to get a deal\", adding \"we have to have a go at this\" as he proposed forming a new wider negotiating team to change the Withdrawal Agreement. Leadership rival Dominic Raab also said he was focused on \"getting a fairer deal from the EU as we leave\". But outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed \"there will be no renegotiation\". The agreement between the EU and Mrs May to delay Brexit until October  included a commitment not to seek a renegotiation of the deal. Meanwhile, Mr Malthouse, who brought together Tory Leavers, the DUP and Remainers behind a compromise Brexit plan earlier this year, said he had a \"good number\" of MPs backing his bid. \"Weve got to find a way to unite the Conservative Party to deliver a Brexit plan so we can move onto a really compelling, attractive domestic agenda that might command victory at a general election,\" he said. \"One of the reasons that Im running is that Im the only person who has actually done that.\"Other candidates for the top job also started to offer a flavour of their policies should they win a ballot of Conservative Party members later this year. Michael Gove is prepared to offer free UK citizenship to three million nationals who resided in the UK at the time of the June  referendum. Matt Hancock wrote in the Daily Mail about \"driving up the living wage and cutting taxes\". In response to Mr Hunts warning that a no-deal Brexit election would be \"political suicide\", leadership rival Esther McVey responded: \"Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on October .\" Others vying for the top job include Cabinet colleagues Sajid Javid, Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart, and current bookies favourite Boris Johnson. Meanwhile, Downing Street indicated the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may never be published."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At that time it was reported that someone was soiling the walls with excrement in ious toilets during the weekends.An internal email from May  seen by the Belfastsaid that an incident \"occurred at lunchtime where objects have been thrown out of one of our windows at the front of the building\".Following an investigation, it \"also materialised that staff have been spitting out of windows too\".The email referenced a previous incident in which \"liquid was thrown from one of the windows and hit a member of the public\".Senior managers are looking at ways of addressing unsociable behaviour, with staff being reminded that such matters are disciplinary offences.A further internal email, from May , referenced the closure of the third floor mens toilets in the Plaza Building. It said that \"certain staff members are intent on vandalising them, to the detriment and inconvenience of other staff members\".The email also asked staff to remain vigilant when using the toilets, having \"long since given up on appealing to the better nature\" of the iniduals responsible. A staff member who did not wish to be named said: \"Its disgusting.

public to do so.He has kept a logbook with every ticket from his  journeys from first to last service, some of which began as early as .am and ended around midnight.The Methodist College student was inspired to take on the challenge after a London Tube enthusiast set a world record for visiting all  stations on the Underground in the fastest time.In  Geoff Marshall and travel companion Anthony

safety reasons, it was initially a family affair with mum Andrea and grandmother Norma McClure accompanying him on his journeys with David.\"There were some very obscure routes in the early hours and late at night specically for certain workers, so I was driving behind the bus to make sure he got there safely,\" his dad added.\"Ethan was always very specic about each journey and having the ticket to prove that he had done it.\"Some of the bus routes also only operated on bank holidays, so he had to always find a way to get that one done.\"It also included a few Glider tripsthey happened to be

would never finish the challenge, but he finally got there earlier this week.\"Ethan has been really clever and very committed throughout and hes always been like that.\"Once he gets his teeth into something theres no stopping him.\" For his next challenge, he wants to travel to every local train station in a single day.\"Ethan hopes to complete this in one day over the summer holidays, and since there arent that many stations, its possible,\" his dad added.\"Im sure once thats done hell soon find another transport challenge to try out.\" Translink chief executive Chris Conway praised the schoolboys \"fantastic achievement\". \"Ethan has shown determination and enthusiasm to achieve his goal of becoming the first person to travel every Belfastroute and I would like to personally

If that fails, the SDLP have been clear that Westminster must legislate for an Irish Language Act.\"However, the most important issue right now is getting a government up and running that meets the needs of all our people here.\"The TUV repeated its opposition to an Irish Language Act. A party spokesman said: \"Far from addressing an issue involving discrimination and inequality, an Irish Language Act would actually create such problems. There would be discrimination against non-Irish speakers in employment, particularly in the legal profession and the Civil Service.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

Notwithstanding their success at the polls, the Brexit Party and fellow travellers only managed to equal the number of votes gained by remainers. And in Northern Ireland the election merely underlined that a majority of people here want to remain in the EU.Read MoreMEPs to earn £, plus expenses for four months’ work...Brexit happens in OctoberEilis OHanlon: Why we should celebrate Northern Ireland having three female MEPsAlban Maginness: Old political certainties well and truly swept away by historic Euro electionEU election results: Diane Dodds, Naomi Long and Martina Anderson are Northern Irelands MEPs amid Alliance vote surgeThat is not to dismiss either Brexit or Alliance who performed magnicently, chiefly by giving voters a clear message on where they stood. For Alliance it showed there is a middle ground between the DUP and Sinn Fein and that it is best placed at this moment to occupy it.Now the action switches to Westminster and the backstabbing free-for-all that will pass as a Tory party leadership campaign. Up to  candidates could take part but it seems inevitable that any winner will have to be a committed Brexiteer.That will be music to the ears of the DUP who will continue to hold the balance of power in Parliament and one Tory leadership candidate, Jeremy Hunt, has already promised to include them in his negotiating team, although why they had not insisted in being on Theresa Mays team in the first instance is a puzzle.The problem for any potential new Prime Minister is that none of the candidates has come up with a feasible alternative to the border backstop which has always been the stumbling block in finding an acceptable exit agreement. Brexit is like Northern Irelands devolution impasse. Everyone knows what the problems are but no one is prepared to compromise to break the logjam. The worry in parochial terms is that the current Stormont talks will run into the ground through lack of interest from Westminster, the DUPs pivotal position in Parliament which will demand a lot of the partys energies, and Sinn Feins soul searching after poor election performances in the Republic and a less than glowing effort on this side of the border.Meanwhile, the UK has to leave the EU by Halloween at the latest, a ghoulish prospect given that many of the Tory leadership candidates are avowed leave at any cost purists."},{"url":null,"title":"eilis ohanlon why we should celebrate northern ireland having three female meps","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it comes to grasping at straws, that surely takes some beating.Its hard to argue that Alliance has bagged top boasting rights. Naomi Long more than doubled the Alliance vote, attracting , extra first preferences than Anna Lo did when she stood for the party back in , and the party has become the first to describe itself neither as unionist nor nationalist to take a European Parliament seat for the constituency.Some people will deny that last part. There are always conspiracy theorists on the farther edges of either political tradition who claim to know what Alliance \"really\" stands for.It also remains to be seen whether the results represent a permanent sht away from sectarian politics or just a recalibration of the centre. Another low turn out suggests voters here dont give EU elections that high a priority, even after three years of scare stories about the effect of a no-deal Brexit. The Remain vote only went up fractionally on the  referendum.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetWhats definitely historic is that the three MEPs sent to represent Northern Ireland in Brussels are all women, a detail which, to be honest, I hadnt even noticed until it was pointed out to me. That makes two things worth celebrating. The first is the increasing prominence of female representatives in a society which has been male-dominated for too long. The second is that their presence has become so familiar that its becoming possible to not even pay close attention to their gender.Some might wonder whether the female politicians in Northern Ireland are that much of an improvement on the men. The current impasse at Stormont has been presided over by the DUPs Arlene Foster, Sinn Feins Michelle ONeill and a female Secretary of State after all.That is to miss the point - and those who champion the entry of more women into politics often miss it most spectacularly.Alexandra De La Torre is coordinator of the womens peace project the Next Chapter. Last month she said that the real question to ask about the growing number of female politicians in Northern Ireland is: \"Are they representing all women  Or are they representing the male-oriented politics of their political parties \"With respect, that isnt the \"real\" question at all. Its not womens job to clean up the political sphere, any more than its their job to clean the house. It doesnt matterwomen make anything better. Women have every right to be as useless at politics as the men who came before them.What matters is that theyre there at all, which is why every woman who wins an election represents another small victory, not least in Northern Ireland, where, those totemic leadership roles aside, theyre still in a minority politically.There is something to be said for the argument that having female leaders masks the fact that women still dont have a strong enough voice, but part of the problem is the belief that women have \"a voice\" when the truth is they have lots of voices. Too often women in public le are told that they must say and believe certain things in order to earn respect, especially from other women who call themselves feminists, but whose feminism mainly seems to consist of telling other women what to think and haranguing them when they refuse. Feminists who still think the \"wrong\" sort of women are winning elections are just as guilty of doing down women as the misogynists who think the corridors of power are no place for a woman.Whats refreshing is that the three women who now speak for Northern Ireland at EU level are standing there on their own merits and on the s of their respective parties, rather than playing the \"female card\". They each see their role, rightly, as to represent everyone in Northern Ireland.That theyre all so dferent, in character and background and attitude, is noteworthy too. Diane Dodds was a teacher Naomi Long, an engineer Martina Anderson... well, lets just say she was out of the job market for a long time.When it comes to Brexit and the Union and other issues, their views span the whole spectrum of opinion. To give one example, Diane Dodds is opposed to any attempt to dilute the law on abortion Naomi Long believes that terminations should be decriminalised and made available in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality, but does not support extending the  Abortion Act fully to Northern Ireland Sinn Fein wants abortion liberalised immediately along the lines of the Republic. That seems broadly representative of views across Northern Ireland.There are other dferences too. Diane Dodds is from a rural background the other two grew up in the city, one in Belfast, one in Derry. Anderson is also the only one of the three to have blown up a furniture store in her teenage years, whilst Naomi Long found minor fame as a schoolgirl by appearing on the quiz show Blockbusters. Readers must decide for themselves which was the more admirable adolescent pastime.The important thing is that they are all distinct politically in ways that have little to do with their gender.As it happens, theyre unlikely to get a chance to take up their seats in the European Parliament anyway. The Tories have been so spooked by the rise of the Brexit Party that the new prime minister will feel bound to get the country out of the EU by the October  deadline rather than face another general election. All three seats were filled by women here for the first time, but it was probably also the last time. Just let no one say that the achievement is any less symbolic for that."},{"url":null,"title":"meps to earn 30000 plus expenses for four months work if brexit happens","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

An MEP earns a flat rate of €,. per month, which at the current exchange rate is around £,..They pay EU taxes and an insurance contribution.

This money is to cover hotel bills and food while they are on official business in Brussels or Strasbourg. MEPs are not asked to provided receipts for their stay.However, they do sign a register to confirm that they have attended the European Parliament.Our MEPs will be allowed to claim travel expenses.If they provide receipts, they will be entitled to a complete refund equating to business class air travel and first class rail travel.They are also entitled to p per km for road travel up to a maximum of , km.An MEPs salary is set at .% of the basic salary of a judge at the European Court of Justice.The stronger the pound, the less British MEPs will earn. The weaker the pound, the higher their take-home pay. The three local MEPs are part of a -strong UK representation that will ceasea Brexit deal is agreed.Whoever becomes the next Tory leader in July will attempt to reopen negotiations with Brussels.Any movement before the autumn is highly unlikely.If the EU refuses to change the agreement it offered Mrs May, then a no-deal Brexit becomes a real possibility.The Republic will gain two extra seats after Brexit, and will go from having  MEPs to .Former SDLP leader Mark Durkan had hoped to be one of the two additional new MEPs, but he did not poll well enough in Dublin for Fine Gael."},{"url":null,"title":"full recount ordered for ireland south european parliament constituency","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More than five months have passed, and she has gone home as a healthy infant, weighing five pounds .The baby’s family gave permission to share the story but wanted to stay anonymous, the hospital said.

Micro-preemies can experience vision and hearing problems, developmental issues and a host of other complications.Many do not survive the first year, said Michelle Kling of the March of Dimes, a non-profit that works to improve the health of mothers and babies.So far Saybie has beaten the odds.“She’s a miracle, that’s for sure,” said Kim Norby, another nurse featured in the video."},{"url":null,"title":"israeli parliament vote triggers early election","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But infighting among his allies, and disagreements over proposed bills that would protect Mr Netanyahu from prosecution stymied his efforts to put together a majority coalition.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before voting in the Knesset Rather than concede that task to one of his rivals, Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party advanced a bill to dissolve parliament and send the country to the polls for a second time this year.Had the deadline passed, Israel’s president would have given another politician, most likely opposition leader Benny Gantz, an opportunity to put together a coalition. After the vote, Mr Gantz angrily accused Mr Netanyahu of choosing self-preservation over allowing the country’s political process to run its course.Mr Gantz said that instead of following procedure, Mr Netanyahu opted for “three crazy months” of a new campaign and millions of wasted dollars over new elections because he is “legally incapacitated” by looming indictments.“There is no other reason,” Mr Gantz said.Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party won  seats in the April  election, and his religious and nationalist allies won another , appearing to give him a solid majority in the -seat parliament.But discord between his ultra-Orthodox allies and former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman’s secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party resulted in a deadlock.After the vote, Mr Netanyahu angrily accused Mr Lieberman of making unrealistic demands and forcing an unnecessary election.“He is dragging the entire country for another half a year of elections,” he said.The vote sends the country into uncharted political waters, no less because Mr Netanyahu, the interim prime minister, still faces a likely indictment for a series of corruption charges just around the time of the election."},{"url":null,"title":"derry tourism service industry blasted poverty wages","story":"Businesses within the tourism and service industries in Derry have been strongly criticised for paying staff “poverty wages” despite a recent upsurge in visitors.The comments were made by the Derry Trades Union Councilwhich met with delegates from the Aegis union and representatives from the Low Pay Commissionin the city.The DTUC has called on the local tourism and services sector to justy its low pay policy which is forcing families to foodbanks and leaving greater numbers in poverty.Last year leading accountancy firm, ASM Chartered Accountants, published a bellwether report on the tourism industry in NI which described Derry as the “star of the show”.It said the city had turned a corner through growing occupancy rates which brought about improved profitability of .% in  compared to .% in .With that increase in demand came a very substantial improvement in room rates which increased by .% year on year to an overall average of £..A record number of cruise ships are also set to dock in the city this year, according to Visit Derry.Commenting after the meeting on the need to hold large employers to account, Aegis Divisional Secretary, Gareth Moore, said: \"We welcome the visit from the LPC and the opportunity to highlight the damage that poverty wages has on workers, their families and their communities.“In the current economic situation where record levels of employment coincide with record levels of foodbank use and workers in poverty, there is a necessity for wages to be increased to a real living wage.“We cannot accept the current situation where full-time workers are struggling to survive from month to month, falling further into debt and relying on foodbanks to get by.“Aegis, along with our comrade in the DTUC, will be very active this year in challenging large employers who refuse to pay a real living wage to their staff while those at the top live lavish lestyles.”ExploitationThe Low Pay Commission is an independent body that advises the government about the National Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage.Niall McCarroll of Unison and Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Councilhas thrown down the gauntlet to local businesses to end exploitation and urged them to pay workers a living wage.He said: “DTUC officers along with our colleagues from UNISON Community Branch, Foyle Health Branch, Derry Education and Aegis collectively provided a voice for local workers when we met the Low Pay Commission in Derry.“DTUC used the opportunity to impress upon the LPC the precarious and unstable nature of employment across the City and District and how the scourge of low pay leaves workers and their families struggling to have any decent standards of living.“These demoralising standards of living are no more prevalent than within the localtourism and service industry where basic minimum wage and zero hour contacts are used by commerce groups and employers to maximise profits at the expense of local people.”Mr McCarroll continued: “How can this be justied when local hotels are regularly at full capacity and restaurants and cafes also busy and yet poverty pay is the dish of the day.“The LPC assured DTUC that they would report back to government, presenting their findings which included the call from DTUC for a minimum living wage of £ an hour for all workers, no matter what their age.“DTUC are committed to building on our campaign to stand in solidarity with local workers, whilst exposing bad employers and we will be engaging with all newly elected DCSDC councillors to end the exploitation of local workers.”DamagingThe Northern Ireland Hotels Federationis the representative body for the hotel sector.NIHF Chief Executive, Janice Gault, described accusations of low pay as \"very damaging\" to an industry which has \"done much to improve its image\".She said: \"Our members are subject to the same legal and employment framework as other sectors. Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland. They have already visited Belfast and Balmoral Show.Over the next two weeks will visit other places including Lisnaskea, Portadown, Ballymoney and Derry.There is still plenty of time to sign up at www.edenprojectcommunities thebiglunchhomepage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businessman calls for work to be completed quickly  ","story":"IRISH Street businessman Darren Trainor said the public realm scheme needs to be completed quickly for the benefit of everyone in the town.He saidthose in charge of the scheme told traders that they planned to deploy more men to finish it earlier they would put up with the disruption for a just a little longer.And asking for businesses to be provided with up-to-date information, Mr Trainor appealed to those in charge ldquocome and talk to us.He continued: ldquoWe received a letter informing us that the work would be completed on March .

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to

households  ","story":"A PROVINCE-WIDE recycling survey carried out last month has claimed that one third of householders in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area were unhappy with how the local authority had asked them to recycle.The survey mdash carried out by polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk mdash revealed that only % of those surveyed would recycle when it was convenient for them.The survey revealed that of those who said they would recycle only when it was convenient, % indicated that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling, including glass mdash a service that until last month was unavailable in the former Down Council area.In addition, the survey showed that where the council area could lsquocomminglersquo glass in the same bin with the rest of their household recyclables mdash plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard etc mdash householders were on average % happy with their glass collection method, compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more local authorities are seeing the benefits and cost savings achieved by switching to commingling collection services, alongside an ultra-modern Materials Recycling Facilitylike ours that receives, separates and prepares recyclables for productive use where.The Lucid Talk survey was carried out across all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district council

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

The Consortium, which is hosted by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, is comprised of the  councils outside of Belfast. The Consortium will implement an exciting new collaborative programme to drive greater investment in fibre and digital infrastructure across the region.Together the Consortium developed a Northern Ireland bid for £m of LFFN funding from DCMS. This substantial funding award will be used to deliver full fibre to approximately  public sector sites, under the Public-Sector Anchor Tenancy model, by March . The project will enable Councils to signicantly develop their ability to deliver services and improve access for communities and residents. It is hoped that this will be the first of many such investments over the next few years.Minister for Digital Margot James said: “We’re building a Britain that’s fit for the future, and our plans for a national full fibre broadband network underpin our modern Industrial Strategy. This £ million boost for gigabit speeds in Northern Ireland will benefit homes and businesses across the country and I congratulate the Full Fibre Northern Ireland Consortium in its successful bid.”Currently only % of premises in Northern Ireland have access to full fibre connectivity and outside of the major conurbations the figure is much lower. With responsibility for promoting economic development, and local knowledge, the councils within the FFNI Consortium are well positioned to drive fibre infrastructure in areas where it is most needed.Through the FFNI programme the Consortium will therefore help to expand the fibre footprint across the region to ensure Northern Ireland has available and affordable connectivity to support future growth and prosperity.Manhospitalised after hammer attack - P.S.N.I. arrest two men on suspicion of attempted murderUniversal Credit: Ex-gas fitter tells of struggle to keep his home and

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Members of local chapels and churches processed from the Twyn through Dinas Powys passed Tesco at Nica, ending at Bethesda Chapel.Fish and chips sustained around  walkers by the end of the evening.Rev Jon Davis of the Baptist Church and the Revs Carole and Phil Challis of the Methodists led the service with the first hymn, Light of the World. The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The garden has been created by staff and contractors from housebuilders Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes.The custom design incorporates traditional elements of earth, wind, fire and air, and has been purpose-built for the school.Ysgol Y Deri supports a erse range of pupils with specialist needs from ages three to .Rhys Jones said: ldquoItrsquos absolutely phenomenal. Having this facility for all ages and abilities is something that I wish I had when I was younger.ldquoIrsquove been asked to open the garden and Irsquom honoured to be at the school. Irsquove read up a little about it and what theyrsquore doing is outstanding.Caroline Williams, headteacher of primary at Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoThe dedication and hard work of all the volunteers was incredible under dficult conditions, with lots of clay and concrete to dig through. The space was sad and neglected before and now is interesting, welcoming and inviting truly a space for all our learners to explore their senses. The pupils loved exploring it for the first time on Saturday during the official opening.ldquoWe canrsquot thank the teams enough who have brought this project together Barratt David Homes and their volunteers for the financial support and labour, Dunn Landscapes who managed the work daily, Pam Creed for her design and Pughrsquos Garden centre for the donation of the plants, as well as KidsOut for the donation of the musical instruments.Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes managing director Steve Williams said: ldquoEveryone at Barratt gets a day off to volunteer for a charity. So we looked for a project that we could all do together to really make a dference. From the company  people volunteered to work on the project. Itrsquos fair to say we all got a lot out of it. It really warms our hearts to see what wersquove been able to do in four weeks.Blisse Mellons, , and her mother Laura were already using the gardens. ldquoShe likes this one a lot.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team.

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
