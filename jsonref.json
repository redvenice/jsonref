The North also tested short-range missiles on May 4 and 9.Earlier last week, Kim visited a newly built submarine and expressed his satisfaction with its weapons system. North Korea said its deployment was \u0027near at hand.\u0027In a private briefing to lawmakers Wednesday, South Korean military intelligence officers said they\u0027ve determined that the submarine likely has three launch tubes for missiles. If confirmed, it would be North Korea\u0027s first operational submarine with missile launch tubes, some experts said."},{"url":null,"title":"Vietnamese excavator driver shows ingenious method loading vehicle truck","story":"Share this article        But the driver then swivels the arm around and pushes downwards into the ground, lifting the digger into the air.

As he hits Edinburgh with sandwich boards, he explains why he’s never really happy with the resultsTwo light-box tables, like the ones a photographer would use to look at slides and negatives, are set in a corner of Alfredo Jaar’s airy studio in Manhattan. One is suspended from the ceiling, the other standing on the floor directly below it. Over the course of a minute, the suspended table is lowered to meet its twin. A thin black shadow is cast on to the studio’s walls at the moment of closure. As the table rises, the artist is brightly lit again, just as visitors will be when the piece, Lament of the Images, goes on show in Japan (Tate has an earlier version).There are no slides on the table, something that often confuses spectators, even those too young to have seen a slide. And that’s the point, says Jaar. The piece illuminates the onlookers in “a failed attempt to try and get people to see each other”, he says. Jaar is big on failure.For 30 years, the Chilean-born, New York-based artist has been confronting failure – our inability to see, our unwillingness to look, our struggle to communicate – fearlessly tackling some of the darkest horrors of our age, from the Rwanda genocide to the US’s “black site” detention centres and torture rooms. He’s never really happy with the results.“I’m an idealist and a utopian,” he says. “I want to change the world. And so in that sense, I fail all the time because I have failed to change it. I’ve failed to change the reality around me. Even though that was what I was trying to do.”At the Edinburgh art festival, Jaar is failing again. As part of the festival’s commissions programme, he is organising a public artwork that takes its title, I Can’t Go On, I’ll Go On, from the closing words of The Unnamable, a novel by another chronicler of failure, Samuel Beckett.Edinburgh’s Bridge of Sighs (appropriately enough) is home to a large neon sign quoting Beckett’s text, and his words will be spread through the streets of Edinburgh over the course of the festival by performers wearing sandwich boards: I Can’t Go On on their chests, I’ll Go On on their backs. It’s like the characters who used to walk around advertising The End Is Nigh. In this case it’s The End Is Nigh, But Perhaps Not Quite Yet.“It’s about our incapacity to change this reality, even though I keep going, I keep trying. Because this is the only thing I know,” Jaar says.A conversation with him will leave you with a reading list a mile long. He hoovers up the daily news, the only way he says he knows how to work, and salts his chat with quotations from favourite authors, films and magazine pieces. Today he recommends the bleak Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran (“It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late”), the poet Adrienne Rich and the films of Cuban director Tomás Gutiérrez Alea.Beckett’s words trigger a conversation about another favourite writer, Italian neo-Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who wrote about “the pessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will”. Gramsci was the source of another recent Jaar intervention, plastering Rome with posters of another of his quotes: “The old world is dying. The new world is slow to emerge. And in this chiaroscuro, monsters are born.”That chiaroscuro – dark as Caravaggio – is everywhere, Jaar warns. “We live in dark times.” Just look at the climate crisis, he says. “We face extinction. What does it say about us and about the world that the leader trying to change this reality is a little Swedish girl” – Greta Thunberg – “who is 16 years old?”All is not lost, however. “With my will, I have to be optimistic. If not, I would just kill myself,” he says, miming a gun to his head even as he beams another of his frequent, playful smiles. It’s obvious which has the upper hand in the battle between Jaar’s pessimistic intellect and his optimistic will.Born in Chile in 1956, Jaar grew up under the bloody rule of General Augusto Pinochet, the US and UK-backed dictator whose soldiers travelled the country murdering and torturing opponents in a “caravan of death”. Jaar escaped in 1982 after finishing a degree in architecture. The experience has informed his work ever since.“I know fascism when I see it,” Jaar says. When he escaped, “not even in my wildest dreams” did he expect to see the world facing what it is facing now. “We have fascism growing everywhere. In this country, in your country, in half of Europe, in Latin America.”Jaar has been tackling nationalism since at least 1987 when he erected a lightbulb-studded screen in Times Square, A Logo for America, reading: “This is not America.” It was saying the US was part of a continent, not the continent itself, at a time – then as now – of great conflict between the US and its neighbours. It was “a huge controversy. People were saying, ‘This is illegal, how could they let him do it?’” He has restaged the work several times since and its meaning has shifted as the politics have changed. Today, it seems to have been adopted as a comment on Trump, he says. “The semantics of what is America have changed completely and I accept that, gladly.”Today’s problems are different but seem just as dangerous. Thanks to the proliferation of social media and the rise of “fake news”, people are drowning in information and increasingly unable to disentangle truth from lies. “It’s insane,” Jaar says. “When the internet was created, we thought we had found this extraordinary tool that would change our lives. It was going to create the free flow of information, of ideas, with the rest of the world and so on. And now we have discovered the ugly end of these technologies.”He points to the way technology has been used to influence elections, both in the US and the UK, the constant distractions it creates, the undermining of truth. This, he believes, is where art has a role. Art can teach people to see, it can offer a way to get “back to the essential”.In a 2006 piece, The Sound of Silence, Jaar built a mini-theatre dedicated to one image, the Pulitzer-prize winning photographer Kevin Carter’s devastating picture of a starving Sudanese child crouched in a stony field and stalked by a vulture.The idea was to ask viewers to dedicate some time – eight minutes – to the picture and its story. A green light bids you to enter to watch a film that examines the history and politics of the image. Given the average time someone spends in front of a piece in a museum or gallery is 15 to 30 seconds, it’s a big ask, but it’s one Jaar believes is essential. “We see, but we don’t understand, because there is a lack of context. We have not created the models to resolve these problems.”Around the world, people are taught to read, “but who teaches us the influence that images, the media landscape, have? How it changes our vision of the world,” Jaar says. “I really believe that images are not innocent. Every image contains a conception of the world.” And too often those conceptions go unchallenged. The art world – not the art market, Jaar is keen to point out, which is fixated on money – is perhaps the only place where those conceptions are being challenged today, he believes. A place made up of millions of young people “who against the wishes of their families and the pressures of society have decided to become artists and are trying to make sense of the world”.He’s hopeful about the new generations now coming up, new artists, new thinkers, new leaders such as Thunberg. It’s one of the reasons he dedicates a third of his time to teaching. “I learn from them enormously,” he says. Perhaps someone who sees his Edinburgh piece this week will be inspired to make their own work. Perhaps they will offer us a new vision that can help us navigate the darkness. Intellectually, Jaar may be pessimistic about whether others can really succeed where he keeps “failing”. But his will is filled with optimism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d941004377786d607f439fd542378d4ae2bc9eb6/0_1482_2470_1481/master/2470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dfb6cc45dca6773fe1e804ffa3b466e","title":"philip pocock best photograph miriam berlin punk and her rat bestia","story":"‘The punks were sceptical of my presence. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think it was a sign of acceptance’I was in my mid-20s when Cornell Capa, director of the International Center of Photography in New York, recommended me for a job documenting life in the American sector of Berlin while the city was still ided. As a young photographer, I was so nervous. All of these senior German officials were swanning around my studio inspecting my work.I blurted out that I wasn’t American, that I was born in Canada, almost like a confession. I felt I had to tell them. They just looked at me quizzically, laughed and started speaking in German. I have no idea what they thought of me. But I got the job.In the west, I discovered a different side to the disorder. Every Saturday, punks would hang out, drink beer and blare music through their soundsystems. Cars would be set alight and bank windows smashed in. The cops would arrive, teargas them and send them running to find shelter in nearby bars, and the whole cycle would repeat. They were sceptical of me to begin with. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think that was a sign of acceptance.Getting to know them wasn’t easy, and it happened in the strangest of ways. I would carry a bunch of bananas to snack on while I wandered the streets. When I found the punks, I didn’t know what to say, so I offered them bananas. They just laughed at me. But they must have liked it, because they welcomed me into their crew.As I got to know them, I realised they fitted into the idea of the “wall sickness”, but they were the manic side of the depression that reigned in the east. There was something psychotic about punk at the time. These weren’t just weekend punks and “punk” wasn’t just a look – this was their life.The woman in this shot was called Miriam, and the rat on her shoulder is called Bestia. It was a week or so before Reagan was planning to visit, and there were windows smashed all over the city in protest. Despite the violence and the militancy, she was extremely gentle. She was big, much bigger than me, but she had a soft way of gesturing and moving.She invited me to her place, a nearby squat. We hung out, drank tea, took some shots and became friends. She introduced me to her rat, Bestia, who lived in her oven. Being a squat, it had no electricity, so it was perfectly safe. Bestia was almost like a  angel for Miriam, keeping her safe amid the anarchy. I think it was useful to keep guys off her back, too – nobody’s messing when you have a rat draped around your neck.People feel this image represents a moment in Berlin’s history, or the punk movement more broadly, but to me it’s a shot of someone I got to know, who welcomed me into a hard-to-reach scene. It was a doorway for me into other activist and protest scenes, and I remember the time fondly.People seem to think that punk has died, and maybe elements of the aesthetic have. But the spirit of punk was so much more than a look, and I think that lives on, albeit in different forms. I think we saw it in the Occupy movement, within elements of the Arab spring, and I think we are seeing it today in the UK with Extinction Rebellion.Training: Film and television production, New York University.Influences: Diane Arbus, Brassaï, the Capa brothers, Eikoh Hosoe, André Kertész, Dorothea Lange, Helen Levitt, Mary Ellen Mark, László Moholy-Nagy, Gordon Parks, Thomas Ruff, Aaron Siskind, Francesca Woodman.Low point: “A life-changing accident on a film set in 1979.”Top tip: “Draw with your eyes.

After she died, I felt so fucking lonely.” A 25-year-old barrister, Potts had only just passed her bar exams and was working at a criminal law chambers in London, and hoping to be offered tenancy. Within days of her mother’s death, “Miss Potts of Counsel” was back in court, dressed in horse-hair wig and black gown. But by burying her pain it became the foundation of her identity, transforming her into “Grief Girl” and changing the course of her life.Her mother, father and maternal grandfather were all solicitors: “law is in my blood”. Potts had worked hard and loved being able to say she was a barrister: “I looked great in a wig and gown”. But after the death of “my beautiful, brilliant, infuriating, mad mother”, she became anxious and stressed by her work: “I was falling apart”. Her application for tenancy at the chambers was accepted (“This was all I’d wanted”), but she had to leave.Although her mother made the best roast dinners in the world (“her Yorkshire puddings, as befits a Yorkshire woman, were second to none”), baking was unheard of in the Potts household. Surprisingly then, it was in cooking that Potts found solace as her life crumbled around her. In particular, she loved baking, “where temperatures mattered and ingredients needed to be precisely weighed”. She swapped the crown court for cooking school, enrolling on the patisserie diploma course at Le Cordon Bleu, in central London. Why patisserie? Because puddings are joyous and indulgent, and she needed a serious serving of both joy and indulgence in her life. She needed macarons in every colour of the rainbow, “complex and smoky” creme caramels, raspberry and lavender eclairs, cakes smothered in buttercream that was “richer than Rockefeller and less subtle than Liberace in its sweetness”, and petits fours filled with calamansi gel and Szechuan pepper crémeux. If you’re going to quit a career for cake you might as well do it in style.Her gamble paid off. After nine months she passed the gruelling practical exams at Le Cordon Bleu with flying colours: “It might have been a half-baked idea, but it was also a good one.” Of course she still misses her mother desperately but grief has taught her much about herself: “I am a better person for her death”.This is a heart-warming book about death and new beginnings that will delight cake lovers it manages to be moving, funny and mouth-watering in equal measure – a difficult literary confection to master.• A Half Baked Idea: How Grief, Love and Cake Took Me from the Courtroom to Le Cordon Bleu is published by Fig Tree (RRP £14.99).

Can we learn to love it again, asks Dana CzapnikHere’s a thought. Teen angst, once regarded as stubbornly generic, is actually a product of each person’s unique circumstances: gender, race, class, era. Angst is universal, but the content of it is particular.This might explain why Holden Caulfield, once the universal everyteen, does not speak to this generation in the way he’s spoken to young people in the past. Electric Literature gave this explanation of The Catcher in the Rye’s datedness: “If you’re a white, relatively affluent, permanently grouchy young man with no real problems at all, it’s extraordinarily relatable. The problem comes when you’re not. Where’s The Catcher in the Rye for the majority of readers who are too non-young, non-white, and non-male to be able to stand listening to Holden Caulfield feel sorry for himself?”On the one hand, Yes! On the other, Oof!I’ve had conversations about Catcher with undergraduate students in creative writing classes I’ve taught, and every one has complained about disliking Holden. In my limited network of young people, Catcher is not only no longer beloved, it has become something even more tragic: uncool.But is it as simple as Electric Literature posits – that if you’re not white, privileged and male, it’s hard to see yourself in Holden? After all, this is partly why I wrote my coming-of-age novel The Falconer, told from the perspective of a young woman in early 1990s New York. Maybe hating on Holden has turned into its own form of adolescent rebellion. Catcher was an incendiary novel when it was first published and was banned from many school districts. Reading it once felt subversive now it’s a reliable presence on most curriculums. And once adults tell you something’s good, aren’t you supposed to hate it?But it’s not just girls and kids of colour who are turned off by Holden I have found that my white, male students didn’t like him either. I spoke with several New York City public school English teachers, who all confirmed my suspicion that it’s not just Holden’s identity that keeps him from resonating with younger readers – though that’s part of it.Instead, broad shifts within culture have rendered Holden’s malaise annoying instead of resonant. For one thing, the concept of Holden’s total isolation from the adult world – the molten core of the novel – is anathema to kids who have come of age in a culture where they are precious and valued.In Salinger’s era, a struggling, depressed teen had to pick himself up by the bootstraps and be a man. The idea that he could wander through New York for a couple of days, unaccounted for, without any contact from an adult in his life must seem completely foreign to kids today, who are kept on tight leashes. A parent can watch their child’s exact geolocation from a handheld device. Holden had much more freedom, but it came with a heaping side order of neglect.Though young people today are more carefully watched, they’re also looking out at the adult world and seeing very clearly that it has gone absolutely mad. How can one get all worked up about some “phony” classmate or a brother who sold out to Hollywood (is selling out even a thing any more?) when earlier that morning you did an active shooter drill in homeroom? Or when it’s possible the Earth might be uninhabitable within your lifetime and the grownups are doing nothing about it? Holden’s melancholia feels positively quaint in comparison to the problems kids face today.I’ve read Catcher at a few different stages of my life, and it’s changed each time. First at the age of 13, as part of my education as a New York City kid attending a progressive private school on the Upper West Side (just a Central Park away from Holden’s stomping grounds), then again on my own at 17, when I was mainlining ennui and noticing how disappointing people were. So I fell in love.When I was about to graduate college at 21 and feeling that morphine drip of nostalgia that accompanies points of departure in youth, I read Catcher again in search of my old friend. But by then, Holden’s appeal had worn off. I’d figured out sensitive and angry young men usually reserved their sensitivity for themselves. It was like bumping into an old crush and realising that everything you ever liked about them was a projection. After I turned the last page I thought, “What did I ever see in that guy?” As with most things in life, reading Catcher is all about timing.I’m closer now to 40 than to 17. I no longer read to find friends in literature – I read for the writing. So when I recently read the book for the fourth time, I saw something brand new and I think closer to what Salinger intended: a perfectly written portrait of an imperfect character. Every syllable sings. Much of what I saw in this fourth reading, I had completely missed before.Which puts Catcher in a bit of a Catch-22. Kids who are reading to fall in love with a book no longer relate to Holden, and adult readers who appreciate the craftsmanship are too old to be struck by it emotionally.So, here’s my proposal to readers coming to The Catcher in the Rye for the first time now: read it as early as possible in your life. Read it alongside Ralph Ellison, Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Junot Díaz, Toni Morrison, André Aciman and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Hate it if you must. Rail against Holden. Call him a spoiled brat. When it comes to all the money and opportunity he squanders, he is! Let 20 years pass. Let the world wash over you, then read it again. You might see Holden for who he really is. Not a stand-in for every single teenager that ever walked the Earth, but a lonely inidual who finds the injustices of the world intolerable.• The Falconer by Dana Czapnik is out now (Faber \u0026amp Faber)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5fe05fd5157864e4fd85003e468ec5c388fb9c4/0_152_4494_2695/master/4494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=572d6a1cd2c435c0c20dc6be6b242ecc","title":"london stock exchange agrees 22bn deal to buy refinitiv","story":"Deal will increase LSEG’s presence in US and allow expansion into AsiaThe London Stock Exchange Group has agreed a $27bn (£22bn) deal to buy Refinitiv in a move that will transform it into a UK-headquartered, global rival to Michael Bloomberg’s financial news and data business.The all-share deal will allow LSE to take control of Refinitiv, whose Eikon terminals on trading floors challenge those provided by Bloomberg, from a consortium led by Blackstone and including Thomson Reuters, which owns the Reuters news service.“The acquisition of Refinitiv is transformational,” said David Schwimmer, the chief executive of LSEG. “It is a rare and compelling opportunity to combine two world class businesses and create a global financial infrastructure leader.

On the one hand, the sharp fall in the pound threatens to push up inflation, which would normally warrant high interest rates, but on the other hand the UK teeters on the brink of a cliff-edge Brexit, which could plunge the economy into recession.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at trading platform London Capital Group, has looked at this dilemma more closely:The significantly cheaper pound is a rising threat for inflation in Britain. Increasingly expensive imported product prices should translate into a higher consumer price inflation sooner rather than later.Henceforward, the BoE policymakers have a hard task. In one hand, they should give the necessary support to the UK’s economy threatened by a messy Brexit and a kneejerk economic shock in the immediate aftermath of the separation that could happen as early as October 31st. Here is a summary of the action in markets so far today, while we wait for the main event – the Bank of England’s latest interest rate decision and economic forecasts. Stock markets have been rattled by US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell’s remarks that yesterday’s interest rate cut – the first since December 2008, which reversed last year’s tightening – was not the start of long series of rate cuts. Donald Trump was not impressed.The comments have given the US dollar a big boost. It has hit two-year highs against the euro and a basket of six major currencies. Against the pound, the dollar rose to a 2 12 year high of $1.2101 and is still trading near that rate.Closely watched surveys for the UK and eurozone have pained a bleak picture of manufacturing. In the UK, manufacturers cut production at the fastest pace since 2012, while the eurozone’s factories recorded their biggest overall decline in 6 12 years.In other news: the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, has slammed the government’s plans for an emergency budget in October as an “extraordinarily bad idea”.The think-tank director’s stark warning comes after Kit Malthouse, a junior minister in Boris Johnson’s government, suggested on national television there would be an emergency budget in the autumn.My view is that having an early budget in anticipation of a no deal Brexit is an extraordinarily bad idea.It’s hard to come up with a very good reason for doing it.By holding a Budget in the first week of October “you can’t do anything very much that’s going to make any difference by the first week of November,” Johnson said.I am sure that Treasury officials will be advising against it, but I have no sense as to how big the political impetus behind planning for it is.He tweeted: “Make the decisions after, not before, the most crucial piece of information is available.”Reuters have spoken to Gary Lacey, who was buying euros at a money exchange shop in London’s Canary Wharf ahead of a four-day trip to Austria. “I’m disappointed rather than surprised,” he said of the pound’s latest move lower.He recalled the strong euro-sterling rates of the early 2000s, before the pound was pummelled by the global financial crisis and Brexit.The days of €1.60 are probably long gone. But you have to pay or you just don’t go on holiday.The main reason behind the latest decline is the Fed – its chairman Jerome Powell made clear that yesterday’s interest rate cut was not the beginning of a lengthy easing cycle, which lifted the dollar to two-year highs against the euro and other major currencies.But sterling has been under pressure for some time as fears of a no-deal Brexit have intensified in recent days, given the rhetoric from new British prime minister Boris Johnson’s government. The weak manufacturing survey is not helping either.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes UK consumers will continue to offset weak manufacturing production through their spending.The manufacturing sector is reeling from the twin hits of the global slowdown and the shift in the timing of orders due to the original Brexit deadline in March. Looking through the volatility created by the October Brexit deadline, manufacturing likely will drag modestly on growth even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided, due to weak global demand. But with consumers set to enjoy a burst from strong real disposable income growth, thanks partly to a renewed fall in inflation, we continue to expect GDP growth to be close to its trend rate in the second half of this year, persuading the Bank of England to keep Bank Rate on hold, rather than follow other central banks with more stimulus.Seamus Nevin, chief economist at Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation, said this bodes badly for the UK economy as a whole.Today’s numbers prove that the UK economy is undeniably on a downward trajectory with output, new orders, and employment all falling again. Companies are cutting back on both day-to-day spending and capital investment as the downturn in activity continues, reflecting growing fears of a crash out Brexit and worrying global trade conditions.This is not a good time for our economy to be preparing to go it alone. Eurozone Manufacturing PMI also fell, signalling the quickest decline in the region’s manufacturing sector since the peak of the global financial crisis in 2012. This came off the back of the two major economies of France and Germany each suffering a renewed decline. The downturn experienced by the UK’s main trading partners, and slower world economic growth, combined with foreign customers routing supply chains away from the UK in advance of Brexit has hit British business hard in recent months.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, added:A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.New orders fell as businesses used up stockpiled materials, EU businesses moved supply chains out of the UK and weakness in the global economy stifled demand from both domestic and export markets. Unsurprisingly the decline in employment levels followed suit with one of the sharpest cuts to jobs for more than six years as businesses hesitated to keep calm and carry on and build staff levels. However, optimism for the future stayed relatively buoyant, he noted, in the hope that certainty will once again return to UK shores soon and in spite of the increase in no-deal Brexit rhetoric. The purchasing managers\u0027 indices, or PMIs, track services sector companies, manufacturers and building firms around the world.They measure activity, output, business confidence and hiring levels, to produce a health check on how these sectors are performing.PMIs are compiled each month from interviews with \u0027purchasing managers\u0027 at thousands of companies. They produce a single headline figure – anything above 50 indicates a sector is growing, while a figure below 50 shows a contraction.Economists watch these surveys closely as they look ahead to coming months, while the official data, such as gross domestic product and retail sales, tends to be more backward-looking.\u0026nbspRob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said:July saw the UK manufacturing sector suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global economic growth, political uncertainty and the unwinding of earlier Brexit stockpiling activity. Production volumes fell at the fastest pace in seven years as clients delayed, cancelled or re-routed orders away from the UK, leading to a further decline in new work intakes from both domestic and overseas markets. The British manufacturing survey also paints a bleak picture. Manufacturers cut production at the fastest pace in seven years. The headline index stayed at 48.0 in July, the joint-lowest since February 2013. The sub-index measuring output fell to 47 from 47.2 in June, the lowest since July 2012.The headline manufacturing index has signalled a contraction in the eurozone for six months in a row. The reading of 46.5 pointed to the sharpest deterioration in operating conditions since December 2012, IHS Markit said.Factory output and orders are both down markedly as confidence hit its lowest level since December 2012. Firms are also hiring less, with employment recording its sharpest reduction in more than six years.Germany remained a source of weakness, with its manufacturing economy recording its sharpest deterioration in operating conditions for seven years. Austria recorded its lowest PMI level in just under five years, whilst there were also below 50.0 readings seen in France, Ireland, Italy and Spain. In contrast, the Netherlands and Greece continued to expand, although growth in the former was only marginal and unmoved on June’s six-year low. In the eurozone as a whole, the manufacturing sector is declining at the fastest pace since the end of 2012, according to the closely-watched purchasing managers’ index from IHS Markit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety. Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

In May, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, attacked subsidies, saying: “What we are doing is using taxpayers’ money – which means our money – to boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals. In one word: to destroy the world.”The new analysis shows how redirecting some of the fossil fuel subsidies could decisively tip the balance in favour of green energy, making it the cheapest electricity available and instigating a rapid global rollout.The transition from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy is already under way. Annual investment in renewables has been greater than that in fossil fuel electricity generation since 2008 and new renewable capacity has exceeded fossil fuel power each year since 2014.But progress is slow compared with the urgency required, said Bridle. “There is no question that renewables can power the energy system,” he said. “The question now is can we transition quickly enough away from fuels like coal, and subsidy reform is a very obvious step towards that.” Very few ways of cutting emissions actually save governments money, he said.“Taking away subsidies from fossil fuels and channelling them towards clean energy would boost their development at a much faster pace, and help secure our climate goals,” said Ipek Gençsü of the Overseas Development Institute. An added bonus is the social and economic benefits, such as reduced air pollution and health spending, she said.Most experts define fossil fuel subsidies as financial or tax support for those buying fuel or the companies producing it. The IMF also includes the cost of the damage fossil fuel burning causes to climate and health, leading to an estimate of $5.2tn of fossil fuel subsidies in 2017, or $10m a minute. Ending the subsidies would cut global emissions by about a quarter, the IMF estimates, and halve the number of early deaths from fossil fuel air pollution.Bridle said funding fossil fuel subsidies was “madness”, but said ending them could cause short-term price rises and political difficulties, as the benefits of lower costs in the future and reduced air pollution are less obvious.“There are political problems but it is worth persevering because the prize is so big,” he said. “You have to bring people along with you.” Gençsü said governments must ensure that the most vulnerable people were not adversely affected by changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828397ab2923c6df6e002d70a55e9ddc490e6e1f/0_165_5468_3281/master/5468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aa9669758b55cdaba80cc1d881bc645","title":"use your waste water to save street trees experts urge","story":"Dishwater and bathwater can be used to give vital support that councils often cannot afford to young treesInstead of letting your dirty dishwater go down the drain, consider using it to water the trees on your street. That is the message from tree experts, who say survival rates for urban trees could be boosted significantly by volunteers.Russell Miller, a London-based arboricultural consultant, said: “If you plant trees from good stock, at the right time, and provide enough water, you’d lose almost none prematurely. But get that wrong, and more than half can die.”Miller says a big issue is that local council budgets often do not stretch to include proper watering, which is critical in the first three years of a tree’s life. “Watering is less sexy than planting. It’s cheaper to replace them,” he said.New street trees need at least 20 litres of water a week – about two large watering cans – from April to September, especially in hot weather, says Miller. Any tap or grey water, including dishwater, bathwater and water from washing cars, windows and even clothes, is fine, as long as it does not contain bleach.“The idea is not just to plant a million trees, but to establish a million trees,” warned Tony Kirkham, arboretum head at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.Most species of street tree, such as the London plane, are chosen especially for their resilience and tolerance of urban stress. But even these species need years to develop root systems that can find their own sources of moisture among the networks of cables and pipes, and compacted soil under pavements and roads.“Once street trees get stressed it’s difficult for them to bounce back, they really struggle, and have to rely on rain falling the following year,” Kirkham explained. “If this doesn’t happen, the problem is compounded from year to year.”Citizen-led projects are making an impact, and some local councils, including Cambridge, Sheffield, Camden, Kingston-upon-Thames, Waltham, Enfield and Richmond, have started social media campaigns, put signs up on trees and sent out leaflets urging residents to water their local trees.“Councils are hoping for rain, and hoping they’ll survive, but there are heavy losses when it comes to urban tree planting. The public can dramatically improve their chances of survival,” said Kirkham. “Anything we can do to relieve the stress on our trees is a massive bonus, for both our local authorities and our trees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2eab46932a30cb8391b76c60dc040ae10e1052/0_157_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a6f7e10b602737f4434577915b235d7","title":"what should we do with radioactive nuclear waste","story":"The race is on to develop strategies for storing the most dangerous materials on EarthThere’s a small red hammer and sickle flag of the old Soviet Union on my dresser at home. I found it years ago on the floor of a primary school in Pripyat, the town built for workers at the doomed Chernobyl nuclear plant in what is now Ukraine.Perhaps it had been waved by a child at a state occasion, or had been left behind in the rush to evacuate Pripyat after the world’s worst nuclear disaster in April 1986.Less than two miles away, the stricken, crumbling Reactor 4 was one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Everything for miles around, from the mushrooms in the woods to the trucks left in the parking lots to the toys in the nursery and the hospital beds, was radioactive to some degree.Even though a dosimeter showed that after being washed down, the little flag was barely more radioactive than normal background levels found in nature, it should have been packaged up and landfilled as low-level nuclear waste.By contrast, Chernobyl’s Reactor 4 site will remain dangerous for tens of thousands of years. In July 2019, 33 years after the explosion, 200 metric tonnes of uranium, plutonium, liquid fuel and irradiated dust was finally encased below an enormous €1.5bn (£1.35bn) steel and concrete structure taller than the Statue of Liberty. The new sarcophagus will last about 100 years – after which it will deteriorate and future generations will have to decide how to dismantle and store it permanently.Skip forward to Cameron, Texas, on 16 January 2019. This was a nerve-racking day for Liz Muller, cofounder of California startup technology company Deep Isolation and her father, Richard Muller, professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and now chief technology officer at Deep Isolation.The father-daughter team had invited 40 nuclear scientists, US Department of Energy officials, oil and gas professionals, and environmentalists to witness the first attempt to test whether the latest oil-fracking technology could be used to permanently dispose of the most dangerous nuclear waste.At 11.30am, the crew of oil workers used a wire cable to lower an 80cm-long, 20cm-wide, 64kg canister — filled with steel rather than radioactive waste — down a previously drilled borehole. Then, using a tool called a “tractor” invented by the industry to reach horizontally into mile-deep oil reservoirs, they pushed it 120 metres farther away from the borehole through the rock.Five hours later, the crew used the tractor to relocate and collect the canister, attach it to the cable and pull it back to the surface – to the cheers of the workers. Until then, few people in the nuclear industry had believed this could be done.By avoiding the need to excavate large, expensive tunnels to store waste below ground, the Deep Isolation team believes it has found a solution to one of the world’s most intractable environmental problems – how to permanently dispose of and potentially retrieve the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste currently being stored at nuclear power plants and research and military stations around the world.“We showed it could be done,” Elizabeth Muller says. “Horizontal, directional drilling has come a long way recently. This is now an off-the-shelf technology. Using larger canisters, we think about 300 boreholes with tunnels up to two miles long would be able to take much of the US’s high-level nuclear waste. We think we can reduce by two-thirds the cost of permanent storage.”“We are using a technique that’s been made cheap over the last 20 years,” says Richard Muller, who has worked in the shale gas industry. “We realised we could put together the oil and nuclear technologies. One offered the solution to the other. These capsules can be lowered deep down, far deeper than anyone has proposed, and stored underneath a billion tonnes of rock so none of the radiation gets out.”The dilemma of how to manage nuclear waste – radioactive materials routinely produced in large quantities at every stage of nuclear power production, from uranium mining and enrichment to reactor operation and the reprocessing of spent fuel – has taxed the industry, academics and governments for decades.Along with accidents, it has been a major reason for continuing public opposition to the industry’s further expansion despite substantial interest in nuclear’s status as a low-carbon power source that can help mitigate climate change.In 80-odd years of nuclear power, in which more than 450 commercial reactors, many experimental stations and tens of thousands of nuclear warheads have been built, great stockpiles of different levels of waste have accumulated.The rest is made up of vast quantities of what is called low-level and very low-level waste. This comprises scrap metal, paper, plastics, building materials and everything else radioactive involved in the operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities.The consensus is that about 22,000 cubic metres of solid high-level waste has accumulated in temporary storage but not been disposed of (moved to permanent storage) in 14 western countries, along with unknown amounts in China, Russia and at military stations.A further 460,000 cubic metres of intermediate waste is being stored, and about 3.5m cubic metres of low-level waste. About 34,000 cubic metres of new high-level and intermediate waste is generated each year by operating civil reactors, says the WNA.The US, with 59 nuclear power plants comprising 97 working civil reactors, each generating at least several tonnes of high-level waste per year, has about 90,000 tonnes of high-level waste awaiting permanent disposal, according to the US Government Accountability Office.Although it is impossible to come up with a global total because of differences in how quantities are measured and reported, and with some inventories kept secret, other countries harbour significant amounts of waste as well.In the early days of nuclear power, waste of any sort was barely considered. British, American and Russian authorities, among others, dumped nuclear waste – including more than 150,000 tonnes of low-level waste – at sea or in rivers. Since then, billions have been spent trying to identify how best to reduce the amount produced and then store it for what may be eternity.Many ideas have been investigated, but most have been rejected as impractical, too expensive or ecologically unacceptable. They include: shooting it into space isolating it in synthetic rock burying it in ice sheets dumping it on the world’s most isolated islands and dropping it to the bottom of the world’s deepest oceanic trenches.Vertical boreholes up to 5,000 metres deep have also been proposed, and this option is said by some scientists to be promising. But there have been doubts, because it is likely to be nearly impossible to retrieve waste from vertical boreholes.Two scientific developments excite nuclear scientists. One is to build a new generation of advanced fast neutron reactors, which would use the high-level waste as fuel. This slowly emerging “Generation IV” nuclear power programme is billed by the industry as safer and more efficient. But even though such reactors can reduce the degree of hazard the waste poses, they do not solve the issue entirely.“These new reactors will still need a waste repository, likely as large as a repository for the waste produced by the current crop of conventional reactors,” says Allison MacFarlane, director of the Institute for International Science and Technical Policy at the George Washington University and chair of the US nuclear regulatory commission in 2012–14.The other technology that could reduce waste, known as transmutation, aims to reduce radiotoxicity by using lasers to change the composition of dangerous waste. It has been investigated for decades in the UK, US, Sweden and elsewhere but without great success.But the idea was boosted in December 2018 by French Nobel prize–winning physicist Gérard Mourou, who, in his acceptance lecture, said laser beams millions of times brighter than the surface of the sun in bursts that last a millionth of a billionth of a second had the potential to neutralise nuclear waste, reducing its half-life to a few years and its radioactivity to very little.“Nuclear energy may be the best candidate for the future, but we are still left with a lot of dangerous junk. The idea is to transmute this nuclear waste into new forms of atoms which don’t have the problem of radioactivity. What you have to do is to change the makeup of the nucleus,” he said in the lecture.But Mourou accepted that it might take decades before this “extreme light” solution could be deployed to destroy nuclear waste on an industrial scale.After decades of civil nuclear power and billions spent researching different geological sites and ways to best dispose of the waste, the problems are both technical and political, and the consensus of governments and industry is that deep burial is the best solution – at least for the moment.Yet, so far, no country has managed to build a deep repository for high-level waste.“Although almost every nuclear country has, in principle, plans for the eventual burial of the most radioactive waste, only a handful have made any progress and nowhere in the world is there operating an authorised site for the deep geological disposal of the highest level radioactive waste,” says Andrew Blowers, author of The Legacy of Nuclear Power and a former member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, set up to advise the British government on how and where to store nuclear waste.“Currently no options have been able to demonstrate that waste will remain isolated from the environment over the tens to hundreds of thousands of years. There is no reliable method to warn future generations about the existence of nuclear waste dumps,” he says.“The nuclear legacy stretches into the far future it poses a risk to environments and human health for periods which extend well beyond our comprehension. Radioactive waste is the achilles heel of the industry,” says Blowers.The US has come closest with a single deep repository. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is a 655-metre deep complex for the disposal of “transuranic” waste, or long-lived intermediate level waste, mostly deriving from military bomb-making.By law, however, all high-level US nuclear waste must go to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which since 1987 has been the designated deep geological repository about 90 miles north-west of Las Vegas.But the site has been met with continued legal, regulatory and constitutional challenges, becoming a political yo-yo since it was identified as a potentially suitable repository. It is fiercely opposed by the Western Shoshone peoples, Nevada state and others.A massive tunnel was excavated in Yucca Mountain but was never licensed and the site is now largely abandoned – to the frustration of the federal government and the nuclear industry, which has raised more than $41bn (£34bn) from a levy on consumer bills to pay for the repository and which must pay for heavy security at their temporary nuclear waste storage sites.“We need a high-level repository. We are holding waste now at about 121 sites across the US,” says Baker Elmore, director of federal programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute.He is supported by the US energy secretary, Rick Perry. “We have a moral and national security obligation to come up with a long-term solution, finding the safest repositories available … we can no longer kick the can down the road,” he said at a Senate hearing in June 2017.Political and community opposition to plans has made progress painfully slow in most countries. In the UK, the government has offered communities money, but has been unable to persuade any local authority to host a permanent deep repository. Massive protests in France and Germany helped fuel the political rise of the Green party and have indefinitely delayed or stopped work on proposed repositories.Only Finland is close to completing a deep repository for high-level waste. In May, work started on an “encapsulation” plant where waste will be packed inside copper canisters that will be transferred into 400- to 450-metre deep underground tunnels. But doubt has been cast on the long-term safety of the canisters.“The problem is intractable,” says Paul Dorfman, founder of the Nuclear Consulting Group, made up of about 120 international academics and independent experts in the fields of radiation waste, nuclear policy and environmental risk.“The bitter reality is that there is no scientifically proven way of disposing of the existential problem of high- and intermediate-level waste. Some countries have built repositories, some plan them.“But given the huge technical uncertainties, if disposal does go ahead and anything goes wrong underground in the next millennia, then future generations risk profound widespread pollution.”Many people now doubt that a satisfactory final repository will ever be found.“Managing the nuclear legacy is not just a technical issue but a social one,” says Blowers.“Given the timescales involved, there is no need to hurry. Society can and should take its time dealing with its nuclear legacy.”• This article originally appeared on Ensia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cfdddfc69bb014d577004a0d51caa0870df6275/182_225_3825_2291/master/3825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e3f1d7ce3ca61556b7b22d37bc8024b","title":"blackrock lost 90bn investing in fossil fuel companies report finds","story":"World’s biggest fund manager urged to invest in clean energy for good of the climate and its investorsBlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has lost an estimated $90bn over the last decade by ignoring the serious financial risk of investing in fossil fuel companies, according to economists.A report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that BlackRock has eroded the value of its $6.5tn funds by betting on oil companies that were falling in value and by missing out on growth in clean energy investments.The report found that BlackRock’s multibillion-dollar investments in the world’s largest oil companies – including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP – were responsible for the bulk of its losses.The fund manager was also stung by the collapse of big US fossil fuel companies, including General Electric, and the coal mining company Peabody.BlackRock faces growing pressure to est from fossil fuels by investors and environmental groups, which have accused the asset manager of dragging its feet on the climate crisis.Tim Buckley, a director at IEEFA and co-author of the report, said BlackRock’s enormous financial heft meant it should take responsibility for leading on the climate emergency.Its combined funds are larger than the economy of Japan, the third largest economy in the world, making it the single largest investor in the global coal industry and one of the top three investors in most big oil companies.“BlackRock wields an enormous amount of influence and shoulders a huge responsibility to the wider community. It has the power to lead globally to address climate risk, yet, to date, it remains a laggard,” Buckley said.The report follows a stark warning from the Bank of England over the “significant risks to the economy and to the financial system” posed by fossil fuel investments.The Bank has estimated that investments worth $20tn could be left “stranded” as governments set more ambitious climate targets.BlackRock has denied responsibility for its fossil fuel investments because the majority of its funds track investment indices which are controlled by third parties, meaning it does not choose inidual companies to back.The IEEFA has used the report to call on BlackRock to propose its own low emissions index benchmark for the passive funds to avoid risking its clients’ investments.It has also called on the fund to appoint a new independent chairman and refresh its 18-strong board, where six members are former executives from companies with close ties to the fossil fuel industry.• This article was amended on 1 August 2019.

Experts give their tips on how to make your outfits last as long as possibleUnless you plan to wear a suit of armour for the rest of your life, there is no way to make your clothes last for ever. You can get close to for ever – if you are prepared to darn. As a society, though, we have become less inclined to make do and mend because the advent of fast fashion has made clothes so affordable that there is no incentive to repair them. In addition, the acceleration of trends – where once there were just two seasons, autumnwinter and springsummer, now there are also resort, cruise and pre-fall collections – means consumers are continually enticed to buy new things. It is estimated that, in the UK, the average lifetime for an item of clothing is 2.2 years.Extending the life of our clothes isn’t just good for our finances, but also benefits the environment: the fashion industry is a major global polluter and human rights abuses are rife in the garment industries of developing nations.Not so long ago, people learned basic sewing skills. The chances are that, if you ask an older friend or relative, they will be able to show you how to patch things. And there is no doubt that, if you want your clothes to last as long as possible, looking after them is the best place to start. But how do you make your clothes last for ever? We asked some experts.It sounds obvious, but if you want your clothes to last, you need to invest in well-made garments in good-quality fabric. Don’t assume that expensive items are best – check for yourself.“The first thing to do when you’re looking at a piece of clothing is turn it inside out and pull at every piece of string you find,” says Orsola de Castro of Fashion Revolution. “When clothes are cheaply made, the seams are often shabby. If it starts to unravel – don’t buy it.”She suggests making sure the seam allowance on a pair of trousers or a skirt is enough to allow you to let them out and the hem is such that you could make the garment longer if you need to. She also advises checking that shirts have a spare button sewn in so if one falls off, you have a replacement.Vintage clothing expert Amy Winston-Hart of Amy’s Vintage says you should hold garments up to the light: “If you can see light coming through the fabric, it’s going to go quickly.”Every garment will eventually wear out after repeated wearing and washing, but the jury is out on which fabrics are the most durable. Some experts prefer the longevity of synthetic fibres such as polyester, while others favour natural fibres such as cotton.Charles Ross, sustainability expert and lecturer at the Royal College of Art says: “I prefer wearing synthetics because I believe they are more durable fibres. If you have two identical T-shirts in cotton or polyester, the cotton will wear out quicker.” The more you wash clothes, the quicker they wear out. De Castro echoes Stella McCartney’s recent advice that we should refrain from over-cleaning clothes. “If something is made from good-quality wool, such as a man’s suit, it’s designed to be brushed clean and not washed,” she says. If you must wash things in a machine, use a low heat, and put delicate fabrics in a laundry bag to reduce tearing.There are plenty of ways to refresh clothes without bunging them in the machine: De Castro suggests spot-cleaning tricky stains, or taking whiffy garments into the bathroom while you shower, to steam them. This will not only help to make your clothes last longer, but is also more environmentally friendly. The average washing machine uses 13,500 gallons of water a year, as much as you drink in your lifetime.Winston-Hart has some nifty tricks for cleaning items without putting them in the machine. “A mixture of lukewarm water and vodka will get rid of smells,” she says. Use three parts vodka and two parts water if something is very stinky, or three parts water and two parts vodka if it only has a light musk. “Stick the mixture in a spray bottle and mist it over. If your clothing still smells bad the next day, give it another spray.” She is also a fan of popping clothes in the freezer, for an overnight refresh. If things are still pongy, hang them out on the line on a breezy day – you will be surprised by how much it can help.None of the experts I speak to are fans of dry cleaning, although they accept it is sometimes necessary. “Dry cleaning doesn’t always clean stuff that well,” says Winston-Hart. “Sometimes it comes back smelling worse – that chemical smell.” By looking after your clothes as much as possible, you can cut back on dry cleaning.An important caveat: items worn close to your skin, particularly underwear and socks, should be washed at an adequate heat. Don’t fling pants in with your dish towels on a 30C wash. “You really don’t want to put bedding, tea towels, gym kit, underwear and socks in at a low temperature,” says environmental health practitioner Dr Lisa Ackerley. All need to be washed at a minimum of 60C.If you are worried about ruining your underwear, wash it at a lower temperature, but add an antibacterial cleanser to the wash.Katrina Hassan, a professional organiser, recommends periodically decluttering your wardrobe. “Get all your clothing in one space – I call it the power of the pile. A lot of people aren’t aware of all the things they own, until they see it.”Decide which items to keep, and check them over for damage. Store things properly – Hassan teaches clients how to fold clothes, then stack them in an upright position, so you can see everything you own at once. “When you store things vertically, you’re less tempted to buy things, and more conscious with your consumerism … you know exactly what you own, and where it’s stored.”Store expensive items in cotton suit bags to prevent moth damage. (If you are on a budget, Winston-Hart suggests using an old single bedsheet, cutting a hole in it for a coathanger to poke through, then sewing up the sides for a DIY suit bag.)To get the most out of your footwear, ensure you look after the leather. “I tend to wear Timberland boots,” Ross tells me, “and every six weeks I wash off the dirt and put on a leather conditioner to keep them going for longer.” (He favours a brand called Nikwax.)It is not just footwear that you can treat to make it last longer: brands such as Polygiene use silver chloride technology, which is antimicrobial, to put a finish on fabrics. “If you have the finish on a polyester T-shirt, you can wear it for five years before it starts smelling,” claims Ross.“I have a deep relationship with my local tailor,” says De Castro. Once a year, she sorts through all her items, and then takes them in for repairs. “They’ll fix niggly things such as dropped hems, change the zips on evening gowns, or take things in and let them out.” When a pair of shoes starts to wear out, consider whether they can be resoled. Ross has worn the same pair of outdoor boots since 1985: the soles have been replaced six times.It is easy to do basic repairs yourself. “If you want to start repairing things and you’re not sure how to go about it, try out on some scrap fabric first,” says repairs expect Tom van Deijnen of the Visible Mending Programme. He recommends watching YouTube videos to learn basic skills, and asking family and friends for help. “In my experience, mothers and grandmothers always come up trumps,” he says.With worn-out jeans, Van Deijnen recommends sewing on patches. “Use a similar colour fabric, in the same weight as the original material – if it’s a woven fabric, patch it with a woven fabric, and if it’s a jersey fabric, use a jersey patch.”A common mistake people make when darning knitwear is to do it too tightly. “It doesn’t leave room for shrinking – sometimes threads can shrink when they are new. And if you pull the hole too tight, it can also cause a pucker, which creates tension in the fabric, meaning it will rip again.”Van Deijnen explains the best way to sew on a button. “Thread the needle, make some stitches in the fabric, then attach the button and sew it on. Do it a good few times. When you’ve finished, tug on the thread. If it comes loose, you didn’t do a good job.”Not every item can be repaired. “I’m quite adventurous and I’ll always give things ago, but sometimes things can be completely beyond repair,” says Van Deijnen. He recently had to bin a knitted tie that was riddled with moth eggs. The fabric disintegrated in his hands when he touched it, so he had no choice.When something can’t be fixed, think of alternate uses for it. “Everything can have another function at the end of its life,” says De Castro. She cuts up old swimsuits to use as hair ties (old tights are also good for this). And old T-shirts make the best cleaning rags.Donate intelligently. “Charity shops are brimming with our clothes,” says De Castro, “so you should only donate to charity what you think will sell. Otherwise, you’re dumping your problem on another organisation.” If you know it won’t sell – perhaps because it is old gym kit – take it to a textile-recycling bank where it can be turned into a new item. (Trainers can be recycled at branches of Runners Need.) The Love Your Clothes campaign has a textile bank locator, along with other resources, on its website.If you want your clothes to last, it can make sense to buy vintage: things made before 1980 tend to be made to a higher standard than modern items. “Even cheaply made 1970s trousers, if you turn them inside out, will resemble couture now,” says De Castro. But there is also a lot of factory-made fake vintage out there. How to tell? Look at details such as zips – is there a hook and eye to keep the zip in place? If not, it may be a fake. Other signs include 40s-style dresses with elasticated fabric – stretchy material wasn’t around then.Look after your vintage. “Armpit shields are really good,” says Winston-Hart. “They’re just cotton half-moons you attach with safety pins to your clothing under the armpits. You remove the pins and wash the pads themselves – which saves you having to wash the garment all the time.”Wearing a slip under a skirt means you don’t have to clean the skirt as often, as it is not touching your skin, cutting down on dry cleaning costs and reducing wear. If the slip is made out of silk, it will also help to regulate your body temperature. There are so many places to find secondhand treasures, whether it is a clothes swap with friends, charity shops or car boot sales. If you are a vintage aficionado, Winston-Hart recommends her favourite stores: Apple Tree Vintage, 1940s Style For You, Scarlet Rage Vintage, Blackout Vintage Fashion and Hunky Dory Vintage. (Many have online stores.) If vintage isn’t your thing, find more contemporary secondhand pieces on eBay or Depop. Sometimes, buying new clothes can be a sustainable choice – Hiut Denim will do free repairs on your jeans for life.It is not just about buying vintage or secondhand clothes. Ross talks about “emotional durability,” or the attachment to our most beloved clothes, because the most sustainable item in your wardrobe isn’t always the one that is ethically produced from non-polluting fabrics. It is the one you love, and will wear your whole life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358beb9e0da3c450225cb2a112c8d7211dc5c3b5/0_91_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=836c5be6bbf2a043595f0d2fb2a3d764","title":"balance not symmetry review biffy clyro art school bria vinaite simon neil","story":"Bria Vinaite again proves her star quality in this earnest coming-of-age film co-scripted by Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil There are moments you may have to bite your lip very hard to stifle harrumphs of exasperation watching this drifty on-the-the-fly Glaswegian indie drama about a young woman grieving for her dad and struggling to finish her art-school graduation show. Written by director Jamie Adams in collaboration with Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil – whose band provides the soundtrack – the whole thing has the tentative, incomplete feel of an improv actors’ project.BlacKkKlansman’s Laura Harrier gives a blank performance as Caitlin, an American-Scot who grew up in New York but is studying art in Glasgow. The film begins with her dad’s funeral, after which Caitlin hastily heads back to college where she shares a flat with her fun-loving best friend Hannah (luminous Bria Vinaite from The Florida Project). In the studio, Caitlin is trying to find her voice as an artist, so naturally there are plenty of scenes in which she stares frowningly at a blank canvas. Worse are the deep conversations about art that may make you feel like you’re trapped in the corner of a party at 2am by a guy with merlot-stained teeth: “I don’t want it to look like art. I want you to walk past it and feel something raw.”Adams and Neil have spoken to the  about losing their mothers in their 20s and channelling that loss into the film, though you may wonder why they projected their shared experience on to a female character. Still, there some memorable scene here – one as a Turner-winning artist arrives to examine the students’ show the ferocity of her gaze is electric. And Vinaite is such a natural and authentic screen presence. She deserves a lead role soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddce67f7984ea3c223851eeced333cbcda3651db/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d262f3b6a1ced38e2d55bcfb1db3d745","title":"if its monday it must be moussaka how meal planning can save you stress and money","story":"Tired of scrabbling around for last-minute dinner ideas and throwing away unused perishables? These 10 tips will get you properly organisedKate Turner is aware that the chalkboard meal-planner in her Sussex kitchen can bewilder visitors. “Friends come round and go: ‘Wow, my God!’,” says the author of My Zero-Waste Kitchen. That breakfast, lunch and dinner wallchart (Wednesday: porridge Dad’s salad pilaf Thursday: cereal, tuna sandwiches spinach pie) may look overwhelming, but Turner insists: “It’s not scary. Not having to think about what you’re cooking is liberating. It saves money, time and stress.”Meal-planning has a way to go before it becomes mainstream, but it has long been a hit with weight-loss experts and wellness gurus, and the growing desire to cut food waste has led to a new wave of interest.True, using every scrap of your shopping across purposefully planned meals is a habit you have to develop. But whether you cook complex dishes from scratch every night or are more of a pasta-and-sauce person, to Turner, planning makes unbeatable ecological and financial sense. “If you’re wasting food, you’re wasting money,” she says. “I’m really keen this isn’t seen as a middle-class hobby. It’s a money-saver for anybody.”But where do you start? Here are 10 tips from experts.Whether you use a Google doc, a spreadsheet, a magnetic fridge whiteboard or a simple notepad, you first need to setup a seven-day planner that you can easily edit – one week being a reasonable timeframe in which to use fresh ingredients before they spoil. If you prefer, there are apps (Yummly, SideChef, Smart Recipes) that can help you pick meals and recipes and generate shopping lists.Make it enjoyable, urges the chef Miguel Barclay, the author of One Pound Meals: “You don’t have to start on Monday. Start on Friday night’s curry if that’s the meal you look forward to most, or Sunday roast if that’s non-negotiable. If cooking’s not exciting, in six months you’ll be back on takeaways.”A meal plan should not dictate your life. As you plan, jot down what you are doing each day (meeting mates for a drink after work, picking the kids up late from football) and think about what time you have to cook, if at all. Working across seven days gives you flexibility. You can stay late in the pub or order a takeaway on a whim without creating disastrous waste. “I can’t be rigid about it,” says Turner. “Work and family life don’t allow for that. If meals get shunted around the week, that’s fine.”Food offers infinite possibilities. To write a quick meal plan, you need to narrow them down, establishing a framework that works for you. You might start by choosing three meats a week, from a whole chicken to a pack of bacon, then select recipes that use those meats across two or three different meals. Or you might be led by leftovers: select three main meals you love, then choose recipes for the other days that use up any raw or cooked remants. Cooking dinner plus an extra portion for tomorrow’s lunch is a third way to minimise cost and waste.In choosing meats, think about leftovers. You can use cold roast beef as pie filling or in a sandwich but, arguably, it’s less user-friendly than leftover roast chicken, which can be used shredded in stir-fries, or in soups and salads.Another useful discipline is to stick to one type of cuisine each week (Indian, Italian, Chinese), so you don’t end up having to use leftover pak choi in a lasagne. “If you do Thai on Tuesday and pizza on Wednesday, you’ll have waste,” says Rachel Beckwith, the family editor at BBC Good Food magazine.“Whatever I’ve got left over from my last dish, I use as the first piece of the jigsaw for my next recipe,” says Barclay, a pro chef with a vast mental Rolodex of ideas to draw on. But where should the rest of us look for inspiration? “Type ‘leftover chicken recipes’ into Google,” he suggests. “There’s the 10 best leftover chicken recipes, pictures, everything. There is no secret to finding recipes: just type it into Google, pick one, move on. Google are trying to make driverless cars. Do you not think they moved on to that after they sorted out the leftover-chicken recipes?”It needn’t be huge, but put together a store cupboard of basic carbs (dried pasta, lentils, rice) flavourings (soy sauce, stock cubes, dry herbs, spices) tins (pulses, tomatoes, tuna) and frozen veg, such as peas. You will be ready to tackle most planned meals.Browsing online can be helpful by showing you pack sizes as you write your meal plan, but deliveries can often include short-dated products or already ripe fruit that you need to speed-eat, disrupting that plan. Instead, shop in person, ideally somewhere you can weigh out the ingredients you need. Write your shopping list in a rough date order as a reminder to buy items with a longer sell-by date that you plan to use later in the week.Choose any deals wisely, warns Beckwith. “It’s a false economy if you buy something two-for-one and it goes bad in the fridge. Supermarkets want you to pay for that wastage.”“Chorizo and bacon are perfect examples,” says Barclay. “A little goes a long way, whereas something like steak is very poor value.”Use prime ingredients with a short shelf-life early, as through the week you will accumulate leftovers that require retooling – into a sausage, tomato and cabbage chilli pasta, say, or a one-pot stew. “I use more curries and bolognese-type recipes at the end of the week, where it doesn’t show if a courgette’s gone past its best. It’s more forgiving, especially things with spices,” says Beckwith.A well-organised freezer is the bedrock of minimal-waste meal planning. It allows you to save most leftovers or tired, withering items (bananas, pureed fruits, chopped onions and garlic, herbs blitzed into a pesto etc), and maintain a stash of meals to fall back on when you are too busy or cannot be mithered cooking.How you store things is a matter of taste and budget (reusable zip-lock bags, Tupperware, recycled plastic takeaway containers), but clearly label everything, including the date frozen and ideal use-by date, which will usually be within three months.“An hour or two of prep each weekend (making meals for the freezer or, perhaps cooking mince that you can turn into a shepherd’s pie) will make it far more likely that you stick to your meal plan during the week.A warning: test any recipes before you XXL them. Making a huge vat of revolting veggie chilli for the freezer that you reluctantly trudge through over several weeks will definitely erode your enthusiasm for this whole meal-planning malarkey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78df69c7f317fd91f9aafad071494978d384d7ed/101_489_6272_3763/master/6272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c39c99b669a16e20eda7bc92b9aece4","title":"kim joys recipe for fruit and vegetable cookies","story":"Potato starch gives these miniature cookies a wonderful texture.

Thankfully no one seemed to mind that I was more of a noviceBy When Saturday Comes, part of the  Sport NetworkI’m standing on the touchline, though it’s more of a contorted crouch, as I try to shield myself from the wind whipping thousands of tiny, icy ball-bearings straight into my face. I am sodden and cannot imagine how I could possibly ever be wetter or colder. I’m holding a linesman’s flag but can’t raise it as whenever I try the flag falls off. I can’t really follow what’s going on anyway as the path of the hail is from the far side of the pitch to my side. I’m not even a linesman. I’m just filling in, as one of the substitutes tends to do. One of the other subs has already gone home. Another is sheltering elsewhere, back in the dressing room I think. I’m not entirely sure if I’m even going to get on the pitch today. It is May.I didn’t picture the last day of the season being like this. A year ago, I didn’t think I’d play football again. I was hurtling through my late-30s with 40 on the horizon. There were other, more important things to do on a Saturday afternoon. And with a well-cultivated dad bod I wasn’t exactly in the right shape to lace up my boots anyway.While I had watched more than my fair share of football over the years, I’d not really played much before. I’d played at school, then dabbled in five- and seven-a-side football in my 20s. But proper, competitive 11-a-side seemed an opportunity long gone. Busy, unfit and frankly not very good at football, my prospects looked dim. But there was still a nagging feeling that I’d missed out. I should have had a go.I then saw a post from my local non-League team, Phoenix Sports, announcing they were re-forming their veterans’ side, and were looking for new players. As much as I fulfilled the age requirements for veterans’ football, I wasn’t sure I strictly met the remit of a “veteran”. With my lack of real competitive experience, there was a risk that I’d be the equivalent of one of those blokes who dabbled in the TA for a couple of years and then pretends he has had a proper army career. I was basically a bit of a fraud. But I still wanted to play.Pre-season was rough. I was pretty sure the warm-up had lasted an hour but when I checked the time it had only been 10 minutes. Physically I was a mess. I noticed a few around me in a similar state, but at least they had some technique to fall back on. I didn’t even have that.Then, unfortunately, my wife fell ill, so I decided to take a break from it all, before it had even really started. It was a really tough time but football gave me an escape, even when I couldn’t play it. When I was feeling down it gave me something to look forward to. When I just wanted to stuff myself with beer and cake it gave me the motivation to lose some weight and get fitter instead. And all of that helped me feel a bit more level-headed and able to cope with the kind of stuff life throws at you from time to time.By the autumn my wife was on the mend and with her full encouragement I was able to pick up from where I left off. To my amazement, despite my absolute lack of fitness, experience or skill, the team were happy for me to come along and play.I’m sure there was some middle-aged delayed-adolescent wish fulfilment here, but going into a dressing room, putting on a proper kit and then taking part in a proper match with a proper referee – where the result even ends up on the FA website – was exhilarating. Coming on as a sub for 10 minutes felt like a genuine achievement. Even though I was rubbish.And I kept playing and kept learning. I’ve played with and against players who have played at a decent level, and those who could have done so had a few more things gone their way. I’ve learned a hard-fought one-nil win is much more satisfying than routing your opposition, that some players really do light up a fag at half-time and that some people are mad enough to give up their Saturdays not playing, but refereeing a load of angry middle-aged men. I haven’t quite discovered what a foul throw actually is though. That mystery remains.I have had first-hand experience of just how hard it is to play at wing-back, but how a bit more fitness and a lot more positional awareness goes a long way. I’ve played up front too, and gone from missing the ball and accidentally kicking the goalkeeper in the head to actually scoring a goal (from a yard out, but they all count, right?). I’ve got in better shape, mainly because I don’t really enjoy being yelled at by our captain for not putting the effort in – that even if I can’t play very well that shouldn’t stop me running down every ball. He had a point.I’m still no world-beater, but now I have a bit of a better idea about why. And the nicknames I’ve been given probably help with that analysis too – Steve the Toe in honour of how I strike the ball (or not) and The Hoff in honour of my rather laboured, exaggerated running style. I didn’t mind that I was nearly always on the bench, generally helping out running the line, or running off to collect loose footballs, or handing out the waters. As much as I’m clearly that weird bloke who turned up in pre-season and really couldn’t play, I’m now part of a team.And that’s why I was there, that afternoon in May, shielding myself from hail, shivering, grappling with a broken linesman’s flag. Life is hard and around the time you become eligible for veterans’ football it seems to get harder. Football gives you a break. It gives you something else to think about from Monday to Friday. And on a Saturday it takes you away completely, so for a couple of hours all that matters is beating the team in front of you. I’m still no veteran but, with one season under my belt, I’m a tiny bit closer to becoming one.This article appeared first in When Saturday Comes, where it won the annual David Wangerin writing competition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f553c39901a8c3bcc99f1206ef24bdef3943f83/0_111_5656_3394/master/5656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40990f80697a414bc1fa0a910127dc8d","title":"were not afraid to lead myanmar displaced find a new voice","story":"Fearful for their safety, many of the 241,000 people forced from their homes by conflict in Myanmar are reluctant to go back. Now campaigners are mobilising to resist organised returnsBawk Nu Awng hasn’t been home since 2011. All three of the villages where she spent her childhood have been destroyed.“War hit wherever my family lived,” she said. “I feel like it is my responsibility to engage in all matters related to peace.”Now aged 21, Bawk Nu Awng, from Kachin in Myanmar, has emerged as a spokesperson among youth displaced by conflict.When Aung San Suu Kyi took power in 2016, her party, the National League for Democracy, pledged to prioritise ending conflict in Myanmar. Yet the country’s various ethnic groups continue to fight for increased federal autonomy.In Rakhine state, conflict is escalating between Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, and the rebel Arakan Army. Nationwide, an estimated 241,000 people like Bawk Nu Awng remain in camps, including more than 97,000 in Kachin state.Camps for internally displaced people are the most visible evidence of Myanmar’s ongoing strife. With elections coming up next year, political momentum to send displaced people home has accelerated.Kachin, which shares a border with China’s Yunnan province, is a strategic area for China’s belt and road initiative, a global development strategy that includes a multi-billion pound China-Myanmar economic corridor. In March, Yunnan officials met with the influential Kachin Baptist Convention support for returns and a peace agreement was encouraged, with the Chinese contingent suggesting stability could bring investment and development.In December, the Tatmadaw offered a short unilateral ceasefire, since extended to 31 August, to three ethnic armies in northern Myanmar including the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).Shortly after the announcement, the first organised returns occurred, the Tatmadaw accompanying a group of displaced people back to the village of Nam San Yang, despite having deactivated land mines only weeks before. Talks have since been held between the government and the Kachin Humanitarian Concern Committee, a group headed by church leaders that mediates on returns. No displaced people have been included in the meetings.In early June, longtime activist Lum Zawng, 30, brought together 43 young displaced people in the state capital, Myitkyina, to discuss their perspective on returns. Nawng Lat, 31, who was at that meeting alongside Bawk Nu Awng, said: “We urgently had to form a group to think deeply about our returns and raise our voice.”The group developed a statement, published on Facebook, stating that returns should only happen when safety and dignity could be assured, and when people have been consulted and are free to decide when to return without pressure or force being applied. It also stated that displaced people should not be used for political, economic or social advantage.Nawng Lat, who is from Nam San Yang village, was not part of the group that returned. He is eager to go home, but only when conditions are right. When fighting resumed eight years ago, he never imagined living in a camp for so long. “My first thought was that the war would last a few months,” he says. “After about three years, everything became unsure. I wondered why it was happening, why we couldn’t go back.”Now he is among more than 38,000 displaced people living in areas outside the government’s jurisdiction. With limited access to higher education and jobs, many young people leave for China in search of livelihoods, where they are vulnerable to trafficking and abuse.“The longer we stay in IDP camps, the more problems we face,” he says. “I don’t want returns to happen under pressure. I’m not saying we don’t want to go back actually, we are eager to back as soon as possible. It’s been eight years since we have been displaced and we have lost so many things related to our education and development. We will only return after we have a security guarantee.”Bawk Nu Awng wants a guarantee that landmines have been cleared: “Currently, it is like they want us to stay in a house that is not fully built. When it rains, it will leak. Only after they have fully built the house should we stay in it. There needs to be trust. In June, the activists staged a public drama performance to commemorate the war’s eighth anniversary. Pau Lu and fellow organiser Seng Nu Pan informed the authorities yet, moments before the performance, police turned up claiming that extra permissions were required. The event was moved and went ahead, but Pau Lu and Seng Nu Pan were charged with holding an unauthorised protest. They now face a maximum three-month prison sentence in the ongoing case.The incident is one of several in which activists have faced criminal charges. In April last yea,r Lum Zawng and fellow activists Zau Jat and Nang Pu received a six-month prison sentence for defaming the Tatmadaw by leading a demonstration demanding safe passage and humanitarian access to 2,000 villagers trapped during a period of escalated fighting.Bawk Nu Awng says fear makes people reluctant to act: “Some are afraid of engaging in politics … My parents don’t want me to participate because they are afraid I will get shot or arrested.”Released during an annual presidential amnesty, Lum Zawng said arresting activists serves as a “psychological threat”.Seng Nu Pan says arrests only “push us to do more”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b873400d3cdf2431628f54168fb930354beb239d/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e219c598efe027c1775e23250f450b7e","title":"severn bridge services named as worst on englands motorways","story":"Visitors criticise ‘grim’ toilets and fly-infested restaurant at services on M48 near BristolA motorway service station overlooking the Severn Bridge has been named the worst in England after visitors criticised its unwelcoming 1960s exterior and “grim and dismal” toilets.Norton Canes (Roadchef) services between junctions 6 and 7 of the M6 toll road in Staffordshire was rated the best for the second year running in the survey by the independent watchdog Transport Focus.The results are published on Thursday in the watchdog’s third annual Motorway Services User Survey, in which 11,600 drivers were questioned on issues such as the state of the buildings and toilets, food and drink, and staff friendliness.Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: “Motorway users tell us they have a good experience when visiting service areas, but it’s clear that many do not feel the experience is good value for money. They want pleasant, well-maintained facilities with good-quality food choices.“Motorway services continue to play an important safety role providing drivers with the opportunity to take a break. Drivers confirm they feel less stressed and are more alert after stopping at motorway services.”Severn View services, owned by operator Moto, is one of the smallest motorway services in the network. It has attracted a swathe of critical Google reviews one user claimed it was “tired and overdue a refit” and another that the restaurant had “flies buzzing about”. Other reviewers described the toilet facilities as “grim”, “falling apart” and “dismal”.“However, we will be redoubling our efforts in the year ahead to improve the services on offer at Severn View and expect to see a similar significant improvement to the one we achieved at Thurrock last year.”Luke Bosdet, an AA spokesman, said: “Motorway service areas have long faced an image battle with the motorists that use them. On one hand, they are a godsend for toilet breaks, relief from monotonous hours on the motorway and the chance for a nap or wake-up coffee. On the other, the sheer numbers that use them during the summer and the strain that can put on the service area facilities can leave drivers with a poor impression.”Top five (Name and location, operator and customer satisfaction rating)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, played down the likelihood of it last week.On Wednesday, the government announced a £2.1bn funding boost for no-deal Brexit preparations to pay for the stockpiling of medicines, border officials and a major public awareness campaign about likely disruption. It was a move designed to show Brussels the UK is ready and willing to leave the bloc without a deal.The chancellor usually gives the budget later in November or December. But the  has reported that Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s senior adviser, told aides to prepare for a budget in early October, just weeks before the scheduled Brexit date.Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank, has said a pre-Brexit budget would be an “extraordinarily bad idea”, coming before the government could judge what support the economy needed once it had left the EU.Sunak told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We will have a fiscal event in the autumn because we will need to have a spending review, and a spending review is what sets out all department spending plans for the next financial period.”When pushed on whether this would take place before Brexit, Sunak said: “We’d like to give people certainty as soon as possible. Obviously we’re working, the chancellor and me, we’ve been in these jobs a few days, we’re working very hard on figuring the exact timing of that. Hopefully we’ll have something to say on that reasonably soon.”Sunak also defended the huge no-deal Brexit expenditure announced on Wednesday.“A lot of the money we’re spending is going to go on things we would need to spend anyway because we’re leaving the European Union, that means we’re going to be leaving the single market and the customs union. So of course that does mean changes to how we trade with Europe. So investments in things like our ports and our border infrastructure, our systems, getting companies ready for those changes. All of that is money that we should be spending anyway on those new arrangements,” Sunak said.Johnson\u0026nbsptold the Treasury select committee\u0026nbspin March 2016:\u0026nbsp“Our relationship with the EU is already very well developed. It doesn’t seem to me to be very hard … to do a free trade deal very rapidly indeed.”Speaking at a Vote Leave event\u0026nbspin March 2016, Johnson said:\u0026nbsp“I put it to you, all those who say that there would be barriers to trade with Europe if we were to do a Brexit, do you seriously believe that they would put up tariffs against UK produce of any kind, when they know how much they want to sell us their cake, their champagne, their cheese from France? It is totally and utterly absurd.”Johnson, then foreign secretary,\u0026nbsptold the House of Commons in July 2017:“There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.”Two months before the June 2016 referendum vote,\u0026nbspRaab told Andrew Neil on BBC Sunday Politics:\u0026nbsp“We’re very well placed, and mutual self-interest suggests we’d cut a very good deal and it’s certainly not in the European’s interests to erect trade barriers.”During an appearance\u0026nbspon the BBC’s Daily Politics in April 2016, Raab added: “The idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly.”In\u0026nbspApril 2016, Michael Gove said the UK would have the best of both worlds. “Outside the EU, we would still benefit from the free trade zone which stretches from Iceland to the Russian border,” he said. “But we wouldn’t have all the EU regulations which cost our economy £600m every week.”After the referendum, in July 2017, the then-international trade secretary\u0026nbspLiam Fox said: “The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.”“At some point we will be leaving the European Union, hopefully by the end of October is our clear desires, so at some point we would have to do that campaign to get traders ready for the changes they’ll have to do.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, described the spending as an “appalling waste” of taxpayers’ money that could have been spent on schools, hospitals and people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f07e58ca548e7fa09e3531a0bb07174d194a741d/0_16_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b8f5baded07fe1272325641c45b6dc2","title":"the view from brecon and radnorshire voters byelection","story":"Voters share their opinions in Welsh town where Lib Dems and Brexit party hope to steal Tory votesGreg Collins, a 53-year-old care worker, waved off the bright turquoise open-topped Brexit party bus as it began one of its final grand tours of the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency and declared that Nigel Farage’s candidate would be getting his vote.“I was a Labour supporter for a long time but they have let us down – Tony Blair lied over the Iraq war,” said Collins. “The Lib Dems helped bring austerity on us so I won’t have anything to do with them.”And the Tories? Collins, it turns out, was one of 150 or so people who stood in the drizzle outside Brecon Guildhall this week hoping to get a glimpse of the new prime minister when he visited mid-Wales before Thursday’s byelection. But the crowd was left disappointed, with Boris Johnson only making a flying visit to an enterprise park on the fringe of the town rather than meeting and greeting the voters.“I was keen to see him and if I’d have had the chance I’d have liked to speak to him,” said Collins. “I waited there for nearly two hours and he didn’t turn up. The common man gets stiffed all the time. I’m voting for Mr Farage this time and if he turns out to be a liar, I won’t vote again.”In truth, the byelection is just about the last thing Johnson needs. It is his first major test as prime minister and if, as is widely expected, the Liberal Democrats win, his working majority in the Commons will be reduced to just one.The Brexit party candidate, Des Parkinson, a former police chief superintendent, called the Tory decision to put Davies up again as arrogant. “He’s doing the Tory cause here no good.”Activists for the Brexit party have flooded in. Diana Coad, a Tory defector from Berkshire, was running the buzzing Brecon campaign office on Wednesday – and making sure those getting on the bus had been to the toilet before departure. “They’re a smashing bunch. They come from all over,” she said.One absentee is Farage. The Brexit party MEP Nathan Gill explained that the leader was spending time in the US “with his friend Donald Trump” and also planning a much larger campaign.“We’re in general election mode,” said Gill. “He’s got to make sure we’re fighting fit and ready for the big one.” Gill said he thought there would be a general election on 24 October. “Put a fiver on it.”In 2017 the results were as follows:\u0026nbspDespite the guilty verdict in court and the successful recall petition, Conservatives\u0027 Chris Davies is standing again and will hope to retain the seat. If he doesn\u0027t, new prime minister Boris Johnson will find his tiny working majority in parliament further diminished.Jane Dodds is standing for the Liberal Democrats, and Tom Davies is standing for Labour. The Brexit Party will be represented by Des Parkinson.In a move intended to to avoid splitting the \u0027remain\u0027 vote in the constituency, the Green party and Plaid Cymru have decided not to stand candidates, urging their supporters to back Dodds and the Lib Dems.Lady Lily Pink is standing for the Monster Raving Loony party.Of course, not everyone was impressed by the bright blue bus and the Brexit party bluster.Les, a sheep farmer, was taking his ease in the sunshine when the vehicle drove through Brecon town centre. “They’re the sort that are here today, gone tomorrow,” he said.Agriculture has been at the centre of this campaign with warnings of heartache for sheep farmers and even civil unrest if the UK leaves the EU with no deal.Les voted for remain and will be backing the Lib Dems at the byelection. “Boris is thinking he can get a deal. I very much doubt he can. With him in charge we’re heading for a no deal. That’s a bad job for us. All the work we’ve done will be undone. It will mean a big adjustment.”Three doors along from the Brexit party office, the Lib Dem campaign HQ was even more lively. The Lib Dems held this seat between 1997 and 2015 and believe they will win it back.Candy Piercy had just arrived from Buckinghamshire to help the party’s candidate Jane Dodds. A veteran of byelections up and down the country, Piercy said she was shocked the Tories had chosen Davies to stand again. “I wonder if it’s because they want to blame him for losing it,” she said.Kirsty Williams, the Lib Dem Welsh assembly member for Brecon and Radnorshire, said the campaign was not just about farming and Brexit.“But when they are not talking about Brexit they want to talk about public expenditure, about infrastructure, austerity and hyper-local issues such as is the library going to survive.”Williams criticised Johnson’s no-show in the town centre – a stark contrast to the efforts of the new Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who has visited four times.“Quite clearly this was a very stage-managed visit with extensive care taken to avoid scrutiny,” she said. “In a constituency particularly vulnerable to no-deal Brexit, local people are right to expect the Conservatives to explain why they are pursuing it. The fact they shied away speaks volumes.”Davies, however, said he did not regret standing. “The support I’ve had from the people of Brecon and Radnorshire has been immense,” he said. “These aren’t just constituents. They are former clients, friends, family. It was they that encouraged me to stand again.”He insisted he had not meant to commit an offence over his expenses – which concerned the submitting of fake invoices for nine framed landscape photographs, costing £700, to decorate his office in the town of Builth Wells.“I regret making a mistake, clearly. A mistake was made in my paperwork. This was a legitimate expense. There was no financial gain. It was a pure mistake and I’ve paid a heavy price.”Asked whether he was sorry for causing his new leaders such a headache, he said: “There are many things the prime minister will have a headache over. I’m sure this byelection is one of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6267b913b2b60563707fbb38990e6e5633c7c97c/0_288_5048_3028/master/5048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66c40d040dd651b596e3d2b3f4b0df3","title":"they could end up kingmakers again readers on future liberal democrats","story":"Readers share their hopes for a new movement in the UK, while others can’t forget the party’s part in austerity in the coalitionA week on from Jo Swinson’s election as leader of the Liberal Democrats, we asked readers to share their views on the future of the party.People from across the UK told of their hopes for the party under its new leader and the strength of the Lib Dems’ clear anti-Brexit line. While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

There are, however, three slight issues with this. First, it’s not clear how well the strategy works, second, the word actually means something slightly different, and that definition is not particularly flattering.Let’s start with how Boris Johnson’s team appear to view it: as, essentially, an economic credo, to be laid down in the autumn budget, of spending heavily on infrastructure while also cutting taxes.As such it combines fiscal stimulus – putting “rocket boosters” under the economy, as No 10 insiders have reportedly briefed – with a more nebulous attempt to gee up confidence in growth, similar to Johnson’s simultaneous attempt to increase optimism about Brexit.Economically, this sounds like a philosophy with a longer and fairly chequered history: Reaganomics.As US president, Ronald Reagan boosted growth with his combination of tax cuts and extra spending, but also saw public debt soar, and inequality widen, as the promised “trickle down” effect of tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy failed to materialise.The secondary element of the Johnson definition – talking up the economy – is at least closer to the accepted historical use of the word, though again the connotations are by no means always a compliment.In North American usage, “boosterism” is the heavy promotion of a place, or person, with a hint of hyperbole, even huckster-ish tendencies.In America it has been most associated with efforts to support small towns through new buildings, infrastructure or gimmicks. Historically it has been linked to attempts to inflate local property prices, perhaps excessively so, tempting unwary investors.These days it is often associated more with breakneck gentrification, a similar process except the new money, gimmicks and suddenly unaffordable property prices are intended to revitalise a once-prosperous area.Recent pre-Johnson uses of the term by the  have tended to focus on this sense of talking up a place or project perhaps beyond the realms of realism. One 2017 editorial managed to have its linguistic cake and eat it by using boosterism to describe Elon Musk’s over-promotion of his planned space projects.Perhaps the most famous, and fundamental, use of the word is less favourable still – in Babbitt, the popular if idiosyncratic 1922 satirical novel by writer and social reformer Sinclair Lewis.George F Babbitt, the eponymous protagonist, is a real estate salesman in the fictional midwest city of Zenith, where trade is bolstered by the city’s creed of boosterism – talking up its virtues to increase local fortunes. Such was the novel’s initial influence that for a period “Babbittry” was used as US slang for a sort of over-inflated sales pitch.Babbitt proudly wears a badge proclaiming his membership of the local Boosters’ Club, a sort of masonic lodge meets chamber of commerce, around which much of his business and social life revolved.The novel describes his disaffection with this cosy, bourgeois life. Babbitt initially preaches conventional morality, but then begins an affair.Eventually, and this could, arguably, be the point where the modern connection is broken, he has a crisis of confidence and resumes his conventional life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1e451b584a678b6a7d2590f429579188fba7f6/0_140_6075_3645/master/6075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889f6871123ba879eb2597c89d67ce22","title":"alcohol minimum price law obeyed across scotland says report","story":"Scotland’s pioneering policy of minimum pricing for alcohol has been successfully implemented, with compliance high across the country, according to the first report to evaluate its effectiveness.The study by NHS Health Scotland also welcomed the policy as having “the potential to improve Scotland’s relationship with alcohol and reduce the harm it causes”.Minimum unit pricing (MUP) for all alcoholic drinks, set at 50p per unit, was eventually introduced in May last year after repeated attempts led by the Scotch Whisky Association to derail the proposals in the courts.Scottish ministers believe the policy, which means a standard bottle of whisky (700ml) must cost at least £14 and a 2 litre bottle of cider £5, will save approximately 400 lives over the next five years and lead to about 8,000 fewer alcohol-related hospital admissions.The report, which collated the experiences of police and local authority officials with a licensing remit, found that there had been no increase in illegal and unlicensed alcohol activity since the law was introduced, while pubs, clubs and restaurants, which typically charge higher prices for drink than off-licences and supermarkets, had been largely unaffected by the policy.One of the greatest risks of non-compliance was found along the border with England, where some retailers remained uncertain which licensing regime they fell under.Officials working in border areas also reported they were aware of people obtaining their home delivery shopping from stores located in England, because MUP would not apply to these online purchases.The report noted “anecdotal” evidence of people going to stores in England to stock up on alcohol for themselves or their friends.The report also identified smaller retailers using the policy as an excuse to increase their prices on alcohol products not affected by MUP. One licensing standards officer said: “A lot of them have used the minimum unit price as an opportunity to just creep up all of their alcohol prices and blame it on Nicola Sturgeon.”Officials reported the retailers were already describing some changes in purchasing habits: “For example, some customers who were previously known to buy large-volume, high-strength ciders, and were thought to no longer be able to afford them under the price increase of MUP, were now, reportedly, buying bottles of wine.”Elinor Dickie, a public health intelligence adviser at NHS Health Scotland and author of the report, said that this first study on implementation represented a crucial foundation for the policy’s evaluation.“Minimum unit pricing has the potential to improve Scotland’s relationship with alcohol and reduce the harm it causes. But MUP in the form we have it in Scotland hasn’t been put it in place anywhere before. That’s why it’s so important to gather evidence of its impact through a robust and comprehensive evaluation.”Similar legislation is to come into force next year in Wales. while ministers in Northern Ireland were considering minimum pricing before the Stormont power-sharing government collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55876562bfd0917de37d2cfc323935d75a567962/0_133_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=989496430c59f44d93e8809000e0e326","title":"andy jamie murray doubles citi open","story":"Andy Murray and brother Jamie battled past French pair Nicolas Mahut and Edouard Roger-Vasselin at the Citi Open in Washington.The former world No 1 has so far been restricted to doubles action since returning to the game following his hip resurfacing operation in January, and played in the mixed event alongside Serena Williams at Wimbledon.Murray, who has suggested his singles return may be closer than he originally thought, produced a composed display alongside his brother as they progressed to the quarter-finals with a gutsy 6-4 6-7 (7) 10-5 win in a tie-break decider.A return to the hard courts in August appears in Murray’s sights, but that could yet be delayed until after the US Open.The 32-year-old’s last grand slam appearance was at the Australian Open in Melbourne, where he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round.Pairing with his brother was not a new partnership, the Murrays having played together at the Rio Olympics and also formed a prolific partnership during Great Britain’s 2015 Davis Cup victory.Jamie Murray, meanwhile, was looking to defending his ATP Tour title won in Washington last year with Bruno Soares.The opening set went with serve before the Murray’s pressure told in game 10 to gain a crucial break.The match remained a tight affair as the French pair held to force a tie-break.The Murrays saw two match point chances missed having been 6-4 up, the second with a wide return from the former world number one.Some more fine returns from the British duo saw another opportunity to break for the match, but again the Frenchmen responded to level at 7-7 before closing out to force a 10-point tie-break decider.Mahut and Roger-Vasselin then appeared to be in control after moving 5-3 ahead, only for the Murray brothers to respond magnificently and lead 8-5.Jamie Murray then served for the match, with Andy’s crosscourt forehand setting up another opportunity to take a hard-earned victory, which was secured when the return went into the net."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c0862ca609426004e445d1409d0a70c5e02d99/419_321_5053_3032/master/5053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dead5628d406ef8cb8d9b8f1573681c7","title":"england v australia ashes 2019 first test day one live cricket","story":"6th over: Australia 12-1 (Bancroft 4, Khawaja 4) Nice. Bancroft is off the mark with a defensive stroke that’s timed so well that it runs away for four down to long-off. A leg-bye is added when Broad misses his line. One to finish and Khawaja is off the mark with a delightful clip through midwicket, making two fours from the over.“Hi Adam.” Hi, Harry O’Brien. “During Edgbaston Ashes 2005, I was seated next to a huge swathe of Aussie fans, so the closest bar was a sea of yellow every day. The nearest loo was an Aussie stronghold too. During Australia’s 2nd innings when things were getting tense, Gilchrist came to the crease as I headed to the loo, keeping in touch with the goings on through my ear-piece and transistor radio. Surrounded by 30 or 40 Aussies and struggling to hear my radio over the noise of water hitting stainless steel, excited voices in my ear- piece said Gilchrist was out!! For one run!! My excited shout of ‘Gilly’s gone!!’ was greeted with sudden silence. The sound of water on steel had instantly stopped as the shock news interrupted 35 flows. It remains the most satisfying moment of my life. Thanks for your brilliant OBO.” What an image. We should be so lucky to have anything like the 2005 (or 2009!) series over the next six weeks. Is 2009 is the most underrated Ashes contest of the modern era? Forever drawfed by its older brother four years earlier. 5th over: Australia 3-1 (Bancroft 0, Khawaja 0) Anderson’s turn, bowling with five slips from his favoured Birmingham City End. Bancroft gets out of the frying pan from the second ball of the set, acquring a leg bye from his thigh pad. Khawaja defends and leaves well until the final delivery, which evades his outside edge after doing plenty off the track. Jimmy turned 37 this week. So good.4th over: Australia 2-1 (Bancroft 0, Khawaja 0) IT WAS MISSING! Just going down the legside! What a HUGE early moment in this game. Khawaja defends the one delivery left in the successful Broad over. I’ve been asked a lot about the handshakes. I can confirm, via the England camp, that they were not asked to participate by Australia. He’s gone this time! Warner misses a far fuller deliver that is only going one place from around the wicket. Aleem Dar raises his finger and England are UP AND ABOUT. No review considered. Warner looks straight ahead as the Hollies Stand send him off - loudly. BROAD THINKS HE HAS WARNER LBW! Root lets him go upstairs to challenge the Aleem Dar’s decision but it is shown to be going well over the top of leg stump. England give up a referral. 3rd over: Australia 2-0 (Bancroft 0, Warner 2) Anderson beats Warner to begin this time, angling away in that dreamy Jimmy fashion. Later in in the over, he finds an inside edge with one that goes the other way, deflecting back onto his pad. That gives Bancroft one ball to see out and he beats him again with a beauty. Great start.“Did they handshake?” asks Damian Walsh from a meeting room in Madrid. Evidently not. Spicy. Posting the TMS overseas link again for those who missed it the first time around. Fun fact: 62 per cent of emails we get on the OBO in the morning session are asking for the TMS links. 2nd over: Australia 1-0 (Bancroft 0, Warner 1) Broad is down the legside to begin but both he and Bairstow are fairly interested in the caught behind down the legside? I tell you what, the the technology suggests it was... off the toe of the bat? Blimey. Imagine that went upstairs Warner would have been out first ball! Instead, he’s off the mark later in the over with a push through cover. It gives Bancroft a couple of deliveries to negotiate and he’s beaten by the first, again in that channel just outside the off-stump. That’s his spot. Lovely. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Bancroft 0, Warner 0) Jimmy Anderson: set and forget. He beats Bancroft with the third ball of the series, the first that the opener elected to play at. The swing, the shape, the oohs and aahs from the crowd. Delicious. The West Australian makes contact with the last couple, which will feel good. Welcome! The players are on the field! Here we go! Anderson vs Bancroft. The crowd do their thing as the controversial pair make their way to the middle. PLAY! Now for the anthems. This choir, bring them everywhere! Let’s get a few emails in here. My apologies in advance for missing many of these during this morning stint it going to be that kind of OBO. But I’ll do my best to manage the inbox and the updates. “I’ve just had my pre-series hair cut and beard trim so definitely ready for action now,” says Brian Withington. “Going along to watch tomorrow for my first Ashes expedition to Edgbaston in about 20 odd years. Can’t wait - like a kid on Christmas Eve who’s really not sure whether Santa will decide if I’ve been naughty or nice.”Be sure to find us when you get here, Brian. Have a great time. “Enjoyed the Tim Paine presser you linked to,” writes James Walsh. “Did he have time to list the fifteen Test venues he finds more scary than Edgbaston? I’d be fascinated to know which ones they are. I guess Chester-le-Street, due to the Shane Watson ghost incident, but the other fourteen are a spooky mystery.”He’s only played international cricket at 18! Was lovely trolling work from Paine, I thought. Means nothing now, of course. “Having not watched Australia play much Test cricket since the last Ashes, and even then in an often sleep deprived state, I was thinking I didn’t have too much knowledge of Travis Head, or indeed of Tim Paine the keeperbatsman (I’ve read plenty on his captaincy),” says Matthew Potter. “I know a fair bit about the battle for number six due to your discussions on your pod. Care to fill me in? Head likely to make some match winning knocks? Is Paine’s captaincy and glovework worth his one first class hundred?”Okay, let’s do Trav Head. He was made captain of South Australia at 21 they love his leadership skills. He is no-nonsense but quite Gen-Y in the way he will happily have a lash at anything outside the off-stump, where he is very strong. But he did get caught at third man twice in a Test last summer. Made a ton to finish the home season against Sri Lanka, securing his spot. That he’s vice-captain suggests they see him as a potential long-term skipper. Nice fella, too.Jerusalem is being sung, rather beautifully, by a choir beneath me in front of the pavilion. This is really cool. Interested in the history of the hymn as it relates to English cricket? I wrote an essay on it. “Going on a tangent here,” as is your right as an OBO emailer, Abhinav Dutta. “So I am sat at work, fuming at my bosses and squinting for some corner to catch the cricket in without unnecessary supervision. Anyway had to ask, how does one channel Mitchell Johnson like ferocity while retaining the easy going flow of Ice Cube? Would so love to give them bosses a Mitch Johnson death stare before hollering ‘Chickity-check yo self before you wreck yourself’ at their faces.”Gosh, how I loved watching the Ashes when I shouldn’t have been as a kid at school then later when I had a proper job. Lovely memories.“Imagine saying six months ago Hazelwood and Starc would be fully fit and left out,” says Adrian from Melbourne on twitter in response to the PattinsonSiddle love. Quite right. This is a complete shift in thinking from the dogmatic approach in 2015 where there was a pecking order and That Was That. This is very Tim Paine. He explained it well when talking to us a couple of days ago. That TMS link I put up was the non-UK one, to avoid any confusion. If you are in the UK, pick it up at the usual BBC places.“Just wondering,” asks Peter da Silva. “Has the fusion of his spine changed his bowling style, would have thought it would have to? Vague memory of him being a bit of an all rounder in the 2013 series in England before getting injured.”He changed his bowling acting for a time after the 2013 injury but doesn’t look that different to when he arrived. For comparison purposes as we move through the Test, was his debut in 2011.Shane Warne is happy with the attack. Not surprising, given his long-held views on Mitch Starc. Those teams as named. An easy decision, he says. “It looks better than we were expecting it. It looks hard and dry.” He then talks about having Nathan Lyon at his disposal later in the game. As for the team... Pete Siddle is IN!Six changes from the last Test Australia played in. As expected, no Starc and Hazlewood Cummins and Pattinson are the other two seamers. A big, bold call from the Australian camp. “We think Pete Siddle in this match complements the other two very nicely.”Joe Root is “not disappointed at all” to be bowling first. “We have a very strong bowling attack for these conditions.” They are as named at the press conference yesterday with Anderson, Broad, Woakes, Stokes and Moeen his bowling attack. “Of course,” it is a boost to the team, he says, that they get to play the First Test at Edgbaston. Just quickly before I’m asked... the TMS link, thanks to Alastair Ferguson. Enjoy! Norcross is in fine form, I can assure you of that.“Good morning.” Hello Tom Marlow. He then makes about 17 jokes about the Newslands saga. I’m going to publish them all, unedited, and that’ll be that in terms of today’s OBO, I reckon. Sound good? “Australia look good on paper but with the suspended players all back can it still be called a scratch side? I wonder if their tactics will go with the grain or will they have some well-polished new drills? Roughly speaking it might be a grind playing five tests after the WC but I’m sure Smith is looking forward to getting his pads on, Warner will be buffed up for the contest and Bancroft will want a smooth transition back into the fold even if the reception might be abrasive. Anyway, I’m sure the only DIY cricket we’ll see is the kind of improvised not-in-the-manual brilliance all these Test players are capable of. Shine on you cricketing diamonds. I can’t wait.”Very good. Thanks, Tom. But yes, let’s talk cricket - not sandpaper.Steve Smith is on Sky Cricket with Nasser. He has him in the nets in a pre-filmed feature, going through his strange set-up and so on. If this were any other series, Smith and Warner’s return would be the only story - but this is no normal series. “I don’t particularly like watching that much,” Smith said in relation to his batting obsession. He’s now got Nas throwing balls at him! He can’t be stopped! I saw a senior Barmy Army member in the lift in this morning who told me they have 500 members ready to roll this morning in the Hollies Stand. It’ll be fun to watch but I don’t think it’ll mean much. The track is “very dry and very hard” according to Shane Warne. “This toss is a lot bigger than people think.” Andrew Strauss agrees: “This is a massive bat-first wicket.” Interesting. Toss in five!Steve Waugh is here with the Australian team. Just as it was during the World Cup when Justin Langer had Ricky Ponting in a tracksuit, the former captain is serving as a mentor. Here he was pre-Test.Nice bit from Ian Ward on Sky Cricket then. “Athers, what would you do if you won the toss?” He replies: “Bat.” Ward again, looking at Nasser: “Actually, I’m not going to ask you.” Very good. What do we think of the World Test Championship? It begins today as well, don’t you know. The main thing you will notice this morning is that there are numbers on the players’ shirts. But there is more to it than that. The WTC, in short:That’s probably all we need to know for now. Better than the alternative? Of course. Room to improve after this first two-year cycle? Absolutely. I’m looking forward to it. Some highlights from Joe Root’s presser, too. Speaking of Tim Paine. His press conference yesterday provided plenty of fresh meat. Is Edgbaston the most intimidating venue where he has played? Naaaah, not in the top 15, champ. The Churchill non-quote was good craic too. All fun and games. To shake or not to shake? Lovely little exclusive for the first morning of the Ashes via  scoop master Ali Martin. Had a funny old time last night. From Birmingham to Bristol for the final Women’s Ashes T20 then back to where we started. I’m not entirely sure where Geoff Lemon ended up sleeping, but that’s the way these things go sometimes. On the park, Katherine Brunt turned the clock back (29 not out and 321) and England found a good’un, Mady Villiers, who combined with fellow 20-year-old tweaker Sophie Ecclestone for five matchwinning wickets between them. But it was a consolation win, the trophy very much going back to Australia - retained at the earliest possible opportunity finishing the multi-format series with a points triumph of 12 to 4. Ellyse Perry was magnificent throughout (finishing 60 not out in the failed chase last night), leading the tournament for both runs and wickets. Of course.After play, Charlotte Edwards declared that there has never been a better women’s player in the history of the game than Perry. James Pattinson is speaking on Channel Nine in Australia. He is very excited, as you would expect. Acknowledges the nerves in the rooms but the positive vibes as well. Happy with the preparation down in Southampton last week. Day one is about setting the tone. Have you see Patto bowl recently? If not, get your eyes on this from the Sheffield Shield final in March. It’s hard to believe that only this time last year, after having his spine fused together in an operation over in New Zealand, there was no guarantee he’d bowl in long-form cricket again. At last, at age 29, he is back in business. Big time. Oh boy, here it is. Morning one. So much build up, so much phony war, so much Ashez Bantz. But it means not a jot when the clock strikes 11 here at Edgbaston this morning. You know it’s a Big Day on the cricket calendar when we fire up the OBO this far out from the first ball and days don’t come much bigger than this for us here.The news from the ground is that the weather is a image directly from Jimmy Anderson’s dreams: muggy and cloudy. The track is brown, but I am told the grass that was there yesterday will still be present when the first ball is bowled. Surely this also means that Pete Siddle will win the final spot in the Australian side - a great story.Those comeback tales are everywhere in the away dressing room: James Pattinson’s fused spine, Matt Wade’s return from nowhere, Tim Paine’s remarkable career arc. That’s before even thinking about the return of the Sandpaper trio, all available today for their first outing in the baggy green since that fateful day at Newlands. For the hosts, their side contrasts nicely in terms of the volume of all-rounders they will be picking. Jofra Archer won’t be in the XI - so Joe Root told us yesterday - but with Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes they have the combination they want for this ground. Of course, it is a venue where England haven’t lost a Test Match for 11 years where Australia haven’t saluted for 19. Back then, it was routine for those dominant sides to win in this country - doing so four times on the trot - but they haven’t retained the urn here since.Urgh! So many storylines! So much to think about. With this much time up my sleeve, I’ll leave it here for now and simply encourage you to drop me a line. How are you feeling? Good morning to you all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04ec0a1396dda6a56f758b1c5779960992d964e6/0_358_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a2b123d7e4db200a7020550d4a7081","title":"golf womens british open 2019 first round live","story":"Park fails to hit her birdie putt on 16, the ball dying to the left.

And Jennifer Kupcho, the brilliant young American who won this years inaugural Augusta Women’s Amateur, and having since turned pro came second in last week’s Evian, drains a monster across 13 for birdie. That must have been the best part of 80 feet! Sadly she’s been struggling today, perhaps understandably so after such a huge effort on Sunday in shooting 66. And the birdie only takes her back to +3. But Kupcho has game. She’s a really exciting player to watch.Park Sung-hyun steps on the gas again. She rolls in a straight 30-foot birdie putt on the par-five 15th, then sends her second at the 16th pin high to eight feet. She’s -5, and will have that to take a two-shot lead. It’s been a relatively disappointing year in the majors for Park, the 2017 US Open and 2018 PGA winner. She nearly snatched the PGA from under the nose of Hannah Green, and was in the mix at the Evian before fading very badly indeed in the final round, driving and putting extremely erratically. But it would seem she’s shrugged off that disappointment quicksmart.Hull is out in a superstar threeball this morning. She’s playing alongside the reigning PGA champion Hannah Green, who secured her first major at Hazeltine in June by holding off a charge from Park Sung-hyun, and Shanshan Feng, the 2012 PGA winner. Feng came into this tournament in hot form, having finished in a tie for second last week at the Evian, and won the Thornberry Creek Classic in her previous outing. Her last eight rounds of tournament golf: 64, 67, 65, 63, 69, 66, 68, 68. That run could come to an end today, sadly. She’s +2, having just pulled a par tiddler left at the par-three 14th. Green also three putts the hole to bogey. It’s her first bogey of the day ... but she’s had two doubles as well. And five birdies! So she’s level par. The dictionary definition of a rollercoaster ride, right there.And it’s already bubbling up nicely at Woburn! Park Sung-hyun, deposed last Sunday as world number one by ANA Inspiration and Evian champion Ko Jin-young, has responded in the fashion you’d expect. Out in 32 this morning, she also birdied 10 to take the early lead at -5. But she’s since dropped a stroke at 11. And now she’s been joined at the top by Charley Hull, who had been long tipped as the woman most likely to end England’s wait for a major, since Karen Stupples won this tournament in 2004, only for Georgia Hall to beat her to it last year. Out in a relatively quiet 35, the 23-year-old from Kettering has exploded since the turn, with birdies at 10, 11 and 12.Welcome to the ’s live hole-by-hole coverage of the 2019 Women’s British Open from Woburn. It’s the fifth and last major of the year, coming a whopping four days after the dramatic conclusion of the fourth, the Evian Championship in France. Georgia Hall, on her home course, will defend a title won last year in swashbuckling fashion, pipping Pornanong Phatlum in a head-to-head battle with some heat-seeking approaches over the closing stretch at Lytham.There’s been plenty of early action already.

I’m now moving house and setting up a home office. I want to dispense with my laptop – the source of my problems – and buy a desktop and an ergonomic keyboard.I’m confused about whether to get an all-in-one or a PC with a separate monitor. I am only really going to use it for internet and typing articles. I realise that this means I can look to the cheaper end of the market, but is there much slowdown in speed at that end? Should I be spending the money to get a good processor? PollyLaptops can be considered harmful if used for prolonged serious work rather than casual use. If you have neck and shoulder problems, you should seek medical help. I’ve been saved twice by an excellent physiotherapist, at my own expense. I’ve also spent time and money mitigating problems, but there is no panacea. Buying an ergonomic keyboard is only one part of a solution that could also include the mouse, desk, chair, lighting, work habits and, perhaps, glasses.You don’t need a computer to get a repetitive strain injury (RSI). Housemaid’s knee, tennis elbow, writer’s cramp, potter’s wrist and other afflictions are much older than iPad neck, but they all have similar causes. According to the UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the risk factors include repetitive work, the use of sustained or excessive force, awkward and static working postures, and doing the same thing for long periods without taking rest breaks. Without job rotation, that last one may be the hardest to solve, though software can help.Unfortunately, people tend to feel invulnerable until they get an RSI. Just as losing a hard drive tends to persuade people that backups are a good idea, carpal tunnel syndrome is a great spur to taking ergonomics seriously. It’s better to do something before you reach that stage.Start with a sheet of paper, a tape measure, and a friend. Drawing a stick-figure diagram with your measurements will help you find products that will work well for someone of your height.To get the correct posture, your feet should be flat on the floor, and when sitting upright, your eyes should be roughly level with the top of the screen. Your friend can then measure the distance between your eyes and the floor. Everything else has to fit in between.Your thighs should be at right angles to the floor or pointing very slightly downwards, which will fix the height of the seat of the chair. This won’t happen by magic, which is why proper office chairs have adjustable seats.As a cross-check, extend one arm horizontally. It should almost touch the centre of the screen.When you are trying to find the most comfortable position, some tweaking is inevitable. It’s therefore better to buy products that allow for minor adjustments. You can fudge things with cushions, footrests, and books under monitors, but it’s better to do it right.Some people have switched to standing desks, and some devices provide a choice. Varidesk, for example, says that “our simple design takes you from sitting to standing in just 3 seconds, requires no assembly and works with your existing furniture”. It also has a 30-day money-back guarantee. Other options range from aiBox’s ultra-cheap cardboard version to the motorised Gazedesk, which you can set by entering your height and weight in its smartphone app.A panel of experts commissioned by Public Health England recommended standing desks in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, so I feel guilty for never have tried one.An ergonomic keyboard lets you align the keys with your hands and arms, so there is no bend in your wrists. It may take months of small adjustments to reach that stage, so flexibility helps.Technically, almost any computer system will work if you set it up correctly. I prefer tower systems, which usually last longer because they are easier to expand, upgrade and repair. They have plenty of space for cooling, so they can use hotter, faster chips with TDPs of 60W to 130W. Laptops use cooler, slower chips – typically 5W to 25W – because it’s hard to manage heat in confined spaces, and their processors are throttled when they start to overheat.All-in-ones are tidier but they don’t have the power and expandability of a proper desktop, and you don’t get a choice of monitor. Also, if either the PC or the screen fails, you may lose both. If space is a problem, I’d rather go for an SFF (small form factor) or mini-PC instead.Several people have asked about buying new desktops so I may return to this topic, though the “laptop for uni” questions are becoming more urgent.You are right in thinking that you could get away with a slower processor and a traditional hard drive: an SSD makes less difference in a desktop where the hard drive is spinning all the time. However, there are no speed limits in computing, and it’s always better to have a faster PC. You can run more browsers with many more tabs, which would bring a slow PC to its knees.I’d rather not drop below 5,000 for a desktop, and 2,500 for a laptop that gets more casual use. Slow PCs are only cheaper if your time has no value.Have you got a question?

Purnell said that people were “enjoying listening to us in different ways, with a record 75m downloads of Radio 4 programmes and podcasts this quarter”.One success for the BBC has been the rejuvenated Radio 1 breakfast show hosted by Greg James, which has attracted record figures on his watch by eschewing a celebrity-focused show and instead producing a format appealing to younger listeners and to their parents.Rupert Murdoch’s News UK has continued to invest in its signing of Chris Evans on the relaunched Virgin Radio, increasing the audience for his programme slightly, to 1.1 million listeners a week. His old BBC Radio 2’s breakfast show slot, now hosted by Zoe Ball, has performed less well. It fell by 700,000 listeners to 8.3 million, suggesting some had followed Evans to his new home.Global Radio, which faced criticism after sacking most of its regional programme hosts on its Capital and Heart networks in a series of job cuts this year, has begun to see the commercial benefits its relaunched nationwide Capital breakfast show hosted by Roman Kemp attracted 3.8 million listeners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e23872185fbc9c9e7cca191f400a7fa0ac732c/46_0_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01a30b93c4e64cf2fe094ae098c4e8c9","title":"documentary now why you should make this the next tv show you watch","story":"The perfectly observed American mockumentary series is nothing short of a miracle – and it’s available now on Amazon. Here are the standout episodes to try firstEvery December I contribute to the ’s end-of-year best TV list, and it’s sometimes a little bittersweet partly because a show I truly love will only make it into the mid-40s, and partly because I know my list won’t be entirely complete. Twice now, this has been because IFC’s Documentary Now! was unavailable to watch legally in the UK.Which is stupid, because Documentary Now! is a work of incredible pedigree. Created by Seth Meyers, Bill Hader and Fred Armisen – along with director Rhys Thomas – it’s a series of perfectly observed, highly specific and obsessively crafted documentary pastiches delivered in the straightest way imaginable. To watch an episode is to witness a labour of love take flight, and having to leave Documentary Now! off my list has broken my heart.But this year will be different, because Documentary Now! has just appeared on Amazon Prime. It should be the very next thing you watch.The sheer level of care that goes into every single episode is breathtaking. In an age where television still likes to patronise its viewers, the series works on an understanding of shared appreciation. There’s very little hand-holding here it expects you to have seen the documentaries it parodies. You’ll still have fun if you haven’t but, if you have, you will enjoy it like nothing else. In many ways, Documentary Now! is the perfect show for the age of Peak TV. It’s too specific for everyone to enjoy, but those who like it will love it with their entire hearts.Look, like it or not, Documentary Now! is going to be in my end-of-year list. Here are the standout episodes you should try first, so at least you’ll know what I’m talking about.The first ever Documentary Now! episode is arguably also the best possible introduction to the series. A takeoff of 1975’s Grey Gardens, about two reclusive aristocrats living in poverty in a crumbling mansion, Sandy Passage is a shade broader than most other episodes. Armisen and Hader are both playing women here, and the subject matter has to be pushed into an uncharacteristically absurd area to top the genuine batshittery of the source material. But the look of it is absolutely perfect the lengths that the directors must have gone to in order to replicate Grey Gardens pays off in spades.There is a strong case for saying that David Gelb’s aggressively reverent 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi – about an ageing chef who jumps through agonising, pointless hoops in his quest for perfection – is one of the most influential of the past 25 years. And this makes Juan Likes Rice \u0026amp Chicken my personal favourite. The action is transplanted from Tokyo to Colombia, and the subject now only serves chicken, rice, a cup of coffee and half a banana to his diners, each produced only after a million identical rituals are performed. It’s hilarious, and also much more poignant than anyone would expect. Watch it, then listen to writer Seth Meyers’ episode of the Good One podcast that explores the episode in more depth.Perhaps because its inception came from a SNL sketch about an upsettingly Tory punk, Documentary Now! tends to excel best when parodying musical documentaries. Gentle \u0026amp Soft: The Story of the Blue Jean Committee, Parts 1 \u0026amp 2, which produced the single Catalina Breeze, almost made this list. But for sheer scale of ambition, it has been beaten by Final Transmission. An incredibly authentic riff on Jonathan Demme’s Stop Making Sense, it was filmed as a live concert at the thousand-seater San Gabriel playhouse, California, and features the cast tearing through a 10-song setlist learned over a single weekend. That it works at all is amazing that it works this well is nothing short of a miracle.Writer John Mulaney is a noted Broadway fanatic, and this is borne out in his parody of Original Cast Album: Company, which captured Elaine Stritch’s arduous repeated attempts to correctly perform a Sondheim song during a gruelling all-night recording session. Stritch’s analogue here is played by Paula Pell, who mimics the sequence with a growing impatience that is excruciating to watch. Mulaney plays the Sondheim figure. Sondheim watched the episode. His notes afterwards were: “It’s fine. I don’t have any comments on it.”Between the second and third seasons of Documentary Now!, Hader had shifted focus to his HBO show Barry, which meant that his presence was filled by a number of guest stars. None worked more successfully than Waiting for the Artist, because Waiting for the Artist has Cate Blanchett. Blanchett plays a Marina Abramović-style performance artist, whose work variously involves painting her body and flinging herself at a wall, or putting a bucket on her head and running through mousetraps. And, honest to god, it might be the best performance she has ever given. She is troubled and abstract, sensual and focused, totally committed and brilliantly funny. An almost perfect half hour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb10c180d5e43cbc012fc00fff0d5eb87ff4cf81/0_20_3186_1912/master/3186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd440b0b05a4fc6ba1702e3eaf7e370d","title":"joe biden kamala harris and other 2020 candidates prepare for debate rematch","story":"Joe Biden was the central target as 10 Democratic presidential candidates took the stage for the second debate in Detroit on Wednesday, with rivals attempting to knock the former vice-president from his frontrunner status.Unlike last month’s debate in Miami, however, where Biden visibly struggled to defend his decades-old record, this time Biden was ready for the fight.Biden, 76, was flanked by a crop of younger and more erse candidates intent on casting him as a relic in their fight to be the party’s nominee to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 election.They included California senator Kamala Harris, who in the last debate skilfully attacked Biden’s past positions on ordered busing and segregation New Jersey senator Cory Booker, with whom Biden has sparred over criminal justice and other contenders who have so far failed to make a splash in the race, such as New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Colorado senator Michael Bennet, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, and Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard.The debate opened with what appeared to be a redux of last month’s searing confrontation between Biden and Harris, this time over healthcare. As Harris sought to defend a Medicare-for-All plan she unveiled this week, which would maintain a role for private insurance and be implemented over 10 years, Biden sensed an opportunity.“Anytime someone tells you you’re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it’s going to take 10 years,” he said.“To be very blunt, and to be very straightforward, you can’t beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan.“You’re just simply inaccurate in what you’re describing,” Harris shot back.Countering that Biden’s own healthcare plan would leave out roughly 10 million Americans, Harris added: “In 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.”But Harris, whose breakout moment in last month’s debate prompted a brief surge in the polls, was forced to weather other criticisms of her healthcare proposal.What followed was an unruly and often deeply personal debate over issues that included immigration, climate change and race relations.At nearly every turn, Biden and his past were brought squarely into focus.On immigration, it was Castro’s turn to land a punch when the topic turned whether or not illegal border crossings should be decriminalized. The issue, which has been elevated amid Trump’s policy of separating parents and children at the US-Mexico border, has ided Democrats.Biden dismissed the critique, pointing out he had never heard Castro level such criticisms of immigration policy while serving in the Obama administration.“It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn’t,” Castro retorted.The tenor was not unlike Tuesday’s debate, which exposed the sharp iding lines between the progressive and moderate wings of the party.But whereas the previous night saw progressive stars Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren defending the Democratic Party’s leftward turn, Wednesday was dominated by a clash of personalities and tactics. At times, it devolved into allegations of cynicism and whose framing was most disingenuous.When Gillibrand resurrected a 1981 op-ed in which Biden argued against expanding a child tax credit for high-income earners – suggesting his views had undercut women in the workplace – Biden asked why she had previously praised his work on gender equality.“I don’t know what happened except you’re now running for president,” Biden said.A similarly personal back-and-forth transpired when Booker accused Biden of constantly linking himself to Obama, only to dodge scrutiny over the more controversial aspects of the former president’s tenure.“You can’t do it when it’s convenient and then dodge it when it’s not,” said Booker, who also went after Biden’s role in authoring a tough-on-crime bill in 1994 now seen as the cause of mass incarceration.“There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine,” Booker said.Despite the onslaught, Biden largely managed to stand his ground.In many ways, the evening was a testament to the Democratic Party’s most pressing debate: whether to campaign on sweeping, progressive reforms or frame the election around the urgency of limiting Trump’s presidency to a single term.Biden has built his candidacy on the latter, telling voters the choice before America was to determine whether Trump would forever reshape the nation’s identity or simply go down as “an aberration”.But Warren, who has yet to share the debate stage with Biden, warned Democrats on Tuesday that the White House would not be reclaimed through “small ideas and spinelessness”.Trump dismissed his potential opponents on Wednesday.“The people on the stage tonight, and last, were not those that will either Make America Great Again or Keep America Great!” the president tweeted.In an impassioned plea to his colleagues, Booker warned Democrats that picking one another apart only worked to Trump’s benefit.“This pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn’t care enough – that to me is iding our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here,” he said.“The person who is enjoying this debate the most right now is Donald Trump.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa49fd2f66921ebb6872dfee4bdd87840eaf47f1/0_2_2588_1554/master/2588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db5d60005cc4a2f1c18c02e3c398dfc8","title":"us imposes sanctions on irans foreign minister javad zarif","story":"Washington says Zarif was targeted because he is a ‘key enabler of Ayatollah Khamenei’s policies’ The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, striking at the main diplomatic channel between Iran and the west.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Zarif had been targeted because he acted on behalf of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.“Foreign Minister Zarif is a key enabler of Ayatollah Khamenei’s policies throughout the region and around the world,” Pompeo said in a written statement. “The designation of Javad Zarif today reflects this reality.”Zarif responded quickly on Twitter, shrugging off the significance of the US move.“The US’ reason for designating me is that I am Iran’s ‘primary spokesperson around the world’ Is the truth really that painful?” he asked. “It has no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interests outside of Iran. Thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda.”Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said the move was “childish” and a barrier to diplomacy.Shortly after Washington announced the sanctions on Zarif, the White House’s national security advisor, John Bolton, said the US would renew sanctions waivers for Iranian nuclear programs that allow Russia, China and European countries to continue their civilian nuclear cooperation with Tehran.“I think the idea here is we are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely,” Bolton said in an interview on Fox Business Network. “So this is a short 90-day extension,” he said.A report in the Washington Post last week said the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, had argued for renewing the waivers over the objections of Pompeo and Bolton because if they were not renewed, Washington would have to sanction Russian, Chinese and European firms involved in projects inside Iran as part of the 2015 nuclear deal.The administration had first threatened to sanction Zarif last month, but relented to allow him to visit New York, while strictly limiting his freedom of movement within the city. During his stay in New York, the Iranian foreign minister is reported to have met Senator Rand Paul, who Donald Trump had said was seeking to help negotiations between the two countries.Zarif was the chief Iranian negotiator in the 2015 deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the US withdrew in May last year. In the face of mounting US efforts to kill the agreement, the Iranian diplomat continued to meet his counterparts from Europe, Russia and China, who have been anxious to keep the deal afloat.Tensions between the US and Iran escalated in May when Washington tightened sanctions, in effect barring all countries from buying Iranian oil.Last month Iran seized of the British-linked oil tanker MT Riah in the strait of Hormuz, apparently in retaliation for the UK seizing the Iranian tanker Grace 1 off Gibraltar. Zarif accused London of “ doing the bidding for the Trump administration.”“The Zarif designation is one of the most ridiculous steps I’ve seen this administration take. It won’t meaningfully affect Zarif’s diplomacy, it probably won’t result in much in terms of asset freeze or complications for him, and will annoy other world leaders,” said Richard Nephew, former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ade2b09ecd4b5bb6f808d0c0f5cf76a749befcd/0_0_2644_1586/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c81dc9c97ad6caafb7d70eae83fd02c","title":"who is hamza bin laden heir who sought to revive al qaida","story":"The son of Osama bin Laden, Hamza was seen as an ‘emerging’ figure in al-Qaida before reports of his deathOsama bin Laden’s son, Hamza, is believed to be dead, according to reports out of the US. He had been seeking to stage attacks on western targets with the aim of restoring al-Qaida’s status at the vanguard of extreme jihadist groups, after many years of decline and eclipse by Islamic StateHamza Bin Laden is the son of Osama Bin Laden and Khairiah Sabar, one of the former al-Qaida leader’s three surviving wives. She lived with him in a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where he was killed in 2011.It is believed that Hamza was aged around 30, with the US State Department listing his suspected birth date as sometime in 1989, but the department also lists an alternative birth date of 1986.He is believed to have been born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Bin Laden family have lived for generations and where Hamza’s grandmother and uncles, Osama’s mother and brothers, live today.Hamza spent many years after the 911 attacks, masterminded by his father, in Iran, where he and dozens of other family members of the 911 plotters were guarded by senior Iranian intelligence and military officials.Hamza was married to one of the daughters of a senior al-Qaida leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah. A video of Hamza’s wedding was found in the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed. His family also reported in an exclusive interview with the  in 2018, that Hamza had married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in the 911 terror attacks.Hamza has appeared in al-Qaida videos since he was a teenager. During the family’s time in Iran after 911, Hamza was mentored by Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, who was deputy to al-Qaida’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. In March, Saudi Arabia revoked Hamza’s citizenship after the US offered a $1m (£800,000) reward for help locating him.In their announcement of the reward, the State Department wrote that Hamza was “emerging as a leader in the al-Qaida franchise”.Hamza has made public statements urging followers to wage war on Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv and threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the killing of his father by US military forces.Recently he has been seen as a deputy to al-Zawahiri.According to letters seized from Osama Bin Laden’s compound after his death, Osama was grooming Hamza to replace him as leader of al-Qaida.Osama Bin Laden’s family has said that they thought Hamza had shaken off the ways of his father and they had been disappointed to learn he was emulating him.“We thought everyone was over this,” Hassan Bin Laden, Osama’s brother, told the  last year. “Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, ‘I am going to avenge my father.’ I don’t want to go through that again. If Hamza was in front of me now, I would tell him, ‘God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. Don’t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul.’”The death has been reported by several news outlets, citing multiple unnamed official sources. NBC News reported the US had received intelligence that he had died, citing three American officials. The New York Times, quoting two unnamed officials, also reported Hamza bin Laden had been killed some time over the past two years, and it had taken time to confirm the death.The report said the US had a hand in the death of the al-Qaida heir.Donald Trump was asked by reporters on Wednesday if the US had intelligence that Hamza bin Laden was dead, to which the US president replied: “I don’t want to comment on that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973354.1564636569!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents stressed out and fed up with high back to school costs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe average cost of putting a child into senior infants is  €340, according to a Barnardos survey. Photograph: iStockIrish parents are “stressed out, overburdened and fed up” by the high cost of sending children back to school, according to the charity Barnardos.In a report published on Thursday it said the Government could make school books free for all primary school children at a “minuscule” cost which would amount to just 0.2 per cent of the annual education budget.Its annual school costs survey suggests that parents continue to spend hundreds of euro getting children ready for school at the end of this month although costs have remained largely static when compared with last year.All told, more than 1,400 parents took part in the survey with the average cost for senior infants at €340 while parents of fourth class pupils said they would spend €380, rising to €736 for a child starting secondary school. Almost half of all those who took part in the research said they had to forgo paying bills and cut back on other costs to meet back-to-school costs while as many as 14 per cent said they would be forced to borrow to meet the expense.While 51 per cent of primary school parents and 46 per cent of secondary school parents reported an increase in the cost of school books, most of those who avail of a book rental scheme indicated that contributions would remain the same.The research found that almost 70 per cent of parents were being asked for a voluntary contribution while most schools continue to ask parents to buy crested or branded uniforms. ‘Anything but equal’“Every year for more than a decade parents have been telling Barnardos that their children’s back-to-school costs place a significant financial burden upon them,” Barnardos chief executive Suzanne Connolly said. “Once more it is clear that parents are stressed out, overburdened and fed up of subsidising our so-called ‘free education’ system. The substantial financial cost of sending a child to school means access to education is not free and anything but equal.”She accepted that developing a free education system would not happen overnight “but the Government must take the first step in creating a more equitable system”. “Providing free books for all children would cost a minuscule amount in terms of the Department of Education’s overall budget but it would have a transformative impact in terms of all children starting off with the same resources.”She also called on the Government to provide adequate capitation fees to schools so that voluntary contributions from parents could be made unnecessary.Capitation costsIn response, a spokesman for the Minister for Education Joe McHugh said the Government was “committed to tackling back-to-school costs”.He said the Minister was “making final preparations to shortly publish the student and parent charter Bill”, which would be “key to allowing students and mothers and fathers to have a say on many aspects of life in a school, with costs being a significant issue for discussion”.He added that over recent years “the department has been promoting measures to be adopted by schools to reduce costs, including of school uniforms” and he said there was a recognition of the “need to improve capitation funding for all schools”.Meanwhile, the average annual cost of third-level education is €4,611 per student if they live at home with accommodation costs adding between €3,750 to €4,219 to the total, according to new research entitled The Cost of Education in Ireland, published by Zurich.The research found that the annual cost of college student accommodation had increased by €777 this year compared to the previous academic year while transport costs have also increased with one in five students spending an average of €900 on transport each academic year.

But religion has a way of encroaching into your life, especially in the education system.”Fierce oppositionThe department’s move, however, was fiercely opposed by groups such as the Catholic Church, Education and Training Boards and the Teachers’ Union of Ireland.Documents obtained by The  last year show Catholic bishops warned the department that students who would receive tuition in an exam subject instead of religion would receive an unfair advantage.(Instead, they proposed that such students who opted out of religion should be offered a course in “religious heritage and values as well as ethics”).Education and Training Boards complained of having to offer an alternative subject without being given additional resources to do so.Religion teachers were also highly critical and insisted the circular was leading to widespread confusion by not clarifying the difference between “religious instruction” and “religious education”.While it said “religious instruction” related to the teaching of a particular religion for pupils of that faith, “religious education” was a much wider subject open to all pupils, regardless of their belief.Watered downIn October last year, in the face of this opposition, the department issued a “clarification” of its circular which watered down much of the meaning of the original.In a significant reversal, it said the State-approved curriculum on religious education did not contain any element of “religious instruction, formation, indoctrination or worship”.As a result, opting out of the subject and being timetabled for an alternative subject “does not arise”.However, the revised circular still included some significant changes.It said students who opted out of religious instruction (such as worship or faith-specific teaching) should be timetabled for alternative subjects, rather than doing homework at the back of class.It also said schools should proactively establish the wishes of parents in relation to opting out of religious worship or instruction.This should be integrated with the school’s processes for establishing subject choices generally.New documents, however, show most State schools are ignoring this revised circular.ETB schools, for example, have been recently directed by their umbrella body to “maintain the status quo in relation to the provision of religious education and opting-out arrangements”.The evidence on the ground in many community schools, similarly, is that the latest circular is not being implemented.ObstaclesSources in these schools argue that the lack of funding to provide for additional teaching for non-religious students is a key obstacle.However, schools are required to follow procedures set down in department circular letters.In a statement, a Department of Education spokesman confirmed that the circular applied to all “community and ETB post-primary schools”.Meanwhile, parents such as Helen O’Shea remain as frustrated as ever over what she sees as the violation of non-religious students’ rights and those of their parents.“Schools shouldn’t be allowed to cherry-pick what suits them when it comes to religion . . . It shouldn’t be so hard to uphold a child’s constitutional right to drop out of religion.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973477.1564598256!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools refusing tuition for students who opt out of religion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAtheist Ireland said the failure of State schools to implement these measures means non-religious students are being discriminated against. File photograph: GettyState secondary schools are refusing to implement a directive which requires them to provide students who opt out of religious instruction with access to another subject.Last year, the Department of Education issued a circular requiring State schools to timetable alternative tuition throughout the school year for students who opt out of religious instruction.This was aimed at ending the practice of assuming that pupils are predominately Catholic and requiring non-religious or minority faith students to do homework during religious instruction.The circular applies to State-run schools, such as community schools or those run by Education and Training Boards (ETBs), which account for about half of secondary schools or 160,000 pupils.Voluntary secondary schools, typically run or owned by religious organisations, are not affected by the circular.However, new documents show most State schools are not implementing the circular on the basis that they do no have resources to provide alternative tuition.ETB schools, for example, were recently directed by their umbrella body to “maintain the status-quo in relation to the provision of religious education and opting-out arrangements”. A spokesman for the department has confirmed that the circular, issued in October last year, remains in place and schools are required to follow it.The campaign group Atheist Ireland said the failure of State schools to implement these measures means non-religious students are being discriminated against.“The practical application of maintaining the status quo means students who exercise their constitutional and human right not to attend religious teaching cannot access another optional subject,” said Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland.Nessa White, general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland, confirmed that the umbrella body’s advice to schools has been to maintain the “status quo” in relation to allowing students to opt out of religious instruction.“Religious education is open to all students regardless of their religion or world view. In some instances, parents or students over the age of 18 wish to opt out of religious education. This is fully permitted in ETB schools. “However, our schools have not been provided with any additional resources to provide alternative classes to students who opt out. Our schools cater for these students to the best of their ability with the resources currently available to them.”What about community schools?Ms White insisted that ETB schools are “multidenominational and cater for all students regardless of their religious or non-religious beliefs”.Many community schools are also not implementing the circular, which also requires schools to proactively establish the wishes of parents in relation to opting out of religious worship or instruction.The circular states this should be integrated with the school’s processes for establishing subject choices generally.“Past practice of assuming that the pupil body is predominately Catholic and arranging religious instruction accordingly is no longer an appropriate approach,” the circular states.“ In a changing context the constitutional right not to attend religious instruction must be given effect through changed practices.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973985.1564648735!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ready for the bank holiday weekend here is the weather forecast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBeachgoers enjoy the sunshine in Margate in south east England last week.

London is refusing to accept the inclusion of the backstop while Europe is refusing to drop it. Arnold, in an opinion article for the Daily  published on Wednesday, delivered a scathing assessment of the Government’s policy and approach to Brexit. “This is tough right now, being a proud and loyal British subject who has lived in, and loved, Ireland for more than 60 years,” he wrote in the piece, headlined ‘Bought by Brussels, little Ireland’s ridiculous leaders have landed it in a Brexit crisis’. “What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour.“Whatever faults the British may have, they understand independence and freedom. I can understand why they mock the ridiculous behaviour of these two men.“Varadkar and Coveney are both members of Fine Gael, a party that has its roots in the fight 100 years ago to secure independence and freedom for Ireland. Yet now here they are trying to block the UK’s path to the same independence and freedom.”He described this approach as “painful and embarrassing stuff”, and was highly critical of the EU’s treatment of the UK.“It was bad enough these past months having to witness the humiliations of the journeys to Brussels of prime minister Theresa May,” he said. “Begging at the European Commission and European Council brought her nothing.“One cannot be surprised that Boris Johnson is so far refusing to go to Brussels. He is smart enough not to hazard a rerun of Theresa May’s ill-judged visits to the groups that became her tormentors. “The European Parliament had a brief walk-on part in the humiliations – to approve the draft agreement. They seemed from time to time to be sniggering behind their hands at this unfortunate woman who was betrayed on all sides.”‘Cheerleaders’ Arnold, who has written for several newspapers including The , the Irish Press, the Sunday Independent, and the , accused Dublin of acting as “cheerleader for these tormentors”.“Yet their cheerleading operates in terms that make no sense at all,” he said. “Varadkar and Coveney are increasingly uncertain fools. Their desire to be players in a game they don’t understand is causing their clothing to unravel and their minds to lose their way.“Their determination to work against the UK’s desire for a smooth and prosperous Brexit will in the end leave Ireland diplomatically estranged from its most important trade and political partner.“With some satisfaction I see that public opinion in Ireland is at last questioning their policies.” Arnold, who was awarded an OBE in 2003 “for services to Irish journalism and Anglo-Irish relations”, said Brussels was using the “iel-like euro-eagerness” of the Government “for its own ends”.He added: “Once Brussels gets what it wants, it will dump all interest in Irish concerns.“What Varadkar and Coveney are doing is helping Brussels to block the path for the UK government to implement the democratic decision of the British people to leave the EU. There was a referendum. The people gave their decision.“And yet a Dublin government which brags that it is republican and democratic denigrates this decision as populism. It colludes with the EU to try to have the decision dismissed and resisted.” Arnold’s article in the Daily , which is a Eurosceptic, pro-Brexit, and Tory-leaning publication, was also critical of the Republic’s decision to rerun referendums to ratify the Nice Treaty in 2002 and the Lisbon Treaty seven years later.He described the Lisbon Treaty as “a camouflaged EU constitution which would dissolve their republic into a new supranational state”. The Irish constitution, he said, “is now no more than a worthless gathering of sad memories”.“If you want to understand Varadkar and Coveney’s behaviour, the Lisbon sell-out is the key,” he continued. “Irish politicians are honest: when they are bought, they stay bought. “These uncertain fools have now led Ireland to be engulfed in a crisis as Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, seeks to lead Britain out of the EU either before or after an election.“Yet again we face a crisis of democracy, with little Ireland and the huge EU refusing to recognise the democratic decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. The ridiculous country in which I live is helping Europe in this abuse.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The two leading contenders sparred over health care and other issues. Video: CNN Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer US vice-president Joe Biden touches US senator Cory Booker on the second night of the second 2020 Democratic US presidential debate in Detroit, Michigan. Photograph: Lucas JacksonReutersFormer US vice-president Joe Biden came under pressure from Democratic rivals for his previous policy stances on immigration, women’s rights and criminal justice reform during Wednesday night’s second debate in Detroit between 10 of the party’s presidential candidates.Though his performance was shaky at times, Biden emerged from this debate in better shape than after last month’s debate in Miami.The tension between Biden and California senator Kamala Harris, who clashed fiercely in Florida, was evident within seconds of the two walking on stage. “Go easy on me kid,” said Biden as he shook his rival’s hand, a comment that was picked up by the microphones, and seen by many as patronising. Biden and Harris then plunged into a heated exchange about healthcare.The issue is a weak spot for Harris, who has been equivocal about her support for so-called Medicare for All since she began her campaign. Biden went on the offensive, arguing that his plan would build on Obamacare and allow people to keep their private health insurance if they wished – a key priority for many Americans who are reluctant to give up their private health insurance plans despite misgivings about the health system.Biden echoed the arguments of many on the moderate wing of the party by describing the single-payer system as economically fanciful.“The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $3 trillion,” he said of Harris’s proposal, adding that senator Bernie Sanders’s plan would cost $30 trillion. “Mine is $750 billion,” he said.ImmigrationBut as the conversation moved to immigration, it was Biden’s turn to feel the heat.For the second half of Wednesday night’s debate, the Democratic front-runner came under attack from all sides.Probed by the moderators about why deportations rose under the Obama administration, Biden said he did not believe that people who crossed the border illegally should be allowed to do so – setting himself apart from those who said in the last debate that illegal immigrants should not be criminalised. “If you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back. It’s a crime,” the former vice-president said.In particular, Biden hit out at Julian Castro, the former housing and urban development secretary under Obama who embraces a more liberal position on immigration.“We sat together in many cabinet meetings,” he said of his former cabinet colleague. “I never heard him talk about any of this when he was secretary.”Further trouble was afoot for Biden as discussion turned to criminal justice reform. In one of the most memorable moments of the night, senator Cory Booker criticised Biden’s role in endorsing the 1994 Crime Bill which resulted in a sharp increase in the incarceration of African-American men.Biden responded by drawing attention to Booker’s record as mayor of Newark.CriticismOther candidates also jumped in, with Harris briefly reprising the debate on “bussing” that dominated the first debate, reminding the audience that Biden sided with segregationists.But Harris’s record as attorney general in California also came in for criticism, as Hawaiian congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard accused her of blocking evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row, and prosecuting 1,500 people for marijuana possessions. “When you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people’s lives, you did not,” she said.Towards the end of the debate, Biden also came under attack for his position on women’s rights. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand cited an opinion piece written by Biden in 1981 in which he said that federal subsidies would discourage women from staying in the home and would lead to the deterioration of the family unit. Biden shot back saying that he had always supported equal treatment for women, accusing Gillibrand of criticising him just because she was now running for office.“I don’t know what happened except you’re running for president,” he said. Harris also asked why Biden until lately supported the Hyde amendment — a law that prevented the use of federal money for abortion. Biden failed to give a coherent answer.Overall, the second night of the Democratic debate had no standout performer, though Cory Booker arguably put in the best performance of the night.Biden performed better than his first debate appearance in Miami. But questions about his acuity and age still remain. He stumbled at points and stopped speaking immediately when interrupted by the moderators, in contrast to the other candidates who continued to speak after their allotted time was up.In one unfortunate moment for Biden he referred to Booker as “president”, then corrected himself to say “future president”.Booker retorted: “I’m grateful that he endorsed my presidency already.”Biden may have salvaged his campaign, but serious questions remain about whether he is the right person to take on Donald Trump. With several candidates expected to drop out before the next scheduled debate in Houston in September, the Democratic field will narrow considerably.But with the Democratic National Convention still a year away, it is still all to play for as Democrats decide on their candidate to take on Trump."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Brexit latest news: Donald Trump\u0026#39s former top economic adviser says no deal is better than \u0026#39the state we\u0026#39re in right now\u0026#39Sixth death from listeria outbreak in NHS sandwiches, Public Health England confirmsWhy Hamza bin Laden\u0026#39s jihadist royalty made him nothing more than a propaganda tool for al-QaedaAmanda Knox asks for donations for her wedding -

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

So please, no gifts and no pressure. But if you feel so inclined, we welcome putting on the best party ever for our family and friends,” the couple wrote on a specially set-up website.“Instead of a traditional registry, we’re accepting donations towards the cost of the wedding.”Knox posted this image of herself shortly before traveling to Italy to talk about the Kercher murder and miscarriages of justicePeople who donate will receive a “signed, limited edition” of a joint book of love poems which the couple have called The Cardio Tesseract.They said they had spent all their wedding funds on a trip to Italy in June, when Knox spoke about the murder and her initial conviction at a conference on miscarriages of justice in the city of Modena.But it has now emerged that the couple are already married, having tied the knot in secret in December.Records from King County, Washington State, show that they made a marriage application on Nov 21 last year, and were officially married on December 7.Knox and her fiancé put out a statement on Thursday in response to criticism that they had misled friends, family and supporters.They admitted that they were already married.“We filed paperwork to be legally married in December of last year to simplify our taxes and insurance,” the wrote.They said the event in February would be a celebration of the wedding “with our loved ones”.Meredith Kercher was murdered in Perugia, Umbria, in a house she shared with Amanda KnoxKnox also admitted that she had received significant financial help to attend the event in Modena by an NGO called the Italy Innocence Project.But she said she had still spent $10,000 on security measures, travel expenses for her mother and flights.“The trip was a financial setback for us and we were forced to use funds we’d been saving for our wedding.”The space-age theme of the wedding promises, according to Knox and her boyfriend, “Vikings drinking pan-galactic gargle blasters, mutants schmoozing with Grecian queens and cyborgs.”The couple promise their guests “outrageous costumes, crazier puzzles, mind-bending sets and extravagant alien food.”Ms Kercher, from Surrey, was 21 when she was found dead with her throat cut in the cottage she shared with Knox and two Italian women in Perugia, a hill-town in Umbria that is popular with foreign students.A local drifter named Rudy Guede was tried, convicted and sentenced to 16 years in jail for the murder, with DNA evidence linking him to the sexual assault and killing of Ms Kercher.Knox posted photos of herself dressed as Little Red Riding Hood on social mediaBut suspicion also fell on Knox and her then boyfriend, Italian student Raffaele Sollecito – prosecutors said they had acted with Guede, knifing Ms Kercher to death after a sex game turned violent.They were convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison.The convictions were overturned in 2011 and Knox immediately returned to the US.In her absence, the acquittals were thrown out by an Italian appeals court, before being upheld by the supreme court in Rome in 2015, when Knox and Sollecito were definitively cleared of the crimes.Knox broke down in tears on stage in Modena when she recounted the murder and her subsequent imprisonment.“The truth is that Raffaele and I did not kill Meredith,” she told the audience. “I had zero motivation to kill my friend.” She said she had been cast as a “dirty, psychopathic, man-eating whore.”Brexit latest news: Donald Trump\u0026#39s former top economic adviser says no deal is better than \u0026#39the state we\u0026#39re in right now\u0026#39Sixth

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood.

Its chief executive and chairman Larry Fink sends out a letter to investors each year in which he espouses\u0026nbspthe virtues of investing in with purpose and an eye on social responsibility.But analysis of the investment giant’s holdings suggests that its rhetoric on climate change risks does not match its actions, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).The research charity calculated that BlackRock’s investments in oil and gas firms have dragged down returns as those companies have destroyed value by failing to properly adapt to climate change.Created with Sketch.Fighting climate change with trees: The facts Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study undermines arguments from some fund managers that they must invest in oil and gas firms in order to fulfil their duty to act in the best interests of investors.Three quarters of BlackRock’s estimated lost returns have stemmed from just four companies: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron, all of which have underperformed the market.A fifth company, General Electric, has lost BlackRock investors $19.1bn between 2008 and 2018, when compared to the returns it could have made by investing in shares that performed in line with the wider stock market.BlackRock holds more than half a billion shares in GE which saw an unprecedented $193bn wiped off its stock market valuation between 2016 and 2018.This brutal heatwave is our fault – let\u0027s not forget thatIEEFA attributes much of this collapse in value to the fact that GE failed to anticipate the collapse of traditional fossil-fuel power station construction, a key market for the company which supplies turbines for the plants.BlackRock’s biggest mistake during this period, according to the research, has been its stake in ExxonMobil, which could have netted investors an extra $45bn if the money had been invested elsewhere.BlackRock has consistently maintained that it cannot simply shift funds out of particular stocks because many of its funds are passively managed, meaning that investments are selected by criteria that fit with investors’ needs, rather than having a fund manager who actively picks the shares.But IEEFA argues that peers such as Amundi and Norway’s Norges Bank have developed low-carbon investment strategies that are as cost-effective as BlackRock’s passive investment strategy.As the custodians of trillions of dollars in global wealth, institutional investors are increasingly being called upon to take action to prevent climate change by removing funds from companies who are not doing enough.The problem is more and more being framed as a financial as well as an ethical one.The Bank of England last year estimated that lack of action to move towards a low-carbon future could see up to $20 trillion wiped off the value of assets as they become useless or “stranded”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The sales of iPhones took a 12 per cent tumble and the company’s earnings fell by a similar amount. Yet the shares jumped in after-hours trading.\u0026nbspAs ever, this was partly down to expectations: Wall Street had forecast a deeper e.\u0026nbspThe markets were also buoyed by what chief\u0026nbspexecutive Tim Cook had to say about the future, with new iPhone models on the way, together with his talk about a “marked improvement” in China.\u0026nbspTrump attacks Apple’s plea for tariff waivers on new Mac Pro partsApple buys Intel 5G modem business, dropping major hint at new iPhoneNew iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakBut with this latest set of figures, the company also crossed a rubicon. Its signature product, for the first time in years, provided\u0026nbspless than half the firm’s revenues in a three-month quarter. The latest covered\u0026nbspthe period up to 29 June. It is\u0026nbspthe third of Apple’s financial year and in it the iPhone accounted for 48 per cent, compared to 55 per cent over the same period in 2018.\u0026nbspIts dwindling sales might have been taken more seriously but for the fact that they were more than offset by growth in other areas, helping Apple to post a modest increase in overall revenues – $53.8bn (£44.1bn) against $53.3bn last time.\u0026nbspThe boom in Apple services –\u0026nbspincluding music subscriptions, the App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple TV –\u0026nbsphas been a longstanding theme, and that continued.\u0026nbspMore than 400 million people now have some sort of subscription with the company. It will hope to add to their number through Apple TV+, a new streaming service coming in the autumn, although it is entering an increasingly crowded field at a time when even the mighty Netflix is starting to encounter some price resistance, at least in North America.But that’s far from the only new string being added to the company’s bow. A credit card is coming in August too. It’s not only Amazon that could easily be renamed World Domination Enterprises. Apple is also sending its tanks out to occupy an ever-growing number of lawns and causing shivers down the spines of an ever-growing number of competitors.\u0026nbspDespite all this activity, services didn’t even make the biggest noise in this\u0026nbspset of results, as they have become accustomed to doing. Nor did\u0026nbspMacs or iPads, both of which grew handily. The unit shouting loudest was, in fact, “Wearables, Home and\u0026nbspAccessories” which recorded growth of 48 per cent.\u0026nbspThis is made up of a rag bag of different product lines including smart speakers, headphones, and especially the Apple Watch, which has started to come (very) good for the company after a decidedly rocky start.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

As the port with the\u0026nbspshortest distance to Northern Ireland,\u0026nbspthe harbour had once been the lifeblood of the village. Long before email, 10,000 mail packets made their way from Portpatrick and across the sea to Donaghadee.\u0026nbspThe railway came to Portpatrick in 1862, shortly before the cross-channel steamer services moved to nearby Stranraer. When the government switched the mail service to Stranraer, passengers on the railway between the two villages dwindled, and Portpatrick harbour became the preserve for a small fleet of fishermen and some pleasure boats.\u0026nbspHow the look of council estates has changed over a centuryLabour vows to end ‘rip-off’ by ensuring councils take back servicesThird of councils fear they will be unable to provide vital services“Steam killed the village for sailboats coming in,” Robert Erskine, a lifeboat coxswain since 1984, told me in 2016. “It’s now more a leisure harbour. But it’s still very important as it’s the centrepoint of the village.”I was in Portpatrick to report on a\u0026nbsphistoric moment for residents. In 2015, frustrated at the lack of maintenance by the harbour’s private owners, local people made the decision to organise as a community benefit society, an organisation accountable to the community, and sell shares to buy their harbour and secure the village’s future.\u0026nbspThree and a half years later, the community-owned harbour has catalysed the regeneration\u0026nbspof several other buildings in the village. The society has acquired a row of toilets and a patch of land near the harbour from Dumfries and Galloway council, at a price of £1, to save the facility from closure. Two people have been employed directly by the society to service the toilets.\u0026nbspThe society has now applied to transfer the local village hall into community ownership under the Communities Empowerment Act Scotland 2015.“People are coming to the village and making the comment that they can see the changes,” says Calum Currie, chair of the Portpatrick\u0026nbspCommunity Benefit Society. “The harbour is much busier. We have now made the harbour a venue from which we’re looking at doing more festivals and events.”In England, there are more than 6,300 assets like the Portpatrick harbour\u0026nbspin community ownership, according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and Power to Change. These community halls, sports centres, parks and other spaces contribute nearly £220m to the UK economy every year, its research shows.Three-quarters of these assets are reported to be in good financial health. And the sector is growing: one third of the\u0026nbspassets came into community ownership in the last year.“This is a surprisingly good story,” says Ailbhe McNabola, head of\u0026nbspresearch\u0026nbspat Power to Change. “The proportion of assets in good financial health is really promising. Councils are under huge pressure financially, but with the assets they can dispose of, they are thinking about the community first and how they can continue to provide access.”\u0026nbspUnder the Localism Act of 2011, community organisations have the right to delay the sale of a building or land so that they can develop a bid. They might also register the building or space as an “asset of community value” in order to be alerted if the asset comes up for sale. In Scotland, the government has conferred additional rights to community groups to buy large landholdings and estates through a Right to Buy, which enables the forced disposal of a property if it is abandoned, neglected or detrimental in some way.Eighty per cent of the assets transferred into community ownership are community centres such as village halls. When these are taken out of the equation, the rate of community asset transfer for other assets such as sports centres, parks, open space and libraries is increasing even faster, McNabola says.\u0026nbspIn Wolverhampton, the council has given a longterm lease for a piece of land and stadium to Bilston Town Community Football Club, giving it ownership over an asset that has helped the club survive during a difficult financial period. In Liverpool, a piece of neglected local authority land was sold to Squash, a community food initiative, and is now occupied by modern cafe, gallery and gardens. Meanwhile in Dauntsey Lock, Wiltshire, residents registered a local pub, The Peterborough Arms, as an asset of community value to give them the time to raise £225,000 to buy it from private owners who wanted to turn it into residential property.“It’s a combination of a good policy environment, which has raised the profile of community asset transfers, and austerity, where councils have had their budgets cut are not able to maintain buildings in the way they once did,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays. She notes the\u0026nbspexample of community-run libraries, which have grown from very small numbers to an estimated 500 in England by the end of 2018.These community asset transfers are part of a much broader picture of councils selling assets to stay in the black as their grant from the central government has shrunk by 60 per cent since 2010. In March, an investigation by the Bureau Local and Huffington Post revealed that local authorities have sold more than 12,000 public spaces since 2014-15.\u0026nbspBut McNabola\u0026nbspsays that when asset transfers are done well, everyone benefits. “You have to make sure that the assets handed over are not a liability and that councils are working with communities in a sustainable way,” she says. “A council should be there to help with the self-realisation of the community, not to make money.”\u0026nbspThe transition from owning a community asset to doing buildings and facilities management can be a challenge for community organisations. “It’s about engaging with the community early on, thinking about governance and making sure the group has the support they need,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays.Austerity-hit councils in \u0027Great British selloff\u0027 of public buildingsDumfries and Galloway Council says that its approach to community asset transfer is to support communities to develop their ideas to deliver services with and for the local community. “At a time of austerity, when councils cannot deliver all of the traditional services, we work with communities to help them realise their ambitions and provide local solutions to local issues,” a spokesperson said. The council noted that it only transfers a property when it can be assured that the business plan is supported by the local community and able to generate a sustainable income.Currie believes the Portpatrick\u0026nbspHarbour Community Benefit Society now has\u0026nbspa stable of assets that will support its acquisition of the village hall – and help them break even in the first year.\u0026nbsp“For a community group to take on a village hall takes a lot of planning and involvement,” he says. “But we have the support of the village.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its chief executive and chairman Larry Fink sends out a letter to investors each year in which he espouses\u0026nbspthe virtues of investing in with purpose and an eye on social responsibility.But analysis of the investment giant’s holdings suggests that its rhetoric on climate change risks does not match its actions, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).The research charity calculated that BlackRock’s investments in oil and gas firms have dragged down returns as those companies have destroyed value by failing to properly adapt to climate change.Created with Sketch.Fighting climate change with trees: The facts Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study undermines arguments from some fund managers that they must invest in oil and gas firms in order to fulfil their duty to act in the best interests of investors.Three quarters of BlackRock’s estimated lost returns have stemmed from just four companies: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron, all of which have underperformed the market.A fifth company, General Electric, has lost BlackRock investors $19.1bn between 2008 and 2018, when compared to the returns it could have made by investing in shares that performed in line with the wider stock market.BlackRock holds more than half a billion shares in GE which saw an unprecedented $193bn wiped off its stock market valuation between 2016 and 2018.This brutal heatwave is our fault – let\u0027s not forget thatIEEFA attributes much of this collapse in value to the fact that GE failed to anticipate the collapse of traditional fossil-fuel power station construction, a key market for the company which supplies turbines for the plants.BlackRock’s biggest mistake during this period, according to the research, has been its stake in ExxonMobil, which could have netted investors an extra $45bn if the money had been invested elsewhere.BlackRock has consistently maintained that it cannot simply shift funds out of particular stocks because many of its funds are passively managed, meaning that investments are selected by criteria that fit with investors’ needs, rather than having a fund manager who actively picks the shares.But IEEFA argues that peers such as Amundi and Norway’s Norges Bank have developed low-carbon investment strategies that are as cost-effective as BlackRock’s passive investment strategy.As the custodians of trillions of dollars in global wealth, institutional investors are increasingly being called upon to take action to prevent climate change by removing funds from companies who are not doing enough.The problem is more and more being framed as a financial as well as an ethical one.The Bank of England last year estimated that lack of action to move towards a low-carbon future could see up to $20 trillion wiped off the value of assets as they become useless or “stranded”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the rollout of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full rollout of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.Created with Sketch.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The debate deepened after reports a video had been filmed by private investigators of sex acts taking place in the clubNew orders fell as businesses used up stockpiled materials, EU businesses moved supply chains out of the UK and weakness in the global economy stifled demand from both domestic and export markets.Unsurprisingly the decline in employment levels followed suit with one of the sharpest cuts to jobs for more than six years as businesses hesitated to keep calm and carry on and build staff levels.Employment in manufacturing decreased for the fourth month in a row, with the pace of decline accelerating to one of the highest over the past six-and-a-half years.Demand was weaker from domestic and overseas markets. The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the rollout of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full rollout of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.Created with Sketch.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The birth rate was the lowest ever recorded, when births are measured as a proportion of the total population.“The total fertility rate stood at 1.7 children per woman, lower than all years except 1977 and 1999 to 2002.Japan’s birth rate hits lowest level since records began in 1899Scotland\u0027s birth rate continue to fall, figures show“The proportion of live births to non-UK mothers fell for the first time since 1990. The stillbirth rate reached the lowest level recorded for the second year running.“There were 657,076 live births last year, the fewest since 2005 and a drop of almost 10 per cent\u0026nbspsince 2012.”Clea Harmer, chief executive at stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said: “This continuing downward trend in the deaths of babies before birth is very welcome but, until the figures can be seen alongside mortality rates for babies who die shortly after birth, it is too early to comment on whether we are on track to meet the English Government’s ambition to halve deaths by 2025.”Population Matters director Robin Maynard says that fewer births and lower fertility are good for the UK.\u0026nbspHe said: “People understand that a higher population means more pressure on the NHS and schools, more land being consumed for more housing that is more difficult for people to afford, more traffic and a lower quality of life.\u0026nbsp“They recognise that it puts our environment under threat and compromises our ability to meet our climate change targets.”\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by PA\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even countries that do apply a time limit to immigration detention do not operate such a short one.”A number of high-profile Conservative MPs have told The Independent the Home Office must urgently reconsider this decision.Immigration detainees\u0026nbspheld for more than 28 daysFormer Brexit secretary David Davis said it was a “very bad decision”, adding: “I urge the home secretary to review it as a matter of urgency, since I believe that parliament will take a different view to the government on this matter.”Describing the absence of a time limit as “clearly perverse”, Mr Davis said: “People who have been human trafficked are effectively being treated as criminals with indeterminate sentences. What really puts the public at risk is the Home Office’s poor administration of its deportation policy.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, it is by no means clear that people who are held in detention centres are those who are a real risk to the public, since there is evidence of people who are a risk being released early.”Andrew Mitchell, former international development secretary, said: “I am sure that the Home Office will want to think carefully about this because when the matter comes before the House of Commons, as it undoubtedly will, the House of Commons may well take a different view.”Home Office should no longer have power to detain people, MPs sayFormer attorney-general Dominic Grieve said he was sorry to hear the Home Office’s response, adding that failing to implement a time limit was “leading to injustice”.\u0026nbspHe continued: “It was never going to be a blanket demand, but we need an adequate limit, rather than the system which prevails at the moment, where people can be detained for very long periods even though the Home Office doesn’t want it, and then they eventually release the people back into the community.”The Independent recently reported on the case of a Zimbabwean man who\u0026nbspwas detained under immigration powers for more than four years – an experience he said made him feel suicidal.In April, the prisons watchdog revealed self-harm among detainees in Colnbrook removal centre, one of Britain’s largest detention centres, had surged threefold in the last three years despite a considerable drop in the population.People detained under Immigration Act powers in 2018In response to Ms Nokes’ letter, chair of the committee, Harriet Harman, said: “Home Office immigration detention is arbitrary, unfair and breaches human rights. Repeated detention and release, which characterises the system, shows that it must be reformed.“Parliament will have the opportunity to consider changing the law to protect people from arbitrary detention when the Immigration Bill is brought back.\u0026nbspI’m hopeful that with the strong cross-party backing for the proposals from our committee and the Home Affairs Committee it will do so.”Pierre Makhlouf, assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, condemned\u0026nbspthe Home Office’s “cavalier attitude to the deprivation of liberty”,\u0026nbspadding: “The government\u0026nbspignores the fact that people are held in immigration detention sometimes for months and years when their removal cannot be enforced.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“No one is detained indefinitely. Most people detained under immigration powers spend only short periods in detention.\u0026nbsp“We have made significant improvements recently, but we are committed to doing more and introducing further alternatives to detention, increasing transparency and improving the support available for vulnerable detainees.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party will hold 321 seats, while other parties and independent MPs will hold the other 320.The position isn’t quite as precarious for the new prime minister as it seems, however. In most cases, Johnson will be able to rely on the support of Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, who had the Tory whip removed this month when he was charged with sexual assault, an accusation he denies.\u0026nbspThe reason Jeremy Corbyn held back from tabling a motion of no confidence in Johnson’s government last week was that it was certain to be defeated: in addition to Elphicke, Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, voted with Theresa May in the last vote of no confidence in January, and Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, former Labour MPs, abstained.\u0026nbspYet the arithmetic of a future vote of no confidence, if it were designed to stop Johnson pursuing a no-deal Brexit, is unpredictable, and every single vote could count.\u0026nbspIf Jane Dodds, the Liberal Democrat candidate and the party’s leader in Wales, wins the by-election, it will tilt the balance in the House of Commons a bit further against a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerSo what is going to happen? Only one opinion poll has been carried out in the constituency, by Number Cruncher Politics, which put Dodds on 43 per cent, 15 points ahead of Chris Davies, the Tory candidate, whose conviction for expenses fraud caused the by-election.\u0026nbspDes Parkinson, the Brexit Party candidate, was in third place on 20 per cent, with Labour’s Tom Davies trailing on 8 per cent.\u0026nbspBut that poll was carried out between 10 and 18 July, a week before Johnson became prime minister, so it is possible that Davies might benefit from the national “Boris bounce” in the Tories’ favour. In national opinion polls there has been a shift of about 5 per cent of voters from the Brexit Party to the Tories. That is not going to be enough to hold the seat, which makes the Tories’ decision to allow Davies to stand again – after he was dismissed by a petition signed by 19 per cent of his constituents – all the more curious.\u0026nbspWhat does the Remain parties’ pact for the Brecon by-election mean?The by-election has also been hailed as a test of a common front among the Remain parties, because Plaid Cymru and the Green Party decided stand aside to give the Lib Dems a free run. As Plaid Cymru won a mere three\u0026nbspper cent of the vote in the 2017 election, and the Greens didn’t have a candidate, this wasn’t such a great sacrifice – and in any case the Lib Dems were well placed to contest the seat, having held it between 1997 and 2015.\u0026nbspAll the same, a Lib Dem win today will be a small but significant gain for Remainers, and and for all opponents of a no-deal Brexit, despite the constituency having voted, in line with the nation as a whole,\u0026nbspby 52 per cent to leave the EU in the referendum.brecon and radnorshire by-election\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

emerges,” added the peer, who vowed to pursue the “rather bizarre” matter further.In a separate interview, he said: This case goes back to 2012, it was actually secretary of state Theresa Villiers who was in office when the case was settled, so it\u0027s not a new issue, but we made the very simple point that while respecting of course the fact that people here have different identities and aspirations, nevertheless if you are working in a UK Government department, it\u0027s not unreasonable to expect to see at some stage a photograph of the head of state.Last month Lord Maginnis told the House of Lords that a civil servant had been paid the compensation for “hurt feelings and distress” caused by having to walk past portraits of Elizabeth II.The former Ulster Unionist Party MP said: “This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government.”90th birthday (PA ArchivePA Images)Asked about the issue, the new Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said he had been “delighted” to find a portrait of the Queen hanging in his office at Stormont House.“I also recognise the importance of the Northern Ireland Office being an open and inclusive place to work, able to attract highly-skilled people from across all parts of our community in Northern Ireland,” he added.\u0026nbsp“As an employer in Northern Ireland, the NIO takes its obligations under the Northern Ireland Act and Fair Employment legislation seriously.”DUP leader Arlene Foster launches attack on \u0027belligerent\u0027 EU\u0027Not within realms of normal\u0027: Johnson savaged by Irish leaderMinisters planning for direct rule in Northern Ireland if no dealIn a parliamentary question response published on Wednesday, Lord Duncan – a junior minister at the NIO – said there are royal portraits at the department’s London office.“Royal portraits hang on public display at Hillsborough Castle, and also in the London office occupied by the Northern Ireland Office,” he said in response to a question from Lord Rogan.A government spokesman previously said: “The government takes its obligation under fair employment legislation very seriously.

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The debate deepened after reports a video had been filmed by private investigators of sex acts taking place in the clubNew orders fell as businesses used up stockpiled materials, EU businesses moved supply chains out of the UK and weakness in the global economy stifled demand from both domestic and export markets.Unsurprisingly the decline in employment levels followed suit with one of the sharpest cuts to jobs for more than six years as businesses hesitated to keep calm and carry on and build staff levels.Employment in manufacturing decreased for the fourth month in a row, with the pace of decline accelerating to one of the highest over the past six-and-a-half years.Demand was weaker from domestic and overseas markets. The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This meant using WhatsApp on computers would require users to link it to the original device\u0027s account.The new upgrade will mean WhatsApp will work in a similar way to other apps like Facebook, where users can use the same login details across devices, download standalone versions of the app on any and all of their devices and have messages sync between them all.The latest WhatsApp rumour comes courtesy of WaBetaInfo, who claim the new capabilities are currently under development.Created with Sketch.12 useful WhatsApp features you didn’t know existed Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone.

At least one inidual said Mr Epstein had disclosed his freezing plans to him, too.Four people interviewed confirmed his interest in transhumanism, which is a science for improving the human race through genetic engineering and other methods. Critics have drawn similarities between the science and eugenics.Unrelated to the reports of his interest in transhumanism, Mr Epstein has been charged with sex trafficking of girls as young as 14. The charges follow after a controversial and lenient plea deal a decade ago.Mr Epstein has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces.Created with Sketch.

The idea began popping up in the early 2000s, and was reportedly talked about somewhat openly within some communities that knew him.One scientist who had spoken to Mr Epstein about the idea, Jaron\u0026nbspLanier, said that the financier had told an acquaintance that his goal was to have around 20 women impregnated in his Santa Fe ranch.There is no suggestion that Mr Epstein went through with any of the ideas. His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment on the matter, the Times reported.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But both in word and manner, he was not even close to convincing, and will remain vulnerable to fresh assaults from the likes of Elizabeth Warren when candidates appear at the third debate in Houston in September.“Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let him know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over ision,” Mr Biden said in his closing remarks. “And we choose, we choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything.”At the first debate in Miami, Mr Biden’s main assault came from Ms Harris.

He aims to sell himself as an effective leader who is open to compromise and evidences this with his experience as governorOhio representative Tim Ryan will be running a campaign that hinges on his working class rootsOn Wednesday, Mr Biden was assailed from all sides, sometimes by more than one person at a time. (It probably did not help\u0026nbspthat he started the night by telling Ms Harris: Go easy on me kid!)He was challenged by senator Kirsten Gillibrand over an article he wrote in 1981 suggesting women should not work outside the home. He was questioned by Ms Harris over his support, until recently, for a piece of Republican-created legislation that prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortions.He was attacked too, by Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey who spoke both fluidly and concisely, managed to express genuine warmth, and was generally reckoned to have been among the best of the 10 candidates debating last night.“We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump — but not only Donald Trump, I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump,” Mr Booker said. “Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling.”Biden struggles to explain op-ed saying \u0027women should not be working outside of the home\u0027Mr Biden, who frequently flailed, and repeatedly referred to things he had done as vice president to Barack Obama - a reminder to many that he represented the past but not necessarily the future -\u0026nbspwas not the only one to be challenged on stage.Ms Harris, 53, who had entered the night in fourth place in most polls, was attacked several times over her mixed record as a prosecutor in California, where she has faced criticism for supporting “tough on crime” type policies. While she declined to pursue the death penalty against a man convicted of killing a police officer, for instance, she did defend the state\u0027s death penalty system in court. Her performance on Wednesday was solid, but as with Mr Biden, it paled when compared to the way progressives Bernie Sanders and Ms Warren stole the night just 24 hours earlierAmong the most powerful attacks against her came from congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii.“Senator Harris says she\u0027s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she\u0027ll be a prosecutor president, but I\u0027m deeply concerned about this record,” she said. “There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.”She added: “The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and impact in these people\u0027s lives, you did not.”Among the other candidates, Washington governor Jay Inslee made a passionate case that climate change was the most important challenge facing the\u0026nbspUS, and the world. \u0026nbspBiden struggles to explain saying \u0027women should not work outside home\u0027Joe Biden needs to withdraw- the latest Democratic debate proved thatWho won and who lost the Democratic debate?Democratic debate interrupted by hecklers shouting about immigrationJoe Biden heard on hot mic asking Harris to \u0027go easy\u0027 before debate“We have one last chance. When you have one chance in life, you take it. Think about this. Literally the survival of humanity on this planet in civilization is in the hands of the next president,” said Mr Inslee, one of many of the 20 candidates who appeared over two nights\u0026nbspin Michigan hoping they did enough to qualify for the third debate in Texas.The Democratic National Committee has said it will double the qualification standards for the third debate, an attempt to thin out the crowded field. Mr Biden will certainly be there. But his performance tonight has ensured that\u0026nbsphe will again be the one his rivals will turn on.The great unknowable question is how badly these attacks damage him in the eyes of voters. After the first debate, he saw his lead slip by up to 10 points, but it had almost recovered by the time he travelled to Detroit.\u0026nbspThe challenge for Mr Biden, who did not look happy the entire night, may be less his polling numbers, rather than whether he can persuade major Democratic donors and grassroots activists that he is the man to get behind in 2020. On that question, Mr Biden still has a mountain to climb.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He then disappeared for a while, before coming back to hit\u0026nbspJoe\u0026nbspBiden\u0026nbsprepeatedly over criminal justice reform with some choice language. Booker showed none of the deference you’d expect\u0026nbspfrom a young senator to a veteran politico who served eight years as vice president – at one point dismissing Biden’s “phony rhetoric” – but that ruthlessness made his performance all the more memorable.This wasn’t in the same ballpark as her\u0026nbspperformance in the first debate, where she confronted Biden over bussing. But, after a shaky start where she sounded flustered by Biden’s energetic opening, she regained her footing. There was one uncomfortable moment\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspTulsi Gabbard\u0026nbspquestioned\u0026nbspher record as a prosecutor – but she didn’t fold. She’ll mark this debate as a net positive.All polling numbers suggest he’s got zero shot at winning this thing. He’s even widely\u0026nbspdisliked in his own city. But his undisputed strength is in debating. The most striking moment for him came\u0026nbspwhen he\u0026nbspasked Biden whether he tried to slow the number of deportations when he was vice president.“You want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions,” De Blasio said to Biden. “I guarantee you, if you’re debating Donald Trump, he’s not going to let you off the hook.”After a quiet first half, she managed to hit\u0026nbspHarris harder than Biden did at any point in the evening by pinning her down on her record as California’s attorney general.\u0026nbspIt’s a very fertile line of attack for progressives, though, and Harris knows this. She was prepared, but it was an uncomfortable moment for her.She also used her clout garnered from two tours of duty in the Middle East to good effect, saying: For too long we had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence the toll it takes on our service members.”He was hit from every angle and simply didn’t appear to have the agility to deal with it. He started off with spark when challenged on his healthcare plans, but fell back to his typical mumbles and stumbles under pressure later in the debate. While Harris converted jibes from the sidelines into jabs at her main rival, Biden found himself becoming the punching bag of everyone from Booker to De Blasio. He was, on more than one occasion, happy to immediately stop speaking when moderators asked him to finish his answer, which is generally the sign of a politician in trouble.She had one of the more memorable lines of the night (promising to deep clean the Oval Office if she became president), but failed to make a significant overall impact. At one point, she appeared to be so caught off-guard\u0026nbspby being called upon by moderators that there an awkward pause of several seconds as she gathered her thoughts. Unluckily for her, when she was getting into her stride on gender equality, the moderators cut her off.He looked like a deer in the headlights in the first debate, and needed a breakout moment on Wednesday night. Repeatedly banging the drum for his $1,000-a-month guaranteed income plan wasn’t close to enough.Considering he’s a rank outsider in the race, with little name recognition, he got a lot of face-time with the American public. He seemed to chip in on almost every exchange for an extended period of time – with his hand in the air like the earnest know-it-all at the front of the classroom. But none of the interventions felt significant enough to cut through at home.Strong on climate, forgettable on most other topics he chimed in on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist. But it was not him alone who deserves to take the rap.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hell nahhhh!One fellow arachnophobe suggested: Its probably easier to burn your house down at this point.Another urged her to kill it with fire whole a third said: Just burn the house down and run.And one jokingly suggested she should ask the colossal spider to pay rent.Laree later updated her post saying the spider was removed safely and released.They are sometimes called giant crab spiders or wood spiders because they like to live in woody areas such as forests, sheds, and woodpiles.Huntsmen are members of the Sprassidae family, of which there are more than , species.They live in warm tropical climates across the world in places such as Australasia, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Mediterranean Basin.They are particularly common in Australia and are notorious for appearing inside people’s homes.Adult huntsman spiders do not build webs but instead forage for food.Their diet mainly consists of insects but they are also known to eat small reptiles such as skinks and gekkos.Huntsmen use venom to stun their prey but are not harmful to humans.However, they can be known to inflict a defensive biteprovoked.On average, a huntsman spider’s leg span can reach cm, while their bodies measure about cm.Some spiders can grow to a leg span of up to cm.Huntsman spiders are renowned for their enormous size, with males able to reach a leg span of between  and  inches.In one recent news story, a huntsman was seen dragging a dead mouse up the side of a fridge in Australia.And this month, a Huntsman spider was caught on camera tucking into a possum on the wall of a terried couples hotel room.The creatures are known to invade peoples homes in Australia looking for food and shelter but are not dangerous to humans.Photos of another huntsman took the internet by storm in , after the critter was found on a farm in Queensland, Australia.And a monster spider the size of a dinner plate made news in  after going on the loose in a terried couples home in Queensland."},{"url":null,"title":"girl chemical burns holiday swimming pool","story":"Esme Law was left in tears from the horric burns on her neck, arms and legs - unable to even walk from the pain.And mum Sarah said she was horried as she watched the marks get worse and worse during the familys holiday to Lanzarote, Spain.The -year-old told The Sun Online: At first we tried Sudocrem and Calpol and then a cooling spray prescribed by the local pharmacy, but nothing seemed to work.The marks were just getting worse, especially on her legs.By the third day they looked so sore I phoned the rep and demanded they send a doctor. From then on the doctor had to come out every day.I had to hold her down while he changed her dressings. It was heartbreaking to see her in so much pain.The mum, a nail technician from West Lothian, said her daughter would try to run away every time she saw the doctor arrive as it hurt so much to change the bandages.She added: She was in such agony that we couldn’t go anywhere with her – she couldn’t walk normally without her legs rubbing together and it hurt for her to even sit down.Sarah said it took about four months for Esmes wounds to heal after the October holiday last year, with the youngster left with scars.And she said her little girl was even too scared to go swimming again.Sarah explained: She doesn’t want to go swimming. She was really good before we went and had just started to swim without her armbands on, but now she panics and asksshe’ll get burnt again.It is believed Esmes injuries were caused by a chemical imbalance at the resorts pool.She said: As soon as you get on holiday, the first thing kids want to do is go for a swim. I never thought for a second that something like this could happen.I would have expected something from James Villas but we’ve had no letter, no apology, nothing.It probably isn’t a big deal to them but I saved up all year for that holiday. Esme obviously suffered the most but what happened ruined it for all of us.We couldn’t use the pool, which you really want to do when it’s so hot, and then when we were moved to a dferent villa it was no longer in walking distance of all the local amenities which is one of the reasons we chose it in the first place.Laura Vedrines, a specialist travel lawyer at Slater and Gordon who is acting for the family, added: Anyone with children will know that you only have to turn your back for a second for them to get into mischief, but this was a hazard that no parent would have been able to spot.The family are also particularly upset that no one from James Villa Holidays has reached out to them to apologise or enquire after Esme’s health.All tour operators have a duty of care towards their customers and in this case that was to ensure that safe levels of chemicals were maintained in the pool.Had they done so, the injury and distress caused by this could have been avoided. Thankfully Esme has made a good recovery but it could easily have been far worse.James Villa Holidays said it was unable to comment due to it being an ongoing legal case.But a spokesman added: However, we take the welfare of all our customers extremely seriously and all our pools are subject to laws and regulations set out by the countries in which we operate.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kennel owner pay barking dogs noisy","story":"Sharon Tidnam repeatedly ignored demands to reduce the sound travelling from her yapping hounds in Topcroft, Norfolk, a court heard.Matthew McNf, a barrister who lived m from Low Farm, made hundreds of iPhone recordings last year to prove Ms Tidnam hadnt obeyed a court order.She was finally found guilty of breaching that order in June and ordered to pay Mr McNf in compensation for moving costs.District judge Malcolm Dodds told Great Yarmouth Magistrates Court: This is a very sad case involving four extremely sad people.He said the case should never have come to court and that the whole matter could have been resolved amicably months ago, the BBC reports.Ms Tidnam branded the ruling horrendous and said she and her husband Russell had spent £, of their pensions to fight the private prosecutions.And she criticised the defences Rolls Royce approach to funding the lawsuit.The couple has since installed acoustic prevention measures to their buildings but have just three months to fork out the massive fine.Outside court, Ms Tidnam said: I dont feel like Ive done anything wrong.

with her daughter later calling  as she started to feel sick.But after the paramedic arrived, they declined to take her to AE immediately and instead advised her to take painkillers, the High Court heard.Mrs Austin, who had initially thought she had tweaked a tendon, later had to have her arm removed.She sued the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, claiming her limb would have been savedthe paramedic had taken her to hospital on the previous evening.And after ruling that the delay in getting her to hospital was a breach of the duty owed to the patient, a judge today awarded Mrs Austin the right to damages which could reach £,.Judge Geoffrey Tattersall QC told the High Court that Mrs Austin picked up the bug when she suffered a relatively minor non-penetrating trauma to her arm during the exercise class.The court heard how Mrs Austin began to suffer pain in her arm - with her GP diagnosing her with a torn tendon.Barrister Richard Baker said on the night of August  she collapsed at home in agony.Its often referred to as a flesh-eating disease, though the bacteria dont eat the flesh.Rather, they release toxins that damage the nearby tissue.The condition can start from a relatively minor injury, such as a small cut, but can progress and get worse very quickly.If its not recognised quickly, the condition can become le-threatening.Symptoms can develop quickly, and early signs include:After a few days, its likely youll notice:Necrotising fasciitis is a medical emergency that can spread very quickly.

You know, when you just survive.”Simon Greave, Labour leader in Bassetlaw, Notts, one of the communities the report focused on, said people were fed up and beyond frustrated with Westminsters dilly-dallying over Brexit.He said people in his town wanted the whistle blown on game-playing with Brussels so Britains big domestic issues could be tackled.He told The Sun: People knew what they were voting for.The fact that some decision-makers don’t want to listen is a Westminster problem, not one created by local people in Worksop.The fact is that in Worksopcrime is lower, deprivation is lower and unemployment is lower.Comparisons like this mean nothing though when you’re working all hours to make ends meet, without access to affordable childcare and support for your family.People don’t want hand outs, we want the opportunities we are entitled to, with the chance of better paid more secure jobs for themselves and their children.”Both the Tories and Labour have highlighted that small towns will be the battleground for the next election.Boris promised a substantial cash splurge and Labour hired an award-winning director to make a three-minute film to show its commitment to small towns last year.Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, is delighted Boris has put towns and cities at the heart of his Government already.He told The Sun: I’ve been really pleased that Boris has put the regions and post industrial towns like Mansfield at the centre of his policy agenda.But many in small towns feel left behind and “disillusioned” with the Westminster machine.They feel like politicians don’t care about areas outside of London and communities that once thrived have been left to fend for themselves.One man, from Newport, South Wales, said: Westminster and the government are London-centric, and the further west, east, north you go, you know, the poorer things are.Towns close to Britains biggest cities were losing out twice, according to the JRF, as they fight both London and their nearest neighbour for investment and funding.A woman from Bolton, a town  miles from Manchester, which voted  per cent to Leave, said: I think what we could call traditional working class areas, theyre declined to the benefit of richer areas where people want to invest money - rather than actually investing it areas where it would make a dference to local le.Another woman from Middlesbrough, a city where  per cent voted Leave, said: “We’ve been sort of left in this area.”While big businesses flock to Britain’s cities like London, Manchester and Birmingham – small cities and towns are left to pick off the scraps.“It’s all low paid jobs, so to be able to bring up the area in general, we need people with higher paid jobs, she said.“They need to be more companies to be brought in that aren’t just distribution centres so we need incentives.”Boris has promised to inject cash for improved transport, housing and leisure facilities to reverse decades of decline and neglect in Britain’s towns.Up to  forgotten towns will get a share of the fund under a drive to unite and “level up” the country.He vowed to create a new “golden age” for Britain and declared: “We’re going to put proper money into places that need it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit spending officially","story":"NewsNo Deal Brexit spending officially tops £bn as Boris Johnson confirms huge new fundThe Government has announced they are spending another £.billion in case of no dealShareByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPlans to prevent chaosBoris Johnson leaves the EU without a deal on Halloween will cost another £.billion, the Chancellor announced. The new figure includes plans to stop the UK running out of food and medicine. It is by far the largest spending commitment made since Mr Johnson came to power, bringing government spending on Brexit preparations to £.billion. Labour ’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded it an “appalling waste of tax-payers’ cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson ’s drive towards a totally avoidable No Deal.” He added: “This government could have ruled out No Deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people.    And GMB boss Tim Roache said : “It’s needless, and it’s based on Tory Party isions not the needs of working people. “ The Treasury has earmarked £ million to spend preparing the UK Border for the chaos of a no-deal Brexit, including  extra Border Force officials. And cash will be spent improving transport infrastructure around the Kent coast to deal with massive tailbacks at Dover. The Government will spend a further £ million to ensure the supply of vital medicinestrade routes break down. And more than £ million will be spent on an ad campaign to encourage Brits to prepare for the worst-case Brexit scenario. Some £. billion of the cash will be available immediately - with a further £ billion available for Government departments to bid on as necessary.    Number  insiders now believe leaving without a deal is the most likely outcome, despite Boris Johnson saying publicly it was a “million to one” just days ago. Mr Javid said: “With  days until the UK leaves the European Union it’s vital that we intensy our planning to ensure we are ready. “We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. Butwe can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one. This additional £. billion will ensure we are ready to leave on  October - deal or no deal.” Best for Britain CEO Naomi Smith said: “This is a colossal waste of money for something both Parliament and the country don’t want. “We know a no-deal Brexit will mean shortages of foods and medicines, and we know it’ll cost the country a fortune. Now the new Chancellor wants to throw billions more at the problem his government is responsible for creating. “Wasting money like this when we have so many other priorities is exactly why the country has turned against Brexit. We need to stop fixating on it so that we can fix the country.”  GMB General Secretary Tim Roache warned Brexit will make things far worse for working people unless Boris Johnson stops fixating on our departure from the EU and tackles their “real le” concerns. Writing for the Mirror, he said: “If politicians do not address the everyday worries of large swathes of the public – orthe outcome of Brexit is to makes things far worse and not better for working people then that lead to a want to tear down the status quo.” “The last PM didn’t learn that lesson,” Mr Roache added. “And the current one couldn’t figure it outit smacked him over the head.” It comes after Boris Johnson reaffirmed his commitment to leaving the EU on October  “come what may” during a meeting with political leaders in Northern Ireland. A Number  spokesman said: “He said that in all scenarios, the government is steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement and that in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border.” The Prime Minister faced a third day of jeers and protests as his tour of the UK’s regions landed in Stormont for talks aimed at restoring power sharing.    The PM promised to be “impartial” in the talks, despite enjoying a cosy dinner with leaders of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Partythe night before. On Tuesday night, the Prime Minister dined with DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds, to discuss renewing the grubby pact Theresa May hatched with their party to prop up her fragile grip on Parliament.    Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance, all supporters of Theresa May’s ill-fated Withdrawal Agreement and the contentious border backstop, warned Mr Johnson of the potentially damaging consequences for the regionthe UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Ulster Unionists, which campaigned for Remain in  but now want to see Brexit delivered, also cautioned the Prime Minister against a no-deal. The DUP again insisted they wanted to see a “sensible” Brexit deal, but said it would be foolish to take no-deal off the negotiating table.

Of course, it is not known precisely when the Duchess penned the letter, but she did reveal that she first began working with Edward in January - four months, before the birth of Archie. It is also possible that her piece could have been edited before publication to include this detail.  Back in January, people who met Meghan during a visit to Birkenhead, claimed she had told them she and Harry had chosen not to find out the sex of the baby so they could keep it a surprise. However over the next few months there were several moments when royal fans questioned whether the couple already knew the gender. For example, when Meghan flew to New York for her lavish baby shower, her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer arrived with a blue gt bag, full of blue tissue paper.

The breakthrough came by identying an electric field around the human eye and dferences in electrical voltage between the front and the back of the eye.    US researchers at Calornia University realised that when a person moves their eyes to look around or blink, that electrical signal can be measured and tracked by the lenses. Made from stretchy polymer films encasing salt water, they change their structure when an electrical current is applied to them. Switching between long and short viewing is done by doing a double blink. Lead researcher Shengqiang Cai said: “Evenyour eye cannot see anything, many people can still move their eyeball and generate this electrooculographic signal.” There are thought to be more than four million people in Britain who now wear contact lenses and rates are increasing. Researchers believe it could help people who are both long and short sighted.

Stephanie Atkinson, , gave birth to her little treasures Herbie and Henry after being rushed to hospital and sent for an emergency cesarean. The twins were born at  weeks after a aposcomplicatedapos delivery which left them both with brain damage. As Herbie and Henry grew, Stephanie noticed her sons, now six, werenapost reaching the same development milestones as other children. Eventually, they were both born with diplegic cerebral palsy. The condition affects the boysapos movement, and they both need to use wheelchairs to get around. Herbie has also been operated on to try and improve his mobility, reports Hull Live.    When they were both born, I had a emergency c section due to both boys being breech and dropping of heart rates, which was very traumatic and they came quite early at  weeks and spent eight weeks being cared for in Hull Royal Infirmaryaposs neonatal intensive care unit, said Mrs Atkinson, who works part time as a nurse. As they were growing up, I noticed at first that Herbie was late in meeting his developmental milestones such as walking, crawling and sitting, and at the age of one he couldnapost sit up properly when he should have been able to. My sons are both six years old now, but Henry wasnapost diagnosed until last year, and Herbie was three when he was diagnosed. The boys being premature, delivery and post birth complications caused brain damage, all of which lead the the diagnosis of diplegic cerebral palsy, which prevents normal development of motor . It came as a shock as we werenapost expecting it, but weaposve had a brilliant professional team of consultants around us that have helped so much.    Both the boys use wheelchairs, and Herbie also has leg splints and walking aids to get around. They go from dferent levels of mobility from walking to needing to be in the wheelchair all day, as their bodies have to work twice as hard as ours do. They can get frustrated and upset because they canapost do the things they want to do. Itaposs heartbreaking at times but the boys just get on with it and we take each day as it comes. Herbie and Henry are both little treasures, and anyone that meets them falls in love with them as they are very happy, outgoing and caring, and really just like normal little boys. They are beautul and we are lucky to have them. It is uncertain what the future holds for Herbie and Henry in terms of their condition and Mrs Atkinson says they just take every day as it comes but that every growth spurt takes them back a bit. She and her husband David hope that with the help of the hospital and physiotherapy, their sons will be able to live le to the fullest and the family are closely supported by their friends and family. In a bid to distract the boys from the pain and struggles their condition can bring, the family were treated to a surprise day by the charity Nice b Nice, which helps children with serious conditions, or that are terminally ill.

Callie Rogers, , won £.million aged  but said: “I was too young.” There will not be many ­people who declare they are happier than ever after blowing a £.million lotto jackpot. But Callie has told how landing a fortune at  plunged her into a cycle of despair as she suffered physical and verbal abuse and was hounded by “fake friends” who only wanted a slice of her fortune. The -year-old insisted she is glad the cash has gone and called on ministers to raise the lottery gambling age limit to . She feels she was too young to handle the pressure and wants to stop other kids going through the same hell.  Single mum-of-three Callie is now earning just £, a year as a carer and living in a £-a-month rented home. And she insisted: “I am the happiest I have ever been.” But she revealed how after her win she lavished hundreds of thousands of pounds on family and friends, endured abuse by total strangers and was beaten up by two jealous women. And she said she is still owed £, by “fake pals” who took her debit card to buy Macbooks and gts for themselves as she partied at the height of her fame. Callie welcomed a government consultation on the lottery gambling age and joined the campaign to raise it. It comes amid mounting fears over the potential impact of gambling addiction on children’s mental health.    She said: “People still ask me about the lottery win all the time. “You are only a , with all that responsibility. At that age, you can get the best advice ever. “But you are not in a position to listen. I was too young. Overnight I went from carefree child to adult. All these years on, it still gets dragged up. “Even when I go for job interviews, I am thinking about it. I suffer from such bad anxiety when I am going to meet new people. It preys on my mind, what a new partner’s family will think of me, or even new friends. I still get abuse just because of who I am.” Callie recalled how when she was told she had scooped the jackpot on June , , making her Britain’s youngest lotto winner at  years and three months, she thought even then it was “too much” money. She was earning £. an hour as a Co-op shop assistant in her home town of ­Workington, Cumbria.  Callie, whose dad Jeff, , recently died of cancer, said: “I did not want that much money. I was in foster care and for the first time in a long time, I was really settled and really happy. When they told me it was a £million jackpot, I thought, ‘I don’t want that much.’ In the end it was shared out and I got £.million, but even then it was hard to take in. “At  you do not know what is ahead of you, because by God I did not expect any of that. I asked the Co-opI could have my old job back.” But Callie moved out and bought her first house at  with then boyfriend Nicky Lawson, the dad of her eldest ­children Kian, , and -year-old Debony. Callie, who also had a son, Blake, seven, and daughter Georgia, three, with fireman Paul Penny, splashed the cash on holidays, cars and presents.    She added: “I would give money to distant relatives and friends of friends. I loaned £, here, £, there. I would never get it back. “People asked for money for new cars and I would help out. I was a soft touch. Now I realise what they were like. I was exploited because of my age. I had a lot of fake relationships.” At age  things took a sinister twist after she and Nicky had a dficult time. Callie tried to kill herself and her children were taken from her. She spent £, on boob jobs to boost her self confidence. But Callie denies she spent £, on cocaine. She said: “Put simply, someone  was going to sell a story on me. “It was put to me that I might as well talk about it. So many people made money from selling fake stories. So I agreed to talk. I know that I was far from perfect. I did what ­teenagers do and I went out and had parties. “But I have never ever been a druggie or blown a load of money on cocaine.” Callie advises any young winners to keep their fortune secret.

Poynton in Cheshire was amongst the worst hit places with the fire service declaring a major incident and rescuing  people. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Servicesaid firefighters, emergency services personnel and staff from Highways England were helping those affected, with a rest centre established at the local civic hall. Rescuers have been working through the night to help people in the worst flood-hit areas. It follows a day of flood chaos across the country with bridges destroyed and roads turned into impassable rivers. In Poynton, police urged people not to ignore road closed signs by driving or walking through water. Have you been affected by the floods  Email webnews@mirror    Poynton Fire Station said its crews had been to more than  incidents, including rescuing at least  people from flood water in the area over a four-hour stretch. Police in nearby Wilmslow also said its officers were dealing with flooding and had evacuated affected residents, with Oakenclough Childrenaposs Centre open as a rest centre. The Environment Agency put out multiple flood warnings and alerts covering central, north-west and north-east England on Wednesday.  On Thursday, Northern rail said flooding had disrupted all lines of the railway between Manchester Airport and Wilmslow. Yesterday, the Army was called in to help in North Yorkshire, where a bridge on Grinton Moor, which featured in the opening stage of the  Tour de France, was wrecked. Soldiers from  Yorks laid sandbags for residents in the village of Grinton, where .in of rain had fallen in just two hours. The Yorkshire Dales, the Midlands and Lancashire were among the worst affected areas, but flood warnings were out for Cheshire, Derbyshire, Notts, Co Durham and Scotland last night. In North Yorks, landlady Rowena Hutchinson, , said rain came in “like a waterfall”, at the Red Lion Inn in Langthwaite, Richmond, leaving her up to her chin in water.    She said: “The water just rushed in from the back. It rushed through, and slammed the front door shut and then it rose up to about ft. “I slipped and went under up to my chin, and then managed to grab hold of a bench and pull myself out, but the force of water and speed was just unbelievable.” She managed to get upstairs and called for help from a window. A fireman later carried her out on his back. The pub, in her family for  years, is unlikely to reopen until after Christmas.  Rowena said: “It’s completely smashed, doors off, and a wall has gone. The speed and force of the water was unbelievable.” Major routes were turned “into rivers” and left impassable in what police described as “shocking” travel conditions. It was the picturesque towns and villages of the Yorkshire Dales which were worst hit. Steve Clough, of Swaledale Mountain Rescue, said: “The roads were a raging torrent and there were sheds and household oil tanks floating down them.    “Some homes had a metre of water in them – it was horric.” His team spent more than eight hours searching properties, rescuing about  people. Firemen went to  flooded homes in the area. The fire station in Leyburn, North Yorks, even flooded while its crews answered emergencies. The Brymor Ice Cream parlour, near Masham, North Yorks, was caught in a freak hailstorm. A spokesman said: “Our parlour suffered damage to the roof, power failures and some visitors suffered minor injuries.” Gareth Walls, from nearby Ripon, tweeted that the hailstones had been “like pickled onions”.  The Ard Rock mountain biking festival, planned for Swaledale this weekend, has been cancelled after the rain left the site devastated. Organiser Alex Rafferty, , said: “The rain just came down off the hills in waterfalls, it blew the riverbanks and has damaged a huge amount of infrastructure, local houses and local businesses.” The storms, which brought , lightning strikes in a day, caused chaos, with parts of a railway line between Kirkby Stephen and Garsdale in Cumbria washed away.

A mathematics professor from Oxford University, who wished to remain anonymous, explained that there isnapost one correct answer - as the equation has been ambiguously written, leaving it open to interpretation. They said: Without better brackets, there can be ambiguity.  There are conventions about the order of operations to try to resolve this, sometimes called BODMAS in UK schools.  If it still seems unclear, itaposs best to include brackets to remove any possible ambiguity.  Mathematicians do not generally have problems communicating with each other about things like this, but for whatever reason people seem to enjoy posing these kinds of problems on social media!What do you think the answer is  Let us know in the comments below."},{"url":null,"title":"big sister saves boy 5","story":"NewsBig sister saves boy, , after rope trapped in lt door hoists him up by his neckThe little boy was nearly hanged as he was dragged up by the moving cabin in Instanbul, Turkey - but he is reported to be recovering well thanks to his quick-thinking siblingShareCommentsByHana Carter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video heroic-sister-saves-brother-hanging-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young girl saved her little brother after a rope caught in a lt door hoisted him up by his neck.The five-year-old was nearly hanged as he was dragged up by the moving cabin.The incident happened yesterday morning in Başakşehir, Instanbul, Turkey.  The three children were thought to be playing a game in a community garden when they entered the lt, according to Haber Turk.

They often venture into Australian homes in a bid to find prey to eat. The large and hairy huntsman spiders are, despite their appearance, not considered dangerous.

Looking back on last week, the boys put in a good performance.“The away goal’s a cushion for us as well, but we can’t go into the mindset of concentrating on having that. We need to go out and give another strong performance to win the game.“We’re back home, in front of the crowd again, so we want to play with the same tempo and momentum we did against the Finnish team– we got at them, created plenty of chances and we want to get on the front foot quite quickly in the game.“Hopefully we score a couple of goals.”McGinn wasn’t surprised Chikhura were able to compete with Aberdeen.He expects them to come to Pittodrie to sit in, hitting the Dons on the break. But he thinks the Red Army can help see McInnes’ men through to a third round tie against Croatians Rijeka.McGinn said: “You can tell they’ve got a few tactically very good footballers.“Given time on the ball they can punish you.“You’re going to these countries, you maybe don’t know too much about them, but you can guarantee there are good players out there.“From playing on the international stage, I’ve been to all of these countries before and they’re always technically good on the ball.“Last week they caused us problems when we lost the ball. Possession was turned over and they were really good on the counter-attack.“They’ll come here with the same mindset to weather the storm a little bit.“Hopefully the fans can come out in their numbers and create a hostile atmosphere for us.”A near sell-out Pittodrie will be totally dferent to the “strange” situation the Dons faced in Tbilisi, with less than , Chikhura and Reds fans in the , capacity arena.Taylor’s injury after  minutes – diagnosed as a torn hamstring – upset Aberdeen’s attacking rhythm, as Jon Gallagher and then Ryan Hedges were forced to fill in at full-back to allow Andy Considine to fill in at centre-half.Left-back Greg Leigh’stonight will ensure all of the Dons’ attacking talents are free to hurt Chikhura, according to McGinn.He said: “It knocked us a wee bit. We started really well in the game, were getting on the front foot and creating chances.“When Ash went down it was a bit of a blow. We’ve got strength and depth, but when Mikey Devlin gets injured and then Ash, it’s not ideal in the centre-back position.“Andy Considine’s come in. He’s played centre-half on numerous occasions and fitted in comfortably.“We’ve got Greg Leigh back tomorrow night, which will give us back the balance we’re used to and allow our attacking players to get forward and create chances.“We’ve work hard behind the scenes this week on dferent things we’ll try and do in the game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.40766518-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.40766518-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.40766518-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.40766518-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"victory over aberdeen would be treated as major news in georgia","story":"The FC Chikhura Sachkhere manager, Samson Pruidze, says dumping Aberdeen would be the club’s biggest ever scalp in Europe.The Georgians face the Dons at Pittodrie tonight in the Europa League second qualying round.The first leg was drawn - in Tbilisi last week.FC Chikhura Sachkhere knocked out Turkish side Bursaspor in  and Israel’s Beitar Jerusalem last season.Pruidze said overcoming the Reds to set up a tie with HNK Rijeka in the next round would be major news in Georgia.He said: “In the last seven years when promoted to the top ision we have participated in European competition.“We have beaten Bursaspor and beat Beitar Jerusalem last year.“If we can beat Aberdeen it would be a big hit for us.

The goal is to score the goal,” he said.“Our team is very good with the ball.“Aberdeen are athletic, move fast, strong and are very dangerous at corner kicks.“We have our plusses too when we play the low ball.”For the first leg in Tbilisi a crowd of only , turned up at the , capacity national stadium.That attendance was only boosted by Chikhura Sachkhere making the match free entry to fans of both teams.A crowd of around , is anticipated at Pittodrie tonight.Pruidze said: “Psychologically we know the spectators come and press their local team because they want to see Aberdeen attacking the other team.“That is normal because they love football here.“The advantage is that Aberdeen have travelled to Finland and then Georgia so have been on the road a long time. So that is a psychological advantage for us.”Meanwhile Giorgi Koripadze, the scorer of the penalty in Tbilisi, believes flying to Scotland four days before kick-off was the right call.Koripadze said: “The decision was the right one from the management because it was time enough to adjust to the climate and environment as it was a long, long way to come here.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"rest and be thankful temporary lights set to be removed by july 31","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTrunk roads authority BEAR Scotland hopes temporary traffic lights at the Rest and Be Thankful on the A will be removed soon.Subject to weather conditions delaying the final stages of work, it is hoped the lights will be taken away on the evening of Wednesday July .This will mark the completion of the first phase of landslip mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful which has involved creating three large new ‘debris catch-pits’ next to the A designed to catch any debris from a landslip and prevent it reaching the roadside.Once completed, the catch-pits will have the capacity to store around , tonnes of landslip debris from the hillside.Teams have recently completed the installation of a m concrete safety barrier along the edges of the three new catch-pits in preparation for the road re-opening to both lanes next Wednesday.The final week will involve completing additional drainage and road markings.Teams will also use the final few days to carry out additional ground investigations ahead of the second phase of improvements, expected to begin in late .

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at lithicsresearch@btinternetPIC:An artists rendering of Argyll#s ancestors making tools. no_aargyllarcheology"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"35-year-old-admits-cloven-wedding-disturbance","story":"A GALASHIELS man has admitted making abusive comments towards wedding guests at a local hotel.Andrew OConnor also shouted and swore as well as struggled with police officers during the incident at the Clovenfords Hotel on April .The -year-old of Church Place, Galashiels, pleaded guilty at Selkirk Sherf Court to a charge of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner.Sherf Raymond McMenamin described the charge as \"concerning\" and deferred sentence until August  for the production of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report and a Restriction of Liberty Order assessment."},{"url":null,"title":"live-borders-announces-scheme-improve-free-access-fitness","story":"NEW leisure link with other areas of Scotland will see Live Borders members able to access leisure facilities out with the Scottish Borders for free.With approximately . million health and fitness club members in the UK it has never been more popular to get into the gym.And now for the first time, Borders people will be able to access fitness facilities in other Scottish regions with their One Club membership.The scheme, known as the Leisure Link Partnership, will allow people working away from home or on holiday in participating areas to use the local facilities, at no extra cost, as part of their existing home-based membership.Live Bordersrsquo One Club members will now be able to access gym, public swimming and fitness classes at leisure facilities across Highland, Moray, Orkney, The Western Isles, and Argyll and Bute.Ben Lamb, Director of Operations at Live Borders, said: ldquoWe have a commitment to people across the Borders being healthier, happier and stronger, and now this can apply to people visiting the Borders as well.ldquoWe are constantly looking for ways to widen the services offered to One Club members and the Leisure Link Partnership offers flexibility to locals and visitors alike.ldquoAs an organisation, we are very committed to collaborating, and the Leisure Link Partnership is an excellent opportunity for us to work in partnership with like-minded organisations as well as maximise benefits for our members.Many of the inidual Leisure Link Partnership sites will also offer access to other public sessions where cardholders can take part in many other activities such as running and indoor climbing.Visiting cardholders are advised to check out the Leisure Link Partnership section of their local centrersquos website to establish full access details.For more information on how to join visit https:www.liveborders.org.uk health leisure-link "},{"url":null,"title":"nursery-workers-cleared-cruelty-allegations","story":"TWO workers from a childrens nursery in the Borders accused of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner have been cleared following a long-running trial.Thirty five year old Teresa Renton and Nicola Jeffrey, who is , embraced each other in the dock when the not guilty verdict was announced at Selkirk Sherf Court.They had been charged with engaging in a course of conduct likely to cause fear and alarm at Little Reivers Nursery in Duns between January  and August , .The six-day trial heard a number of allegations labelled against the two women - who are both from Duns - regarding practices involving children in their care.But Sherf Raymond McMenamin questioned why the claims had never previously been reported until one worker - who was \"motivated to paint the worst possible picture of the accused\" - made a complaint against them in the summer of  and others then followed.Sherf McMenamin said that taking Rentons evidence alone - he described her as a good witness who was coherent and clear - there was scope for reasonable doubt and therefore a not guilty verdict must follow."},{"url":null,"title":"dreams-come-true-standard-bearer-ronan","story":"AS a young boy Ronan Caine sat amongst the audience in Innerleithenrsquos Memorial Hall and watched both his brothers and cousin being installed as Standard Bearer, dreaming that one day it would be him.For the boy named after the townrsquos Patron Saint, Ronan was destined to be the pride of Innerleithen.Only it was not with a crook in hand as the young Saint, it was to be many years later as a young man clutching St Ronanrsquos Blue Banner.The childhood dream became a reality on Friday, when he graced the stage and raised high the Blue Banner over fellow townsfolk as the Standard Bearer for .His moment in the spotlight came after outgoing Standard Bearer Jamie Boyd, ed it unsullied and untarnished to Games President Alan Patterson.Jamie managed to keep control of his emotions, but it was clear that the honour meant a great deal to him as he fought back the tears.\"I trust that I have carried out my duties of office to the satisfaction of my fellow townspeople.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"vigilante-leaving-soiled-nappies-bags-dog-poo-bid-keep-youths-woodland-spot","story":"The unusual tactic at the area known as The Jam Pot ndash within Lochend Woods ndash was revealed by police in Dunbar.Constable Gavin Ross said: ldquoSomebody has been disposing lots of bags of dog poo in that area, I think as a deterrent, and used nappies as well, which is not good.ldquoIf the youths are going to go somewhere, which they are, then it is an area we could keep an eye on them.The officer described the area of land, off Kellie Road, and what was happening.He said: ldquoIt is bare ground apart from the fact it is covered in broken glass.

UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king. It is a way of taking an ethical stance, and saying enough is enough. How to calculate what constitutes enough, of course ndash be it income, savings, love, leisure, charity, you name it ndash is even harder than measuring happiness.Read more: Scotlands history has lain in the British shadow for too long"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10212492.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dont-miss-fantastic-hidden-gems-throughout-angus-fife","story":"BalbinnyLooking for somewhere luxurious to stay in the Angus countryside  - then look no further than the stunning Balbinny.Situated in rolling farmland between the market towns of Forfar and Brechin, Balbinny benefits from -degree views across the River South Esk towards the Angus Glens, and onto the Cairngorms.A development of luxury self-catering accommodation all with master bedrooms featuring super king sized beds, flat screen televisions and bi-folding glass doors, treat yourself to luxury in the heart of the countryside.Complemented by an award winning swimming pool, spa and fitness suite - make the most of your stay by indulging in one of their therapeutic treatments.Tempted  ndash Grab pound off  nights or more between    -    and quote lsquoHeraldrsquo.Tel Email info@balbinnywww.balbinnywww.balbinny news-and-offerswww.facebook balbinnyInstagram balbinny-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Burntisland Golf ClubDating back to , the original Burntisland Golf Club is officially recognised as the tenth oldest golf club in the world.

I can honestly say we would have no le without him, she says. ldquoI trust him so much when I go out. I depend on him and I trust him.But her assistant is not a home carer or any kind of human support. Kaspa, who  year-old Glenys holds responsible for keeping Ken living in their own home, in Arbroath, is a black labrador. More importantly, he is a dementia dog.Nine years ago Ken Will, who is  was diagnosed with vascular dementia, and le quickly became desperate for Glenys. ldquoKen just wouldnrsquot accept it. He shut himself away and le was terrible, she says.She worked as a lollipop lady, but it increasingly became a struggle. ldquoI didnrsquot want to get up in the morning and in the evening I didnrsquot want to come home, she says. ldquoAnother three or four months and Irsquod have given up.The couple have been married for  years, but it looked as though Ken might have to go into some kind of residential care.ldquoThen we got word of people training dogs to work for people with dementia.

He fetches the post and he brings Kens medicine pouch when it is time to take pills.\" Hersquos Kenrsquos right hand man,\" Glenys adds.The Dementia Dogs scheme was a world first when it was pioneered in Scotland, as a partnership between two charities, Alzheimer Scotland and Dogs for Good, based in Banbury, Oxfordshire. It was initially the brainchild of a group of product design students from Glasgow School of Art.Since Kaspa became on of the first two dogs selected, it has supported  families across Scotland with highly trained assistance dogs to help people living with dementia.The dogs are trained in a iety of specialist tasks, from reminding someone to take their medication, to reducing anxiety and helping build confidence.When someone with dementia is out and about in the community, the dogs act as an icebreaker, helping counter the isolation often experienced by iniduals affected by the condition, and by their carers.The scheme doesnt just benefit dementia sufferers and their families. It was set up in partnership with the open prison Castle Huntly, which houses low risk prisoners nearing release. The prison provides a training room and outdoor space where dogs can be exercised and taught the specialist skills they need to help someone with dementia. Prisoners can sign up to participate and end up with qualications which can help them find jobs when they are released and ultimately mean they are much less likely to reoffend.Now the unique scheme is under threat, with funding coming to an end on August st and a campaign has been launched to raise over pound, to allow it to continue and expand. Although the two charities have pledged to find the funds to make sure families already supplied with dogs continue to be supported, no further families will ge able to benefit.Henry Simmons, Chief Executive of Alzheimer Scotland, said: ldquoWith over , people living with dementia in Scotland, almost every family now knows someone living with the illness. As the scale of dementia rises, we need new and innovative approaches to support people to live in their own homes and communities for longer.ldquoThe Dementia Dog project is a fantastic example of collaborative and pioneering working to develop dferent types of support for people living with dementia and we have been thrilled with its success over the past few years.\"The charities have launched an In the Picture campaign to help raise funds and make sure the option of a dementia dog is still part of the picture for families that could benefit from their support. \"I urge everyone to support to this incredibly important initiative to help make sure that no one faces dementia alone,\" Mr Simmons added."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-revenge-menu","story":"AS performers arrive in Edinburgh for the Fringe, comedian Lucy Porter has a look around town and remarks: \"I see that the Edinburgh restaurant Ive had a grudge against for  yearshas now closed.

Witnesses say they saw a number of gold miners ndash who want to expand their operation into new sections of the Amazon rainforest ndash enter the protected reserve of the Wajapi community and stab their leader to death.This is not an isolated incident, but the latest in a pattern of violence and intimidation. Intimidation that is intensying as a result of Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his policy of opening up the Amazon, the lungs of the planet, to further exploitation. The ancestral homes of the indigenous people are to be cleared.:Boris Johnson to chair first Brexit strategy meeting as no deal plans get poundbn boostWill today be the day we reach  degrees  That was the question being asked on news and TV outlets in the UK last week, just as mining assassins had struck down an indigenous leader in the ever more desperate and rapacious pursuit of profit.It is not a great leap to join these two dots. As the UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said, the mounting violence against indigenous communities is clearing the way for ldquofurther destruction of the rainforest, with all the scientically-established ramications that has for the exacerbation of climate change.As Emryarsquos bloodied body was dumped in a river, a message was being sent. Move off these lands, or die. And with the death of the flourishing of these forests, the climate emergency ratchets up.Bolsonaro is keen to steam roller new tracts of the Amazon. As the director of the Amazon Watch Program, Christian Poirer has said, ldquohis regimersquos reckless policies and its wanton neglect of threatened forest communities is directly linked to rising violent criminality. When he is accused of pursuing mass deforestation, and of covering up for the violence against the peoples living in the Amazon, he simply says it is a lie.But he also wants to disarm criticism ndash in a dictatorial fashion. Since coming to power, he has dismantled government departments who focus on climate change. He has promoted climate change deniers to the highest offices.As soon as he came to power, he signed an executive order that handed the regulation of protected Amazonian lands to the Agricultural Ministry, which is dominated by agri-business interests.Bolsonaro has also displayed a long track record of anti-indigenous sentiment, once commenting: ldquoItrsquos a shame that the Brazilian cavalry wasnrsquot as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated their Indians.The disaster being visited upon Brazilrsquos , indigenous people is a disaster for the world. This is one consequence of the election of Bolsonaro.Last year, I went to Rio and Sao Paulo during the election to speak to activists and to report back to meetings in Scotland on the situation there. I met with campaigners and watched the results come in with hundreds of Fernando Haddad supporters, the candidate up against Bolsonaro. People held on to one another as it became clear, as expected, that Bolsonaro was going to win.:Boris Johnson accused of bias toward DUP on Northern Ireland visitThe very next day, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Sao Paulo and cities across Brazil. In an act of courageous defiance, they made clear they would resist the new regime.I spoke to activists about their plans. ldquoThe initial task is to survive, so we are organising solidarity networks, said one. This response was unsurprising. Attacks against LGBT people were a result of the huge propaganda effort waged by the Bolsonaro campaign.Marrielle Franco, a left-wing councillor in Rio, was shot dead months before. Her face now adorns walls across the city as a reminder of the violence of the forces of reaction in Brazil, as well as resistance unbowed in the face of aggression.I noted two days after the election: ldquoGunmen have attacked an indigenous Bororo village in Mato Grosso do Sul. The attackers destroyed the whole village. This is to clear the way for mining and logging. Clearances for the corporations to move in.Thus, the response from the boardrooms and the ideologues of global capitalism to the election of Bolsonaro was quite dferent from that of the rainforest defenders. The Wall Street Journal backed him to the hilt. He was the choice of the international markets. And more recently, the EU struck a Mercosur trade deal that is catastrophic for the environment. The deal negotiated by the European Commission, has been lauded as historic by Bolsonaro.The deal sees a trade in ldquocows for cars, whereby the EU gains access to markets for cars and other products and services with eliminated export taxes, infor Mercosur countries gaining access to markets for beef, sugar and other goods.Cattle farming is the single biggest contributor to the deforestation of the rain forest. Some  per cent of deforested areas in the Amazon are a result of commercial animal pastures.

In this century David Cameron and Theresa May have fronted UK governments that have, unashamedly, put the interests of their party first and protected those with vested interests at the expense of wealth distribution and fairness. With Boris Johnson at the helm there are signs that the doctrine of conscience-free libertarianism will be further emboldened following a No Deal Brexit which will cripple the country and the vast majority of its people but buttress the wealthy both economically and politically.Dominic Cummings, senior adviser to Mr Johnson, very recently said that, in the view of the public, Tories do not care about poor people or the NHS. Whilst this statement could well be another part of his grand election strategy to stimulate debate, it is nonetheless true that societal isions have been accentuated under the Conservatives.Ms Sturgeon has introduced a Benthamite dimension to the national discourse at a time when clarity is most required regarding the nature of our values and what sort of country we wish to live in. She will, almost certainly, come in for criticism from political opponents for hypocrisy or idealism or both.A genuinely Utilitarian society may be a Nirvana in many ways, but it is greatly encouraging that we have a First Minister who possesses the ability to convey her vision, display her humanity and provide sound leadership at this juncture of unprecedented national crisis.The well-being and happiness of Scotland may well rest on her guidance in the weeks and months to come.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE letter from James Martinis one of the best examples I have encountered of the use of the word hyperbole. We have ldquocringeworthy, whinging, victim persona, suffer, hate-filled, nationalist faces, screaming, foul mouthed, abuse, misappropriated Saltire, intolerant, ignorance, wanton display of boorishness, nationalist, nasty creed. My goodness, what side of bed did Mr Martin arise from that day The cause of this unmerited fury is the performance of Ian Blackford at Westminster and the crowd outside Bute House for the visit of Boris Johnson. I would commend to Mr Martin several viewings on the BBC Parliament channel of Scottish Questions at Westminster, where he will see behaviour from the non-SNP benches to which most of the above words could be applied, so in addition to hyperbole I see hypocrisy.The visit to Bute House by the PM has been well reported and televised by the media and is still available. After several viewings myself, I see an orderly crowd protesting with the booing being louder than the cheering and all in very close proximity to the PM and FM. What were the police thinking about in letting ldquohate-filled nationalists from both sides so close I take particular issue on Mr Martinrsquos comment on the waving of the ldquomisappropriated Saltire. The Saltire cannot be misappropriated by anyone, it is the flag of Scotland and may be used by those who wish to use it. That the SNP and independence supporters use it is perfectly natural. The fact that Scottish Unionists and especially the ldquoProud Scot iety choose not to, is their decision. We hear about Scottish Unionists rooting for Scotland too and so they should, but the Unionist peg is so shoogly they cannot bring themselves to wave the flag of their home country in ldquoour precious Union ndash shame on them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.I WOULD point out to James Martin that the demonstration in Edinburgh was a peaceful one which left Boris Johnson in no doubt of the strength of feeling regarding Scotlands desire to remain within the EU, and the ultimate horror of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Martin reminds us that the new Prime Minister wasnt \"duly elected other than by a coterie of like-minded iniduals\" but that \"in the UK system the party given the majority chooses who will be PM, not the electorate\". Indeed, but Scotland hasnt chosen a Conservative government since the s, and as Scotland has but  MPs, Wales , Northern Ireland  and England , it is clear that under the UK system everyone gets the governments England elects, and Scotland is facing the unpalatable prospect of leaving the EU because England voted to leave. An affront to democracy which deserves to be protested against.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE SNP and their apologists tell us on an almost-daily basis that Scotland did not vote for a Conservative government. Figures for the  Holyrood elections and  general elections show that SNP votes were . per cent and . per cent respectively indicating that the majority of Scots voters didnrsquot vote for an SNP Government. They complain that Scots didnrsquot vote for Boris Johnson, conveniently forgetting that Nicola Sturgeon was not voted in by the Scottish voters but simply took over from Alex Salmond when he stepped down after losing the  Independence referendum. The same people tell us that Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will. The EU referendum was a UK-wide vote with the result being binding on all parts of the UK. The SNP doesnrsquot accept this.In the  independence referendum  out of  Scottish council areas voted no to independence, so by applying SNP logic it would be reasonable for those council areas voting no in any future referendum to be allowed to remain within the UK. Then again the SNP does not do logic: but it does hypocrisy and cant extremely well.Donald Lewis, Gford, East Lothian.I WONDERit has occurred to Nicola Sturgeon and her party that the reason why they no longer have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and lost so many seats at Westminster is because the Scottish electorate do not agree with their policies, especially that of seeking to break up the UK.Most people are now weary of reading in the newspapers, and hearing on radio and television of the latest rants and moans from Nicola Sturgeon et al.It would not surprise meBoris Johnson found his recent visit to the RN nuclear submarine base at Faslane less grim than that to Bute House.Robert I G Scott, Fe."},{"url":null,"title":"m-middle-class-working-class-roots","story":"The first came from Stacey Dooley, Glitterball winner and documentary maker, the Luton council house girl with no qualications who used to shoplt on Saturdays.

The Scottish Government has been more ambitious and pledged to meet net zero emissions by . This ambition is reinforced in the Scottish Government Climate Change Bill by a target of % reduction in carbon emissions by . So, the challenge for us all is how will we meet these targets Renewables can supply up to % of Scotlandrsquos electricity, but that is just a fraction of our total energy usage.In June , the Royal Society of Edinburgh , Scotlandrsquos National Academy, launched the final report of its major Inquiry into Scotlandrsquos Energy Future. The two-year project had a goal of assessing the pros and cons of the options available to meet Scotlandrsquos energy needs. This allowed a committee of independent experts to take evidence from a wide range of stakeholders including an open call for written evidence, public engagement events across Scotland, and numerous meetings with government, industry and third sector organisations. The report considers Scotlandrsquos current energy landscape, analysis of the future options available to meet energy demand, and the governance of our energy system.The RSE Energy Inquiry report makes a number of recommendations.However, perhaps its most important point is that there is no silver bullet. , Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette Webb\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Committee Members, Sir Muir Russell, Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette Webb\" class\"editor-image\"Committee Members, Sir Muir Russell, Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette WebbThere are no easy answers to the enormous challenge we face. If we cannot signicantly reduce energy demand, which must clearly be a government priority, we may need to double or even treble our low-carbon electricity production. For example, current government policy aims to reduce carbon emissions from transportation by switching to electric vehicles. However, while such a move is certainly necessary, it is not sufficient.The additional electricity required to power our electric cars must somehow be produced, and by low carbon methods .One option to reduce carbon emissions from domestic heating is to convert all our heating systems to run on hydrogen gas. However, based on current technologies, we can only produce sufficient hydrogen by manufacturing it from methane, a process which produces carbon dioxide.Hence, we would still need to invest in technologies for capturing and storing the carbon dioxide. This may prove expensive, so who should pay  Scotland already has a high percentage of households in fuel poverty ndash % in .Read more about our Climate For Change initiative in Business HQ, online every quarterFuture energy policy must consider a wide range of possibilities within the framework of the ldquoenergy quadrilemma ndash climate change, affordability, energy security, and providing energy in a just and sustainable way.Dficult decisions are unavoidable and must be made by our elected officials in a transparent and honest way one which looks at Scotlandrsquos needs, and its social and ethical responsibilities in the round, and decides what the best energy mix should be.The danger of not meeting the challenge head-on is that Scotland, and the wider UK, do not produce enough energy to meet future requirements and rely increasingly on importing energy from overseas. When we import energy, which already accounts for % of UK primary supply, we have no control over its carbon footprint, nor over the ethics, social justice and environmental impacts at the point of its production. We also leave ourselves vulnerable to major geopolitical crises that could result in energy shortages.One of the primary outcomes of the RSE Energy Inquiry is the need to raise the level of informed, evidence-based discussion around energy policy and its impacts. Too often debate on how we source and use energy focuses narrowly on inidual technologies and theirdrawbacks.Public opinion is also influenced by the ldquonot in my back yard problem of not siting production sites near people.As we look to meeting this global challenge, an important facet of ldquodoing things dferently should be to facilitate a wider and more meaningful discussion on why we need energy, how we use it and from where we source it. There will be no perfect or easy solution. Decisions will inevitably have consequences, and signicant financial investment will unquestionably be required, but these realities cannot be allowed to hinder the mature and considered debate that is needed.To this end, a key recommendation of the RSE report is the establishment of an independent expert advisory commission on energy policy and governance. If given the requisite authority and resources, such a commission would provide the Scottish Government, legislators and regulators with integrated and impartial advice. It could also address related areas such as fuel poverty, climate change mitigation, economic development, environmental protection, planning, transport, community development and public health.An independent, credible and trusted body providing this sort of guidance could play a key role in strengthening public and political discourse on energy.Professor Rebecca Lunn is Deputy Chair, Royal Society of Edinburgh Energy Inquiry, University of StrathclydeThe HeraldrsquosClimate for Changeinitiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

Not only were the team from VisitScotland a great bunch to work with but the countryside we crossed in pursuit of our payload is one of the most beautul and dramatic landscapes we’ve visited. “Once the Coosmonaut was back in our hands, we were genuinely sad to leave and head back to England.”A new tourism map highlighting Scotland’s links to space exploration and the first moonwalk has also been released.On the new trail...among the Scottish landmarks on the new VisitScotland map is the dark sky observatory in Dalmellington, Ayrshire.The Scotland is Out of this World trail is part of the new VisitScotland campaign of the same name.The trail features Scottish connections to each planet in the solar system, as well as fun facts and details of science centres and the best places to stargaze.Highlights incude:data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.gallowaygazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"Mars – Glenelg, Highlands: In  the village twinnedwith a geological feature on Mars, called Glenelg.Jupiter – Loch Airigh, Isle of Harris: The loch in the Outer Hebrides portrays the planet Jupiter in the  Stanley Kubrick directed film, : A Space Odyssey.Uranus – Braemar: The birthplace of Johann von Lamont, an astronomer who calculated the mass of Uranus.Neptune – Jedburgh, Scottish Borders: The birthplace of th century science writer Mary Somerville who theorised that dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus may point to an undiscovered planet, which inspired the discovery of Neptune.Venus – Parton, Dumfries and Galloway: The resting place of th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, whose name was given to Maxwell Montes, the planet’s only feature named after a man.The Scotland is Out of this World campaign marks the th anniversary of the Apollo  mission and US astronaut Neil Armstrong’s historic walk on the lunar surface.But it also celebrates the th anniversary of VisitScotland.Malcolm Roughead, chief executive, said: “For  years VisitScotland has helped position Scotland as a must-visit destination to audiences across the world.“It is therefore fitting that in our anniversary year we set our sights even further and travelled into space in what can only be described as a truly out of this world campaign.“Scotland is Out of this World offered the opportunity to delve into the past and celebrate the country’s contribution to space exploration and its ancestral links to one of the greatest moments in history.“The new trail reveals some of the country’s stellar attractions and locations to visit to firmly cement Scotland’s place in astro-tourism. “After all, our best views aren’t confined to our awe-inspiring landscapes but reach up high into the night sky above as well.”Ohio-born Neil Armstrong was proud of his Scottish heritage.

We have already asked all our members to start collecting empty crisp packets and are setting up a collection point in our Scout Hut.“We will be collecting all crisp packets including large bags and the multi pack bags as well as popcorn and other snacks bags.“We think that now is an ideal time for our members to start collecting as over the summer holidays people have more picnics and snacks especially in this gorgeous weather. “Inverurie Scout Group can’t wait to see how many we get when our section meetings start up again in August..The group has appealed to the local community to join in and drop-off off collections at the Scout Hut at section meetings duringterm-time.

They must be allowed to remain so.“Scotland faces plenty of health challenges and I suggest that we focus on those rather than getting side-tracked by a suggestion like this which is obviously going nowhere”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These would be in place for up to three years, although it is unlikely that they would be required for thisof time.The equipment used on the met masts gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.Orkney Islands Council announced in April that is was intending to investigate an additional two sites for potential community wind farms in the county — to add to the project already under investigation on Hoy.The new sites under consideration are located at Faray, in the North Isles, and at Quanterness in St Ola. The aim of the project, which is being led by the OIC#s strategic projects team, would be to generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney.Sweyn Johnston, the council’s strategic projects director, said: “Applying for planning permission for the #met masts# is the latest stage in further investigating the sites we have identied and have been discussing with folk at drop-in events over the last few months. Installing #met masts# would allow data to be gathered which could be critical in determining how we move forward with the project.”For more information visit the Planning Application Search and Submission page on the OIC website• For the Quanterness planning application search for   PP.• For the Hoy planning application search for   PP.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

It was by no means certain they would get it – with  per cent having their requests turned down – and the average payout was £. One of the main reasons for applications was that people had spent their benefits or income and run out of money.Everyone has a personal responsibility to live within their means and the state simply cannot afford to fund the lestyles of prodigal citizens who refuse to do so and there is always likely to be a small minority of claimants who try to game the system. But the vast majority of cases will be genuine.: Boris Johnson tries to turn focus from Brexit with pledges to boost northern EnglandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereEver since the  crash, there has been growing concern about in-work poverty with some employers paying below the ‘living wage’ – effectively relying on their staff to claim ‘top-up’ benefits, which could be seen as a form of state subsidy for people’s wages, or get a second or even a third job.The growing discontent about standards of living – not just among the poorest – is a serious problem that must be addressed by politicians of all parties. The failure to do so was undoubtedly one reason for the Brexit referendum result. Boris Johnson’s announcement in Manchester of £. billion for ‘left-behind towns’ may be seen as a populist move, but it was at least a recognition of the need for action. The mere acknowledgement that some places have been “left behind” will be welcomed by many who feel exactly this way.But, ultimately, this is a serious problem that is unlikely to be solved by major spending projects by government – whether at Holyrood or Westminster – but by improving the economic performance of the country as a whole. And governments – at local, Scottish and UK level – have a vital role to play in ensuring this happens and duty to co-operate with each other to this end.So it was disappointing that the immediate reaction to the Welfare Fund figures was an attempt to sht blame. Our politicians need to work together to solve this country’s problems, whether they are ones of high finance or more mundane concerns, like the cost of nappies for an infant.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"what scottish unionists can learn from decline of quebec s separatists murdo fraser","story":"Quebec demonstrates that it is possible for unionists to see off an independence movement evenit seems unstoppable, writes Murdo Fraser.It is always useful to look at international and historical comparisons for the challenges we face in Scotland today. One part of the world that has faced similar constitutional issues to ours is the largely Francophone province of Quebec, which held two referendums on the question of independence , in  and . Whilst on both occasions the vote went against separation, in  it did so by the tightest of margins, with just one per cent between the winning and losing totals.Since , however, the notion of independence for Quebec has slipped down the political agenda, with a collapse in support both for it as a concept, and for the separatist Parti Quebecois.In the most recent provincial election last October, the once-dominant PQ secured just  per cent of the vote, with the winner being the soft-nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec .What explains this turnaround in little more than  years  Simply, Quebecers tired of the constitutional argument. A younger generation in the province, still proud of their Quebec heritage, became more comfortable with the notion of being Canadian, secure in the view that a strong federal system protected local decision-making.There is little doubt that the constitutional debates had an economic impact. The banking centre of Canada moved from Montreal to Toronto, largely due to concerns over Quebec separation. A legacy of those times is the irony that today the Bank of Montreal is headquartered not in the city whose name it bears, but in English-speaking Toronto.The debate over Quebec’s future had consequences too for the local electoral landscape. With a first-past-the-post voting system, there was little point in the federalist, pro-Canada parties splitting the anti-separatist vote any more than was necessary. : Nicola Sturgeon challenges Boris Johnson to live TV debate on independenceFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo the Conservative Party of Canada, despite its electoral successes at a federal level, does not contest elections to the Quebec National Assembly. Instead, Quebec Conservatives vote for the Quebec Liberal Party, which despite its name has been independent of the Canadian Liberals – the party of Justin Trudeau – since , and sits somewhat to their right on economic issues.These arrangements are perhaps best illustrated in the long career of the Quebec politician Jean Charest. Charest started his journey as a Conservative in Canada’s federal Parliament in Ottawa, serving as leader of the party there from  to . Then, on the invitation of the Quebec Liberals, he left the federal Parliament – and the Canada Conservatives – to become the provincial Liberal leader, in which position he went on to be elected as Premier of Quebec. He served in that role from -, winning an unprecedented three election victories.While the notion of dferent political parties at dferent levels might seem unusual to us, it is the norm across Canada. Centre-right, pro-Canada Quebecers have no dficulty in voting one way in a federal election, and quite dferently in a provincial one.So what might we in Scotland learn from all this  Firstly, there is nothing inevitable about independence or constitutional change. It might have seemed to Quebecers in the s that nothing would stop the separatist juggernaut, but the voters simply tired of the constitutional debate.Voter fatigue is something we are becoming familiar with. My sense of where we are with Brexit is that there is a growing demand that politicians “just get it over with”. There is little appetite to re-open the independence question here while the Brexit question is still unresolved, and even then I wonder whether the public will be enthusiastic about yet another round of constitutional debate.Secondly, we should not assume that our current political party structures are either optimal, or set to last for ever. Boris Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister has reignited the debate over whether there should be a separate Scottish Conservative Party, an idea I put forward in  when I stood for the party leadership .Notwithstanding my views on the issue at that time, to me the notion that we should split from the Conservative Party as a reaction to Boris’s election as UK leader is as daft an idea as the SNP’s claim that this is an argument for independence. The Union has lasted for more than  years, it has been substantially to the benefit of Scotland to have been part of it for that time, both economically and socially, and to dismantle it as a knee-jerk response to the identity of any one holder of the office of Prime Minister, and lose these advantages as a consequence, would be ridiculous.Moreover,Boris can deliver an orderly Brexit, he may well end up governing the UK as a true One-Nation Conservative. A look at his record in office as mayor of London suggests that is entirely possible, and some of his early announcements – for example on dropping his predecessor’s misguided immigration targets – have been warmly welcomed by Scottish Conservatives.I understand the concerns of Conservative colleagues who don’t want to change our relationship with the UK party. I also appreciate that I have MP colleagues who want to be part of a bigger team, and feel that their constituents should have the right to vote directly for the party of Government in a Westminster election. But,we were to adopt a Canadian model of political parties, that would all still be possible. The key battleground ahead for us is  – the Scottish Parliament elections – where a victory for the SNP with a majority of seats at Holyrood for pro-independence parties will lead to them claiming a mandate for a second referendum. The priority for unionists, of all parties, must be to defeat them in that objective.The lesson of politics in Quebec is that when the forces of federalism come together they can see off the threat of separation. If it worked there, it could work here. At least we should be considering whether the Canadian approach is one we can learn from.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh hotels urged to offer free stays to fringe performers","story":"Organisers of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe want the city#s hotels to offer free and discounted hotel rooms to artists to help slash the soaring costs of appearing in shows at the event.Fringe Society chief executive Shona McCarthy also called for cafes, bars and restaurants to offer Fringe workers discounts rather than see the event as a “cash cow”.She has urged businesses to take an “altruistic” view of the event in future rather than see it as an excuse to hike normal prices every August.: The Edinburgh Festival Fringe :  must-see ing showsMs McCarthy, who cites the cost of accommodation as the biggest single barrier to taking part in the Fringe, said “inroads” were already being made with the hotel sector after they were asked to provide more help for the event.Ms McCarthy, who was appointed in , has previously warned that the event is at risk of becoming “unaffordable” for participants and called for a city-wide commitment to balance the “delicate eco-system” which makes the Fringe happen each year.The Fringe Society has secured more than  discounted university rooms for performers after talks with the sector, while several hundred private home-owners have also agreed to host artists after an appeal earlier this year.Ms McCarthy said the Fringe was under “huge pressure” to ensure it could continue to boast of being “the most accessible festival in the world” and had played its part by ensuring the cost of entry to its programme and box office commissions were kept as low as possible.She urged any business which benefits from the Fringe, which is believed to generate more than £ million for the economy, to consider putting something back into the event and suggested it was valued more overseas than it is in Edinburgh.Ms McCarthy said: “We would absolutely love the hotel sector to come to the party in a big way. We would ask them for two things – an allocation of a number of free rooms for artists and performers and also some rooms on a reduced rate. “We’d love itevery single hotel in the city considered allocating some rooms to artists and performers. It’s not just the top hotels in the city that benefit from the Fringe. We’ve been speaking to a lot of them and are beginning to make real inroads.”“If you look right across the landscape you see that prices for everything go up in August.“We would love to see all businesses in the city have special deals for the artists, performers, creatives and support workers who come to the Fringe to acknowledge that they are the driving force and the rocket fuel of this festival. “We’d basically like to see businesses provide  per cent off to anyone who is wearing a Fringe lanyard.”: Edinburgh International Festival:  musical highlights for Ms McCarthy said she wanted to make a direct plea to all businesses who were “tempted to hike their prices up more than normal” to consider what they could do to help make the event more affordable for participants.She added: “This is an unsubsidised arts festival, where the performers and artists and creative entrepreneurs who set up the venues are the people who take the risks to make the Fringe happen.“There is a huge pressure on the Fringe and everybody involved in it to continue to be the most accessible festival in the world and ensure it remains affordable. There is a real collective commitment to that.“Our call-out to businesses is for everyone who benefits from the Fringe in some way to have some recognition of that and realise that it is not never-ending. “My messages to businesses would be to remind them that the Fringe is an extraordinary thing for Edinburgh and Scotland. It literally brings the focus of the world on to this city for a month every August in an incredibly positive way.“I’m still blown away at how phenomenal the Fringe is in terms of promoting Scotland as an open, international, creative and outward-thinking place. People should see the Fringe as something they should really invest in. “What it does for the city and the country can only really be appreciated when you go to other places and talk to people there.”Russell Imrie, spokesman for the Edinburgh Hotels Association, said: “The financial model of hotels is based on a full year’s performance, not one month’s trading in isolation. “The Edinburgh tourism year is very seasonal from periods of high demand to periods of very low demand. Hotels need buoyant trading months to support months of the year when they trade at a financial loss. Pricing of all travel related products is based on supply and demand. Prices are higher in periods of high demand and lower in periods of low demand. Higher prices in August are balanced by very low prices in low season. Hotel pricing methodology is in line with all other travel businesses.“However, hotels are independent businesses who will make their own decisions. “If a hotel is financially able to offer additional support it will do so, but a unorm scheme across all hotels in the city could not be supported as it would not be financially sustainable for some hotels.”Garry Clark, development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The city’s small local businesses are keen to join in the celebrations around our annual festivals and value the cultural and economic contribution they provide to Edinburgh. “As always, pricing is guided by supply and demand but we know from last year’s experience that increased competition in the accommodation market has led some providers to lower the cost of rooms, even during the festival ­period.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational mum completes 10 000 mile charity trek to australia with no money","story":"A Scottish mum model has completed a , mile charity across the globe to Australia solely relying on the kindness of strangers.Mum-of-two Elaine Harris, , made her way to Sydney - all thanks to kind strangers who helped her get there from the UK.Elaine, who found catwalk success as a finalist on the UKs Top Model, started her epic freebie adventure on a tractor, leaving her home in Forfar, Angus on Sunday, July .She journeyed to Germany, Czechoslovakia, Israel, Bangkok, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Kuala Lumpur before arriving in Sydney - all with no cash.The mum to Salina, six, and Ariana, two, celebrated the end of her -day challenge by climbing up the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge, despite being exhausted.The intrepid catwalk queen has had to survive on one meal a day and protein bars and relied on the generosity of others to get her through the gruelling trip.She had to ration water and the charge on her phone while she bravely hitchhiked for lts on the back of lorries.Elaine said the hardest part was sleep deprivation and a  hour bus journey from Bangkok to Vietnam via Siem Reap, Cambodia.Elaine said: \"When I was starting the challenge I had no idea what to carry.\"How do you pack for somewhere that you dont know \"I took ten protein bars and I ate them all.\"Im so grateful for them, I was having one meal a day and a protein bar.: Scots more charitable than rest of UK \"I had to ration everything.\"I rationed water, food and even the charge on my phone.\"When people gave you food or anything you would just appreciate it.\"I wouldnt ask them to give me stuff but once I got chatting to people they would help but it was all very genuine.\"Some people would give me money for food.\"Hitching for the lorries was terrying.\"My heart was in my mouth but I honestly didnt come across anything negative within the ten days.\"By day three, the whole challenge just blew up and everyone got behind me through social media.\"It was so cool to start at with a tractor in Scotland and end up in Australia.\"The whole journey has been surreal.\": Work of charity leads to £k donation to fight Crohns She travelled from Dundee to Glasgow on the back of a motorbike before hitching a lt with a trucker to Dover where she got the ferry onto Calais.Elaine arrived in Brussels on Tuesday where she hitch-hiked to Lohr Am Main in Baia, Germany.From there she took a -hour bus journey from Bangkok to Vietnam via Siem Reap, Cambodia, where she got a lt on a tuk tuk.She flew from Kuala Lumpur to Syndey.Elaine said: \"The lack of sleep and food was probably the hardest thing for me.\"I was relying on people to feed me because I was in transit the whole entire time.\"I think I went through seven days without having a proper bed to sleep on.\"Elaine took on the challenge to raise funds for a clinic to provide dental and eye care to kids on the isle of Sal, in Cape Verde, off the coast of West Africa.The inspirational mum said: \"I thought about doing something were you take a chance on people being good.\"I felt like most stories that are reported are about the dangers in the world so I thought of something which will show the good in people.\"My kids are really proud of me and my eldest worked in the clinic with me so shes very aware of the work we do.\"Shes full of empathy.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site.

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry.

Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon. It gave us a chance to get together after the event and share stories about Joe. It was so lovely.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup mla says rathfriland water tower flags very tastefully done","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Either you support the rule of law or you don’t. Jim needs to make up his mind,\" the South Down MLA “I also note that Mr Wells claims to have spoken with those responsible.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

However, Im not surprised, as for some considerable time I have endured parliamentary answers coming from the NIO where one asks a question and is not given a straightforward answer.\"We have had to put up with this during the tenure of the last three Secretaries of State and its largely why I decided to reveal the depth of conspiracy that exists in the NIO. There is no one accountable in the NIO, and that is from the topdown.\"Referring to the latest NIO decision to remove all photographs, he added: \"There is also a groundswell of absolute disgust, not just in Northern Ireland but also in Parliament, over the insulting behaviour by senior civil servants and its something that Im not going to put up with.\" Lord Maginnis said in light of yesterday developments, it was clear that senior civil servants would need \"fundamental retraining\".UUP leader Robin Swann raised the matter with the Prime Minister during his visit to Stormont House yesterday and said Boris Johnson \"looked puzzled\" when told there is no portrait of the Queen on the walls.Lord Empey, who was among the UUP delegation, said: \"He clearly wasnt aware of it... he was clearly a bit surprised, is how I would put it.\"There was no definitive response from him, but the matter was squarely laid on the table and we shall see what emerges.\"I think both he and the new Secretary of State will be on a steep learning curve to understand the nuances of Northern Ireland.\" Lord Empey said he \"does not think it is unreasonable\" for a portrait of the head of state to hang on the walls of a Government department.\"I think many people would have been shocked that this matter has arisen at all. Its rather bizarre, to put it mildly,\" he added.South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan said the \"shameful decision\" by the NIO had caused \"grave offence\" and further represented the \"hurt and growing anger at the continuing war on Britishness being exercised by republicans\".Mr Girvan said: \"The revelation that the NIO has banned all portraits of the Queen from their buildings is grossly offensive and disrespectful to many people here in Northern Ireland.\"This spineless decision by NIO mandarins, and many others used to erode our British identity in this part of the United Kingdom, is the outworking of the so-called equality agenda that lies at the heart of the Belfast Agreement, heralded as the Trojan horse to break unionists by Gerry Adams.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said the stripping of all royal photographs and portraits from Stormont House was \"shameful\" and something that needed to be addressed urgently by the new Secretary of State.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath said Northern Ireland has many more important and pressing matters to be paying attention to, such as Brexit and re-establishing the Executive.He added: \"Those matters being resolved would do more to improve relations here than the putting up and taking down of pictures.\"We are not going to be in a good position whenever we are weaponising symbols and pictures here - that means we have got to a very dangerous place.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said his party had \"no issue with portraits of the Queen being tactfully and tastefully placed in what is a Government building\".The Equality Commission said it was unable to comment on inidual cases.A spokesperson added: \"The Equality Commission has, for many years, given advice to employers on issues around the wearing or display of emblems in the workplace, and the implications this can have for maintaining good and harmonious relations.\"Tribunal decisions have identied some practices that are or may be unacceptable.\"However, each case needs to be dealt with on its own facts.\"The commission recognises that it is important to reflect on the purpose andof an organisation.\"However, it would not be acceptable for such an environment to be threatening, hostile or unwelcome for employees.\""},{"url":null,"title":"political parties declare 160000 euro","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But it’s practically impossible to recruit, train and deploy Border Force staff in  days.“The PAC will continue to look beyond the bluster at the facts, the delivery and follow how taxpayers money is spent. We’ll also be probing how much of this is new funding rather than the release of previously earmarked funding.”The SNP’s Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins described the cash as a “”shameful waste of money” and “rather than working to avert a catastrophic no-deal exit, Boris Johnson is accelerating over the economic clf-edge”.£.bn spent to make sure we still have medicine after October st, instead of invested in our public services.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health.

Our tourism offer in the region is steadily growing and this new £m investment by Holiday Inn adds another great hotel to our growing list and provides more choice for visitors.“The creation of  new jobs in the process is a great boost for the city, not to mention the wider benefits that will be felt in the local supply chain.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group ready support development north west institution","story":"The Derry University Group has said it is willing to “advise and support” the local council in establishing an independent university in the city.A meeting was held between Council Chief Executive John Kelpie, Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, and the new Secretary of State for NI this week where the ongoing campaign for a Medical school at Magee was discussed.The Derry University Groupfelt it was a prime opportunity to impress upon SoS Julian Smith the need for an independent university in the city.This month, Derry City  Strabane District Councillors unanimously backed a motion supporting the exploration of all options for university provision in the North West. That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past. Of course we also need a Medical School for the North West as part of any new university, but it is only a very small part of a much bigger picture.“We need a minimum of , additional students in this city.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"powys new head education appointed","story":"Dr Caroline Turner the new chief executive of Powys County Council, takes the heltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlm on February .lt spangtlt spangt\" POWYS: Has new head of education been appointed Head of education, Dr Alec Clark\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"removing complication","story":"Be more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitBe more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitGet your training off to a great start with this special offer.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"burglary llanidloes see hear anything","story":"Library image of police tape\" Burglary in Llanidloes – did you see or hear anything Library image of police tape\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

He was taken to Downe Hospital where he died five hours later.The other two soldiers were taken to the Ulster Hospital at Dundonald and placed in intensive care where they are seriously ill. The driver of the Escort was taken to Downe Hospital and detained with two broken lefts and a broken arm. Passengers in a third vehicle were treated for shock.The dead man and his two colleagues were due to leave the province for Gibtraltar hours later, his parents in Sunderland were told shortly afterwards.The blackspot has claimed four victims, the most recent being less than five years ago when a  year-old youth died.

He was looking around on each side of him for some guidance and then the only contribution was that some civil servant said it was ‘a personnel matter’. But clearly he was not aware of it and seemed genuinely surprised.“My hope and expectation is that he’ll find out about the details but I’d think it’s quite a hard sell to defend what has happened where you have a UK government office where the picture of the head of state is not permitted to be displayed.“If you go to an American government office, President Trump’s picture will be on display,you go to an Irish government building you will see the picture of the Irish president – and rightly so. This whole thing is bonkers.”The News Letter first asked the NIO questions about the issue on Monday morning. Despite several reminders, the NIO did not respond until late on Tuesday night, after appearing to carefully consider its response – yet the brief response avoided answering the questions.Emergency council meeting called over Harland and Wolff shipyard crisis Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Throughout yesterday, as the story was picked up by the Nolan Show, the Frank Mitchell Show and the Belfast , the NIO refused to offer any substantive comment and did not dispute the accuracy of the News Letter story.Then last night, within minutes of BBC Newsline reporting on the controversy, the NIO released a statement from Secretary of State Julian Smith. In it he said that he was “delighted to see a picture of Her Majesty in my office when I arrived at Stormont House for the first time”.The NIO later claried that his first day in Stormont House was last Friday.The News Letter spoke to a well-placed source who last night expressed “utter surprise” when told about what Mr Smith had said.Last week UUP peer Lord Rogan had tabled parliamentary questions about the issue.When the NIO was asked by this newspaper whether the Queen’s picture had suddenly reappeared in Mr Smith’s office as recently as last week, an NIO spokesman said that he did not know.Mr Smith’s comments contradict those of NIO minister Lord Duncan. Last week, in answer to a written House of Lords question from Lord Rogan, he said that in line with advice from the Equality Commission the NIO was sensitive to the display of “posters, pictures, portraits or other displays that are more closely associated with one or other of the communities”, a phrase which includes the Queen, and added: “I can confirm that the department takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House.”TUV leader Jim Allister said that the situation needed to be “addressed urgently” by Mr Smith. DUP MP Paul Girvan said that the NIO’s decision was “grossly offensive and disrespectful to many people here in Northern Ireland”.It is not yet clear whether the portraits were removed because that was necessary under equality law or whether the NIO went far beyond what the law demands.However, in an indication of how the decision has the potential to undermine support for equality laws, Mr Girvan characterised the decision as “the outworking of the so-called ‘equality agenda’ that lies at the heart of the Belfast Agreement”.Last night Ulster-born Labour MP Kate Hoey said that “all the other pictures of Her Majesty must be put back” and said the episode raised questions for the NIO’s top official, Sir Jonathan Stephens.try catch  TrendingUpdated: PSNI probe sudden death of teenagerManarrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child arrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child\"N.I. mankilled in serious road traffic collision killed in serious road traffic collision\"Three vehicle road traffic collision -

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

focused  ","story":"A family have spoken of their pride after their son defied the odds to graduate from Ulster University#s Magee campus.Joel Emerson, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, graduated with a . in Business Information Systems on July .The -year-old attended Ceara School in Lurgan for two years before transferring to Richmount Primary on the Moy Road and then to Donacloney Primary to finish his primary education.Praising the educators who supported her son in his early years, Joel’s mother Rhonda said: “When Joel started Ceara, he didn’t have many communication skills. After his two years there his communication skills had improved and he was able to move into mainstream education. He’d been introduced to the schedule system and this helped immensely.“Joel received support from a classroom assistant at Richmount and also when he moved to Donacloney. Joel then moved to Dromore High. He worked hard in his GCSEs and A levels and was able to go on to study at Magee. We’re very proud of what he has achieved.”Although Joel’s graduation was a chance to celebrate his educational successes, it was also an emotional day for the family. Rhonda added: “My mother Margaret Boyd passed away before Joel’s graduation. She had bought Joel’s laptop that he used at Magee and had been very supportive during his educational journey. She had prayed for him every day and would have been very proud to see Joel graduate.”Following his graduation, Joel received assistance from his university mentor and has been successful in getting a job at Lloyds Bank in Belfast- a role he commences this week.Rhonda concluded: “We hope parents of children with special needs or autism can be encouraged by Joel’s journey. He’s worked hard and remained focused on what he wanted. We wish to thank the Southern Education Board, his teachers and classroom assistants and his mentor and lecturers at university.”Memorial to two IRA men killed in Loughgall razed to the groundMystery

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

That’s a welcome step forward.
