Smollett\u0027s bond was set last week by Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke (pictured). It is unclear who gave him permission to go to California Smollett, according to prosecutors, had previously bought drugs off from one of the brothers and knew them because they had appeared on Empire as extras. On January 29, the day of the attack, he called them an hour before it happened and an hour afterwards, according to prosecutors.He also spoke to them when they were in Nigeria for two weeks afterwards.  Smollett has not entered a plea yet.He is charged with one count of filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony which carries a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine. After being released on bond last Thursday, he went immediately to the Empire set to tell his colleagues he was innocent.  On Monday, Superintendent Eddie T.

Who could blame her for looking for a way out? The right playbook however is Churchill\u0027s. Keep buggering on,\u0027 writes David Davis. Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to address Parliament on TuesdayAs we enter the end game in negotiations with the EU, it would be folly of the highest magnitude to take No Deal off the table now because it takes away our leverage in negotiations and is against our national interest.Let\u0027s be honest. Many of those who want to take No Deal off the table are not seeking to ensure the UK obtains the optimum Brexit deal. Their real agenda is to block Brexit or secure one which is little more than a Brexit in name only.Various Commons amendments drawn up by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper in discussion with some Conservative Remainers, which would veto a No-Deal outcome, were wrecking amendments that would leave a poisonous constitutional legacy and break the solemn commitments made in the Conservatives\u0027 2017 election manifesto. Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s support only reinforces my view of this.It is time instead to focus on what actually unites our Government, our party and our country. Record numbers of Britons who voted for Brexit want it delivered on time. Above all we all want an orderly exit from the European Union.            The Haltemprice and Howden writes: \u0027Mrs May\u0027s announcement yesterday in which she conceded two Commons votes on Brexit in mid March is the wrong move. It sends the wrong message to the EU. Opening up the possibility of ruling out No Deal, or extending Article 50, may harm our negotiating position.\u0027 Mr Davis is pictured at the launch of a proposed UK-EU free trade agreement in London on February 6The public has always been ahead of and more relaxed on No Deal than politicians. They are right to be. An anonymous civil servant recently said there are \u0027hundreds of No-Deal plans across all government departments just waiting for the green light from ministers to be made public\u0027. I know this to be true. Most of it I initiated in my first days as Brexit Secretary. It will be a sad day indeed if British politicians show such contempt for the public, and I fear the electoral consequences for my own party.For MPs now to try to blackmail the Government into surrendering its negotiating position, rip up constitutional conventions and seize control of the executive in order to obstruct Brexit, is an abuse of the parliamentary process and an affront to democracy.If MPs use the enormous powers they enjoy to thwart the expressed will of the people, that is a constitutional travesty. Such a blatant dismissal of the wishes of the public is contempt for democracy and for millions of Britons.Conservatism is based on pragmatism and realism. Which is precisely why we should now hold our nerve and see these negotiations through. The passing of the Commons amendment by Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady last month with its legally binding changes to the Northern Ireland backstop showed the way forward for the Prime Minister. It showed that there is a majority in Parliament for an improved EU withdrawal agreement and orderly Brexit.What on earth will be the consequences for our party if we don\u0027t do this? Only this weekend the Conservatives\u0027 national convention voted overwhelmingly in favour of leaving No Deal on the table and no delay to Brexit. It said scuppering the UK\u0027s departure from the EU would \u0027damage democracy and our party for a generation\u0027.We must unify the party around the Brexit the British people clearly voted for and offer them the optimistic future they deserve. It is also in our national interest.The Prime Minister should ignore those ministers currently having a panic attack about the prospects of No Deal. Their fears are certainly exaggerated. More critically, while No Deal might – might – be economically difficult, No Brexit would be a democratic disaster.Ignore the saboteurs, the wreckers, and the blackmailers. Don\u0027t concede ground. Free our minds of doubt and danger. We can achieve it. Hold our nerve and deliver what we promised."},{"url":null,"title":"Decathalon stores scrap plans sell hijab France runners France","story":"    A model sports the Decathlon head covering, meant for runners and athletesThe controversy is the latest in France over face- and body-covering garments worn by Muslim women. The hijab covers the hair but leaves the face open.While opponents of the attire say it subjugates women, its defenders argue that items like the sports hijab allow Muslim women to take an active role in society.Iranian Instagram influencers begin wearing hijab and delete...Models in headscarves and Islamic robes take to the catwalk...Austria\u0027s burqa ban comes into force this weekend, but also...German judge tells Syrian woman she must remove her Islamic...Share this articleIn 2004, France, home to Europe\u0027s largest Muslim population, banished the hijab from the classroom and government offices.

Mr Thissen had to hike through bushes to avoid police patrols before he could enter the games hall. The Japanese government has put exclusion zones around the area to protect people from potential radiation    Untouched: The site looks as though it has been undisturbed since the nuclear disaster in 2011 apart from the odd looted vending or cash machine. Mr Thissen noted how eerie it was that a once vibrant arcade hall was now deserted. He said: \u0027It was strange to find a normally vibrant place totally silent and sombre, no lights, visuals or sound\u0027Apart from looted vending and cash machines, the spot still had stacks of tokens, winnable cuddly toys and games galore - all surfaces covered in a thin layer of radioactive dust.Mr Thissen believes the site appears to have remained untouched since the Fukushima nuclear disaster - which saw more than 160,000 people flee, leaving homes, belongings and their old lives behind.He said: \u0027The noise inside a SEGA hall is overwhelming, different loud sounds come from each arcade and they also contain a lot of visuals and flashing lights to attract people. Players are totally absorbed in the games.\u0027So it was strange to find a normally vibrant place totally silent and sombre, no lights, visuals or sound.\u0027While I was walking around, I suddenly heard stuffed animals say I love you.\u0027          Some of the winnable toys and games had batteries which were still in working order and Mr Thissen even heard stuffed animals saying \u0027I love you\u0027           Mr Thissen believes that without the radioactive dust covering the entire place, looters would have stolen the arcade games themselves and sold them on for more money. Pictured is a SEGA games hall that, by comparison, has not closed down          A thin layer of radioactive dust covers all of the old games and has served to deter any potential looters from disturbing the pristine site. Mr Thissen said: \u0027People fled during the Fukushima disaster and it appears to be in almost the exact same state as it was left\u0027\u0027It was crazy to see the batteries still worked. I also saw a lot of Disney figures which you could win.\u0027We barely touched anything, because there is radioactive dust.\u0027It\u0027s a unique location, because you normally don\u0027t get to see a SEGA or arcade hall which is fully intact.Japan \u0027highly likely\u0027 to be hit by huge earthquake that will...Tsunami fears in Japan after deep-sea fish associated with...Share this article\u0027I only noticed vending and cash machines were pried open by looters.\u0027Normally they would take out the prices and sell the arcades. But because of the nuclear disaster everything is left behind.\u0027People fled during the Fukushima disaster and it appears to be in almost the exact same state as it was left.          The earthquake triggered a subsequent tsunami which destabilised a nearby nuclear power plant that would change the future of Fukushima forever           Following the disaster the government put up exclusion zones to try and minimise radiation contamination as much as possible. Mr Thissen says that government clean up projects usually happen fairly quickly so this preserved arcade hall wont stay like this for much longer   \u0027Soon the whole area will be history. The clean-up and rehabilitation happens really quick and former red zones are coming back to life.\u0027That\u0027s why I think it\u0027s important to show the real aftermath of the disaster before all traces are gone.\u0027A magnitude nine earthquake - the strongest ever experienced in Japan - hit the region in March 2011, and a subsequent tsunami destabilised the nuclear power plant that would forever change Fukushima.The spot has remained near-lifeless and hidden from the outside world behind government exclusion zones - put in place for fear of radiation contamination.Some of the games included Sonic the Hedgehog, Donkey Kong, House of the Dead, and many more, including toys of Disney characters, talking bears and more.Mr Thissen who visited the site for his YouTube channel, Exploring the Unbeaten Path, wasn\u0027t surprised by the extremely-pristine condition of the games hall.          Some of the games included in the abandoned site are Sonic the Hedgehog, Donkey Kong and House of the Dead (pictured). Mr Thissen had tried to get into the abandoned arcade hall in 2017 but because there was a lot of renovations and radioactive clean-up he was unable to get in          Mr Thissen believes that part of the reason the site is so untouched is because people living in Japan respect the boundaries put in place by authority  Having visited multiple spots within Fukushima, he believes the people of Japan respect the boundaries put in place, which has helped to preserve it as a near eight-year-old time piece.Mr Thissen said said: \u0027I wasn\u0027t surprised, because almost everything is left untouched in the forbidden zone.\u0027Everywhere else in the world these buildings would be totally looted after a few weeks.\u0027The Japanese people really respect the rules and never trespass, even if doors are wide open.He initially spotted the locations during his trip in 2017, but was unable to reach it.Now having gone back to document the dying remains of Fukushima, he hopes others will respect and appreciate the hall too.Mr Thissen added: \u0027We drove by this location in 2017 on route six - at that time the only open road which goes through the red zone - and I really wanted to see it.\u0027But because there was a lot of activity in the red zone - demolition, renovation, radioactive clean-up - we didn\u0027t manage to get there.\u0027We went back to document more of the forbidden zone of Fukushima, like this SEGA hall.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"EU negotiator Barnier insists trying deal Brexit","story":"    Emmanuel Macron\u0027s intervention, at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured), comes amid mounting pressure for a long delay of up to two years          Michel Barnier insisted he was doing \u0027all I can\u0027 to get a Brexit deal today with just 30 days until Britain is due to leave the EU          But the EU negotiator insisted again he would not re-write the Irish border backstop -despite Theresa May saying it is the only way to get MPs to agree the deal            One minister told the Standard: “Any delay has to be agreed by all 27 EU countries which means we cannot stipulate how long it would be,“The EU does not want a short delay.

The leader of the European Research Group writes that the Northern Ireland backstop in its current form would last indefinitely and needs to be changed The Northern Ireland backstop has always been the biggest sticking point in the negotiations – and for a very good reason. I am as determined as anyone that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should remain as peaceful and problem-free as it is today.However, in its current form, the backstop – which would allow for an open border between the two countries, leaving Northern Ireland subject to certain rules of the EU\u0027s single market – would last indefinitely.Relief for May as she WINS latest Commons showdown despite...EU could insist on a Brexit delay of TWO YEARS if May\u0027s deal...Share this articleThe whole point of leaving the EU is to take back control, not to leave the EU with the potential for lasting effective power over trade and regulations in Northern Ireland, or any other part of the UK.If this issue can be resolved, then I would be content to support the Prime Minister\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement.Geoffrey Cox, the much-respected Attorney General, is in Brussels trying to persuade the EU to agree to a legally binding date to the backstop.          Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, is trying to secure concessions on the backstop It would be wrong to jump the gun, but if he can achieve this it would mark a fundamental change to the agreement and allow Brexiteers such as me to accept it. Once we can secure a limit to the backstop, all the other imperfections in Mrs May\u0027s deal, such as continued meddling by the European Court of Justice and our continuing to pay huge sums into EU coffers, become much less problematic.The key difference is that these are all time-limited, whereas the backstop, as currently outlined, is potentially everlasting.Once a final date is put on it, our objections to the deal, like the effects of its provisions, fade away.I really do not mind what form of words the Attorney General and the EU agree on regarding the backstop – as long as it expires before the next election and has the same legal status as the deal. And I do not agree with those who say the Withdrawal Agreement has to be reopened to solve the backstop problem. It is itself an appendix to the treaty, so I would be happy with a further appendix, as this would have equal legal force.In my view, that would satisfy most of us who are worried, and it may also help those who say the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be reopened to save face. I take a practical and not a theological attitude towards these matters.Those who have suggested that I and my Conservative colleagues in the European Research Group have gone out of our way to make things difficult for the Prime Minister could not be more wrong. Our aim has consistently been to follow the commitments made in the 2017 Tory election manifesto and implicit in the 2016 referendum result.          Prime Minister Theresa May (pictured leaving Parliament this afternoon) is still determined to keep to the March 29 departure dateThat some Cabinet ministers have undermined collective responsibility and tried to thwart Mrs May is hardly our fault.The Prime Minister says it is still her fervent hope that the UK leaves the EU on March 29. I share her sentiments.If – and I stress if – she can secure the necessary assurances on the backstop I have outlined, I would be delighted to support her deal and help avoid any delay to Brexit.It is not my job to tell other Conservative MPs what to do, but I am sure many other passionate advocates of Brexit would take the same pragmatic and patriotic view.At long last, we would have delivered our promise to the 17.4 million who voted to leave the EU in June 2016.And, as soon as that happens, we Conservatives can put our differences behind us, reunite and focus on winning the next election – and keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of Number 10. "},{"url":null,"title":"Stacey Dooley criticised Labour MP David Lammy","story":"Labour MP David Lammy criticised Stacey Dooley for appearing in a Comic Relief documentary in Uganda which promotes \u0027tired and unhelpful stereotypes\u0027 and for encouraging a \u0027white saviour\u0027 complex           Dooley, 31, is currently filming with Comic Relief about neonatal clinics and malaria in Uganda          Mr Lammy did acknowledge Miss Dooley\u0027s \u0027good motives\u0027 but bemoaned the British celebrity trope of travelling to poorer parts of Africa to film Comic Relief packagesWriting on social media, Mr Lammy said: \u0027The world doesn\u0027t need anymore white saviours.

It’ll even find the best route to schoolForm-filling, missed voicemails, endless phone calls – recruiting temporary teachers at very short notice can be a cumbersome process for both candidates and the school. Admin like this takes up valuable time that could be much better spent doing what matters most: being in the classroom. At a time when both schools and teachers are under increasing pressure to get it right first time, temporary recruitment is an area that’s ripe for reinvention – and tech such as the Affinity Hub app is leading the way.“At 7am, our recruitment offices would be flooded with calls from schools, all trying to get staff for that day because teachers had called in sick or were unavailable,” says Marie Kirwin, project manager for the Affinity Hub. “Teachers would come out of school and find a barrage of voicemail messages offering them jobs for tomorrow. We wanted to create a system that would give our candidates and our clients control of their own recruitment.”With all the necessary admin online, candidates save time using the Affinity Hub well before they step into a school. Before their agency interview, they can upload their vital documentation via the hub, meaning no piles of paper getting lost in the post. If something is missing, out of date or incorrect, the agency can let the candidate know before they come in, so they don’t have to make another trip.Once they’re registered, candidates can change their availability status and accept or reject roles with a touch of the screen. Previously, they would have to ring their consultant every week with their availability – which could change very quickly. There are no fiddly timesheets to fill in and get signed: they simply touch in their phones when they arrive at the school to record the exact times of their arrival and departure. All these timesheets and pay slips can be viewed at any time, and the candidate is automatically joined to the company’s employee loyalty scheme, allowing them to accrue points to get benefits.When the next role comes up, there’s no need for candidates to ring or text with their availability – they simply select the opportunities that best suit them. And the app will even find the best route to the candidate’s school automatically, using Google Maps.Better tech suits schools as well: they can manage their entire process themselves in a very short time. Creating a job on the app takes just a few moments before it’s pushed out to candidates. A talent pool facility allows them to send that opportunity out to a selected group of candidates who have done well working at the school previously.The entire process can be done via the hub. “It’s much quicker and sleeker – and it means only one set of login details, too, which is a big bonus in this day and age,” says Esme Bianchi-Barry, MD of Monarch Education, an education recruitment business brand within Affinity Workforce, which has been trialling the hub with its candidates.The app also suits the schools of today. Many multi-academy trusts manage their recruitment over several schools via a single office. The hub allows them to see exactly where the needs are across these schools in real-time, meaning that any gaps can be filled quickly and easily. Having all this information on a single system also gives them the data to plan ahead. “They can draw out certain trends,” explains Bianchi-Barry. “For instance, is their cover booked first thing in the morning? Or is it mainly pre-booked? What kind of teachers do they need most commonly? Analysing these trends means that they can improve their forward planning, and budget more efficiently. It’s hard to gather this data when you’ve got five or six different schools using five or six systems across 15 suppliers.”Having the day-to-day recruitment taken care of also means that schools and recruitment consultants have time to focus on the bigger picture together. “Consultants are able to focus on the more complicated roles, or the newer schools that might not have people in, or new roles,” says Kirwin.Of course, no app or piece of tech can be a substitute for person-to-person interaction. “We are very clear that we don’t want to take away the human element of the candidate and consultant relationship,” says Bianchi-Barry. “So much good stuff comes from that. It helps us place the right candidates, and do right by both candidate and client. But the app makes the admin so much easier.”Making the recruitment process better is a win for everyone, says Kirwin. “For schools, it’s a vital time-saver. And it could even help attract more teachers into this area at a time when teacher recruitment numbers are down. We can show newly qualified teachers, for example, how the hub makes it is easier to work in this kind of environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9dda8ec79a5f058b632911ec3518f203e1b7011/0_0_4344_2606/master/4344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1129ed29948fa9c5603635cdc70da227","title":"vatican opens investigation that could lead to george pell being defrocked","story":"The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith will examine Pell’s case in the light of his conviction for child sexual assaultThe Vatican is opening its own investigation into accusations against Cardinal George Pell, after his conviction for child sexual assault in Australia, a spokesman said on Wednesday.The move means that Pell, who maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the verdict, could be dismissed from the priesthood if the Vatican‘s doctrinal department also finds him guilty.The Pell conviction has been particularly embarrassing for the Vatican and Pope Francis, with it being made public just two days after the end of a major meeting of church leaders on how to better tackle the abuse of children by clergy.Pell, 77, formerly the third most powerful man in the Vatican, spent his first night behind bars on Wednesday after he was remanded in custody pending sentencing for sexually abusing two choir boys in Melbourne in 1996 and 1997.“After the guilty verdict in the first instance concerning Cardinal Pell, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) will now handle the case following the procedure and within the time established by canonical norm,” Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said.He did not elaborate about the timing or the procedure. The investigation could lead to a full trial or an abbreviated “administrative process”, a Vatican source said.Pell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.Pell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u0026nbspPell\u0026nbsplives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.Pell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.Pell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u0026nbspPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u0026nbspThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.Pell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican’s treasurer.\u0026nbspPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u0026nbspPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church’s responsibility for child abuse to that of a “trucking company” whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale\u0027s offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u0026nbspa “sad story” but “not of much interest” to him.Australian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as “absolute and disgraceful rubbish”.\u0026nbspPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.Pell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick’s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.Prosecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.The jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u0026nbspProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted. Gisotti also confirmed that Pell was no longer head of the Secretariat for the Economy, where he oversaw the Vatican‘s finances. Pell’s five-year term in the post expired several days ago and the pope has not yet named a successor.Pell, the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted for child sex offences, was found guilty in December of five charges related to the abuse of the 13-year-old boys while he was archbishop of Melbourne in the 1990s.Pell’s guilty verdict was revealed in Australia on Tuesday after a court suppression order was dropped. He will be sentenced on 13 March.Last month, a CDF “administrative process” found Theodore McCarrick, a former cardinal who served as archbishop of Washington, DC, guilty of sexual abuse of minors and adults.McCarrick, who resigned as cardinal last year when the accusations first surfaced and were deemed credible by US Church investigators, was dismissed from the priesthood.McCarrick became the first cardinal to step down in a century and the highest-profile Catholic figure to be defrocked over sexual abuse.While McCarrick’s case began and ended in church tribunals, the Vatican investigation of Pell unusually follows a conviction in the courts.The Vatican procedure could choose to use information from the Australian court, Vatican sources said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a8aefd54f7fd85e11ddabde63cd7ee11f1d5320/0_70_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9ac855d296ecb24e02652568bef4ad","title":"the uninhabitable earth review david wallace wells","story":"Enough to induce a panic attack ... a brutal portrait of climate change and our future lives on Earth.

David Wallace-Wells, author of the distressingly titled The Uninhabitable Earth, is here to tell you that you do not. “It is,” as he puts it in the book’s first line, “worse, much worse, than you think.”The book expands on a viral article, also titled The Uninhabitable Earth, which Wallace-Wells published in New York in the summer of 2017, and which frightened the life out of everyone who read it. Writing at length, he is even more remorseless in his delineation of what the not nearly distant enough future probably holds for us. The book’s longest section, entitled Elements of Chaos, is composed of 12 short and brutal chapters, each of which foretells a specific dimension of our forecast doom, and whose titles alone – Heat Death Dying Oceans Unbreathable Air Plagues of Warming – are enough to induce an honest-to-God panic attack.Wallace-Wells identifies a tendency, even among those of us who think we are already sufficiently terrified of the future, to be strangely complacent about the figures. Yes, we know that climate change will cause sea level rises of between four to eight feet before the end of this century, but then again what’s a few feet if you happen to live a couple of miles inland? “That so many feel already acclimated to the prospect of a near-future world with dramatically higher oceans,” he writes, “should be as dispiriting and disconcerting as if we’d already come to accept the inevitability of extended nuclear war – because that is the scale of devastation the rising oceans will bring.”This all makes for relentlessly grim reading, particularly in that first section. As is generally the case in any sustained exposure to the subject of climate change – a subject that can seem increasingly like the only subject – a kind of apocalyptic glaze descends over even the most conscientious eyes, a peculiarly contemporary compound of boredom and horror. (“Human kind,” as the bird in TS Eliot’s Four Quartets sagely points out, “cannot bear very much reality.”) It’s a problem of which Wallace-Wells is clearly aware. “If you have made it this far, you are a brave reader,” as he puts it, somewhere past the halfway point, acknowledging the likelihood of the material he’s sifting through causing despondency in anyone considering it. “But you are not merely considering it,” he clarifies, “you are about to embark on living it. In many cases, in many places, we already are.”That last point turns out to be one of the most crucial of the book’s warnings. Because as dire as the projections are, if you are surveying the topic from a privileged western vantage, it’s easy to overlook how bad things have already got, to accept the hurricanes and the heatstroke deaths as simply the unfortunate nature of things. In this way, Wallace-Wells raises the disquieting spectre of future normalisation – the prospect that we might raise, incrementally but inexorably, our baseline of acceptable human suffering. (This phenomenon is not without precedent. See, for example, the whole of human history.)For a relatively short book, The Uninhabitable Earth covers a great deal of cursed ground – drought, floods, wildfires, economic crises, political instability, the collapse of the myth of progress – and reading it can feel like taking a hop-on hop-off tour of the future’s sprawling hellscape. It’s not without its hopeful notes: in a sense, none of this would even be worth talking about if there were nothing we could do about it. As Wallace-Wells points out, we already have all the tools we need to avoid the worst of what is to come: “a carbon tax and the political apparatus to aggressively phase out dirty energy a new approach to agricultural practices and a shift away from beef and dairy in the global diet and public investment in green energy and carbon capture”. The fact that the route out of this hell is straightforward does not mean, of course, that it won’t be incredibly arduous, or that we should be confident of making it.The book, however, is less focused on solutions than on clarifying the scale of the problem, the horror of its effects. You could call it alarmist, and you would not be wrong. (In the closing pages, Wallace-Wells himself accepts the charge as “fair enough, because I am alarmed”.) But to read The Uninhabitable Earth – or to consider in any serious way the scale of the crisis we face – is to understand the collapse of the distinction between alarmism and plain realism. To fail to be alarmed is to fail to think about the problem, and to fail to think about the problem is to relinquish all hope of its solution.• Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine is published by Granta.

You troggy little twit! Don’t you dare talk pigsquiffle to me, you prunty old pogswizzler!”Either that, or she would thank the child profusely for taking the time to read her latest book, Roald Dahl’s Rotsome and Repulsant Words. Ostensibly a children’s dictionary of Dahl’s insults and expletives, the book also offers a chance to explore and analyse Dahl’s creative use of language, encouraging Dahl lovers of any age to have fun playing with his naughty-sounding words.“Children and grownups alike are fascinated by words that push the boundaries a little bit – and Dahl, in his language as much as in his characters and his plots, always has a twinkle in his eye,” says Rennie. “Children are not going to get into trouble by using these words. But at the same time, they’re fun to say and they’re very powerful. I think we, as grownups, sometimes forget how much fun language can be, especially when you make words up.”Dahl created more than 300 words, she says, and sets a liberating example to anyone whose creativity with words was – or is – stifled at school: “We know from looking at children’s writing how naturally creative children are with words, how much they love chopping words up and combining them to make new words. Dahl does that, and this book encourages children to carry on doing that, to keep going with what they enjoy doing naturally with language and to be creative.”Like Lewis Carroll before him, the techniques Dahl used to invent words are built firmly on the existing traditions of the English language. For example, to make his rude “gobblefunk” easily understood by children, Dahl relies on reduplication (“ucky-mucky”), malapropisms (“tummyrot” for “tommyrot”), onomatopoeia (“whizzpopper” meaning, famously, a sound “even the Queen’s bottom makes”), portmanteau words (gruesome and rotten combine to create “rotsome”) and, most powerfully, alliterative phonaesthesia, where consonant clusters and specific sounds connote meaning to the made-up words.“Squinky squiddler” (which the giants in The BFG call something small, squashy and insignificant), “troggy little twit” (how the giants refer to someone who is vile and horrible, evoking a troll in a bog) and “snozzcumber” (a “sickable”, “disgusterous” cucumber-like vegetable) are just a few examples of this in Dahl’s writing.This is why children understand the meanings, Rennie says. “That’s why they are so much fun: they are not complete nonsense. On the surface, he seems to be breaking the rules. But dig a little deeper and you realise he’s following standard patterns that people understand intuitively.”Rennie notes that, just as Dahl learned to make sense of some of the nonsensical words and phrases spoken by his wife, Patricia Neal, after she had a stroke, Sophie in The BFG is quickly able to translate for the BFG.As a bilingual Norwegian and English speaker, Dahl would have been able to look at the construction of English more objectively than monolingual writers, says Michael Rosen, children’s writer and author of The Fantastic Mr Dahl. “If you are bilingual, it gives you two heads. You have a head you can use to look at the other head. It enables you to see that you’ve got completely different ways of talking about something similar, and that one language might be able to do stuff or describe stuff the other language can’t.”He also credits Dahl’s education at a public school, Renton, for enabling Dahl to realise he could invent his own subversive vernacular: “Children in boarding schools often set up little coteries, partly to defend themselves against the authoritarianism of those schools with their own private language. Often, it’s elitist, but with Dahl the nice thing is that he wanted to share his language with children.”Frequently, Dahl invents insults and expletives to give power to the powerless characters in his stories, he says. “When you write stuff, and a teacher corrects it and hands it back to you, you don’t necessarily know that language belongs to you, that you can own it. But if you play with words and language or you know that you are entitled to, that is one way to own literacy – and that’s what Dahl wanted. He was desperate for children to read and have fun when they were reading.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d844be79adb7fc4fa5bbe9ac553a40a6466ae61/0_253_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc9efd2c5205cbdc8282c3b622edc24","title":"kashmir peace india pakistan","story":"In the summer of 1999, I was standing outside our ancestral home in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, when I saw fighter jets roar past in the skies above me. The Indian air force was carrying out sorties towards the mountainous district of Kargil to dislodge Pakistani militants and, as we found out later, Pakistani soldiers. The troops had quietly occupied the snow-capped peaks as part of a stealth operation masterminded by the then Pakistani general and future president Pervez Musharraf.The sight and sound of sophisticated military hardware provided a brief thrill, but it soon turned into panic. What if these bombers dropped their lethal cache on our home? At night, as I lay in bed, I imagined our neighbourhood as rubble from which acrid smoke rose. I imagined dear ones lying dead in homes and on streets, like in war films. I saw friends and myself as bodies in pools of blood. It was terrifying.I was reminded of those febrile, frightening times, during the Kargil war, which lasted two months, as news came of the latest episode in the 71-year-old military conflict over this disputed region in the foothills of the Himalayas.Indian fighter jets this week crossed into Pakistani territory to target – according to Indian officials – a militant camp run by Jaish-e-Mohammed. JeM, a Pakistan-based Islamist group, had claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed 44 Indian paramilitaries in Kashmir on 14 February. Indian officials said the airstrike killed “a very large number of militants” in the camp, in the forests of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. They said the incident had been a “pre-emptive strike”, as India had intelligence that the group was planning more attacks. Pakistan rejected the claim, insisting that India’s incursion had not caused any damage, and the Pakistani government stated it would respond to the strikes “at the time and place of its choosing”.In a major tit-for-tat escalation of the conflict, that response came on Tuesday, when Pakistan said its air force had shot down two Indian fighter jets. A spokesperson said that one of the planes had fallen in Pakistani territory and two pilots had been captured. India’s foreign ministry confirmed the loss of a fighter plane and said a pilot was missing. A video purportedly showing the captured pilot appeared on the internet. This came soon after Pakistan said it had carried out airstrikes across the line of control – one of the most heavily militarised borders in the world – that ides part of Kashmir. (China controls another part in the east.)Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, has suggested the strikes were political, carried out for “domestic consumption” by his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, ahead of national elections in May. There may well be some truth in this statement. Kashmir has been used as a pawn in the political power struggle in the region between India and Pakistan ever since partition. Amid claims and counterclaims, the two countries have gone back to their old duel, exchanging artillery shells across the de facto border. There are already reports of injuries to civilians in border villages. I called my family in Srinagar to check if they were all right. Like most Kashmiris, they are used to living under long sieges, but they are worried now as food supplies, gas and petrol are short. In panic, people have stocked up on medicines and babyfood. They pray the war ends before it starts.The long-running war began soon after the decolonisation of south Asia, in 1947. Under the partition plan agreed between the countries and Britain, their erstwhile colonial ruler, Kashmir was to be free to join either India or Pakistan, its statehood settled via a UN-mandated plebiscite. But as Maharaja Hari Singh, then king of independent Kashmir, dithered, tribesmen from Pakistan’s North-West Frontier province moved in. The king, who had wanted Kashmir to stay independent, asked India for help, resulting in a year-long war.Fighting again flared in 1965, coming to an end after Soviet mediation. The Kargil war, which resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, was brought to an end when the then US president, Bill Clinton, intervened. This month’s dramatic escalation follows a long season of bloodletting. Since January 2018, nearly 600 people, including civilians, militants and soldiers, have been killed. Hundreds of Kashmiri civilians have also been wounded, scores of them blinded by pellet guns Indian forces have used to quell civilian protests. Kashmir has become a vast cauldron of sadness, fear and anger.Now, amid comic-book celebrations of war on both sides, there exists a real danger that the decades of low-intensity war may turn uglier. The two countries’ leaders are being exhorted, in TV studios and on social media, to take tough action. In their unsightly quest for prime-time ratings, these armchair warriors do not seem to care that the clamour for more war means copious bloodshed in faraway borderlands. It will be Kashmiris who will bear the brunt of such a destructive turn of events.Given this backdrop, India and Pakistan must surely now realise that resolving Kashmir is an infinitely better course of action than war. The nuclear-armed rivals have been here before, many times, and the fact that they’re now in yet another conflict can mean only one thing: that their past actions haven’t worked for either country – and most definitely not for Kashmir. It is time for the two states to give up their intransigent positions.An old uncle of mine once told me: you can always go back to war if peace doesn’t work.It’s time to make efforts to avert a full-fledged conflagration that will create widespread carnage.• Mirza Waheed is theauthor of the novels The Collaborator, The Book of Gold Leaves and Tell Her Everything"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f15f1c76809066aee23e4a693b84253db8de07f8/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be8e4b7e90f2c1134ed028546392d972","title":"remainers brexit eu second referendum britain","story":"Ever since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, two things have been clear. No serious attempt to reverse or even moderate the leave decision would ever be uncontroversial. And any such attempt would require a degree of present legitimacy that could be acquired only in the light of new events and with the passing of time. The question today is whether we have now reached such a moment.Very clearly, there was no such moment in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 referendum. It would have been too soon. It would have been merely a spasm of outrage. The voters had only just expressed their will. No government could defy that decision, even if it had wanted to. Theresa May rightly grasped that she had become prime minister with a mandate to deliver on the vote.Yet that could never be the end of the matter. Three structural things have ensured that even a stronger and more talented government than this one would struggle to do what May wanted. The first was the difficulty of accommodating any one-off referendum decision within a political system based on parliamentary sovereignty. The second was the general election in 2017, which deprived the government of a majority. And the third was the depth and breadth of the 40-plus years of intertwining of the UK and the EU, which would require years of detailed surgery to separate.Two and a half years on, things are, unsurprisingly, rather different. The public mood has shifted significantly, though not decisively, against Brexit. Much of that shift is down to the way May has handled the issue – her narrow-minded red lines, her reluctance to reach out – as well as the inevitable wear and tear that begins to affect any prime ministership. A bit of it is also down to extraneous events such as the impact of Donald Trump, the growth of mob politics more generally and the grinding resilience of low economic growth across Europe. Most of it, though, is simply a function of a Brexit timetable that dictates irreversible outcomes after 29 March – and therefore concentrates minds.Some voters will still be outraged, nearly three years on from the referendum, by the slightest suggestion that any aspect of the government’s approach can be questioned, never mind that the entire Brexit decision might be up for reconsideration in a second referendum. That hostility remains a massive factor that cannot be ignored by those who want a softer Brexit than the government seeks, or who want no Brexit at all. Nor is it ignored. It is the ever-present descant to any and every Brexit conversation or judgment.But the world, and politics, never stand still. It isn’t just treachery, as the cynical French diplomat Talleyrand once put it, it is chiefly a matter of dates. The same thing goes for political imperatives of every kind. There is a time and a place for everything. It was always likely that February and March 2019 would be the time when those who want to mitigate or reverse Brexit would have their best chance of success. It was always probable that these final weeks of the article 50 process were going to provide Brexit’s high-noon moment. And that is precisely where we find ourselves now.It is natural to be frustrated by the frequent deferrals in this denouement. But you fight a battle only when you have the best chance of winning. That’s true on all sides, whether pro- or anti-Brexit. Sooner or later there must be a battle, or battles. They cannot be infinitely postponed. Brexit must either take place on 29 March or not. If it does take place, Brexit’s terms must be settled in some form or another, or none.So the fact that this week looked likely at one stage to be a crucial moment but turned out instead to be a bit of an anticlimax should not distract from the main issue. This week, fearing that more Conservatives could join the independents, May managed to buy a bit more time from the Tory party by her important admission that the 29 March deadline may be missed and that the article 50 process may have to be extended if the government loses its plan B vote on 12 March. Buying time is what May does.Yet the extension of article 50 is potentially a watershed concession. May’s pretence is that this is just a small matter, a little bit of added time because of unexpected holdups. She talked again on Wednesday of such an extension being short and limited. That is simply an unrealistic position. It assumes that the extension would merely be for the purpose of ensuring that MPs finally give their approval to a revision of her original plan and for putting this on the necessary legislative foundation.Once again, it shows May pretending – as she always does – that nothing would really have changed. Yet in reality everything may have changed. May’s entire Brexit strategy is now being kept alive by two things. The first is her consistent leaning to the right in order to keep Conservative MPs onside behind her Brexit plan. The second is her hope that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, can agree some form of legal wording with the EU to enable him to change his advice that the Northern Irish backstop could be a permanent sanction. If he does change his advice, pro-Brexit Tories and the DUP may be persuaded to back the deal.But both parts of this are smoke and mirrors. More than 100 MPs in May’s party oppose her Brexit strategy. And if Cox gets the form of words that May craves, it will be the only change from the plan A on which May was trounced in January. That doesn’t automatically mean that the Tories who voted against plan A will not vote for plan B either. But it surely means that if May loses on 12 March, and especially if she loses badly, she will have no plan C to put in its place. Extending article 50, in other words, would mean having to embrace a new approach to Brexit.There are several options here. A second referendum, offering a choice between a deal (possibly May’s) or remaining in the EU might be one, especially now that Labour has shifted its position this week. A more likely approach would involve the European free trade area-style arrangement that cabinet ministers such as Amber Rudd and David Gauke would prefer, though it would involve May trashing her red lines. Or May could try to engineer a general election in the belief that Jeremy Corbyn’s stock is now too low for him to pull off another surprise like 2017’s.All of these options are possibilities. Most of them would require more than the short extension May mentions – it would be months, not weeks. None of them can be dismissed as complete fantasy. Yet every one is a radical shift from the assumption of 2016 that May’s way was the only way. Partly that’s May’s fault. But the Britain of 2019 is no longer the Britain of 2016. Labour’s shift on a second referendum is part of that. So is the very public revolt by Rudd and her colleagues. The passage of time means the limits of the possible have changed so radically that no Brexit, though not a certainty, is now a real possibility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a79c94ce1bcd6607d34dd8a61c53e93a81ee200/221_262_4832_2900/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f353d2633f302ef8351911a61cb0d398","title":"the guardian view on eu citizens mays moral blindspot","story":"Many people were shocked by the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, but few felt stronger emotions than the three million citizens of other EU countries living in the UK, whose futures became alarmingly uncertain. That anxiety has hardly diminished since then. On Wednesday MPs offered some reassurance to those contemplating a future in legal limbo. Parliament endorsed an amendment instructing the government to salvage the citizens’ rights portion of Theresa May’s EU withdrawal agreement, even if that deal itself falls.It is revealing that the prime minister did not immediately see virtue in supporting the amendment, which was tabled by Alberto Costa, a Conservative. On Tuesday, Mrs May told the Commons that Mr Costa’s suggestion was unworkable. But a day later, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, told a select committee that the idea of ring-fencing expatriate rights was sensible. Meanwhile, Mr Costa was forced to surrender his post as a ministerial aide (following a convention that freelancing frontbenchers do not amend government business). Hours later, David Lidington, the cabinet office minister, confirmed from the despatch box that the government supported the substance of the amendment so it passed uncontested.Such ineptitude would be farcical if it were not also frightening. It reflects chaos at the centre of government and disregard inside No 10 for the fate of millions of people whose lives have been turned upside down by choices the prime minister has made. Mrs May’s handling of the citizens’ rights question has been callous from the start. She has missed countless opportunities to signal magnanimity and cultivate goodwill. She has looked at every turn grudging in her pledges of continuity. She has shown no understanding of the damage that was done to Britain’s international reputation by her readiness to use insecure people as bargaining chips.That insensitivity is integral to the prime minister’s politics. It is the trait that expressed itself during a decade in the Home Office, cultivating the “hostile environment” that was meant to apply to migrants without legal entitlement to stay in the UK but that evolved into the Windrush scandal. The evidence of Mrs May’s career lends credence to the assertion by Anna Soubry, one of the MPs who quit the Tory party last week, that the prime minister has “a problem with immigrants”. That problem is hardwired into the UK’s Brexit strategy as a determination to end free movement, regardless of the consequences for the economy or for iniduals.Mrs May might believe that her anti-immigration politics are in tune with public opinion, but she pursues her agenda with a rigidity that appals leave voters as well as remainers. Mr Costa’s amendment was supported early on by MPs from every faction in the Brexit debate. Mrs May was a very late convert.It is right that MPs address the anxiety experienced by EU citizens who felt displaced by the referendum, but today’s symbolic declaration does not reach the root of their peril – removal of the legal basis on which people made Britain their home. Brexit is by definition a curtailment of rights bestowed by EU membership. Mrs May might not value the freedom of EU nationals to choose a life in Britain, nor has she shown much interest in the plight of British citizens who have exercised the reciprocal right in other European countries. She sees the end of free movement entirely as a benefit. Her inability to perceive that it can also be a cost, that it inflicts pain on millions of people, is not just politically obtuse, it is morally suspect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da33d20373125c50cfd476ee4a4308f4390df9e/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bf03cc55021c7461d929a753b03e0de","title":"can data sharing improve our wellbeing","story":"As the use of artificial intelligence becomes increasingly widespread across the health industry, could machine-powered software help reduce illnesses?Healthcare is on the brink of a technological revolution that will transform the way we think about medicine and how we care for ourselves.Voice and digital assistants could one day detect suicidal tendencies in the speech patterns of users and refer them to therapy. Hospitals will use algorithms to analyse data about populations to understand when to expect a flu outbreak. Doctors will turn to artificial intelligence (AI) systems to help them prescribe the right drugs.These innovations will be enabled by harnessing the abundance of data flowing from medical equipment, electronic health records, wearable devices, analysis of our DNA and even our digital communications.For Femi Ladega, vice-president and chief technology officer at DXC Technology’s healthcare ision, the advent of AI will offer new avenues for turning data into a medical tool that will be just as important as stethoscopes, scalpels and x-rays. “We are in a new wave of healthcare where the use of AI and machine learning will start to turn the deluge of data we have got into contextual specific insights that enables truly personalised care. That is where the industry is heading,” he says.These new insights and knowledge from data will become vital – doctors won’t just access data about a patient. AI-powered software will also tell them about the implications of that data – to make them actionable. If they are about to prescribe drugs to a patient, the system would automatically recommend the best medicine for the patient, taking into account many more characteristics and factors than it would be possible for the doctor to consider. This would then be presented to the doctor to prescribe.But for this new reality to come about, physicians and healthcare providers must first find effective technology that allows them to gather, share and analyse data.As a step on the path to this digitally enabled health system, DXC has launched a new data platform that allows health providers to connect information from a range of sources such as care records and medical history. DXC Open Health Connect brings together data from hospitals, doctors’ surgeries and electronic medical records, and offers doctors context about the implications of that data. The system can help doctors identify at-risk patients and suggest preemptive measures to prevent them from getting ill, reducing the chance of them being admitted to hospital.“We are trying to use the profile of an inidual to give them a wellness programme,” says Ladega. In future, for instance, sophisticated software systems will analyse patient profiles to identify those who are at risk of developing diabetes, then target preventive programmes at them. If the outside temperature drops below a certain level, software could analyse a hospital’s local population to determine the number of people who are susceptible to lung disease or asthma at lower temperatures. That insight could be used to estimate hospital demand and predict that in the following hour or two, there is likely to be a rise in visits to A\u0026ampE. The hospital could then put in place plans to cope with the rise in numbers.Another way AI could improve healthcare is by using digital assistants to detect depression among users from the words they use when interacting with the assistants and from their tone of voice. Men are often reluctant to talk about their mental wellbeing, but they may be willing to open up to a robotic voice assistant. “The system converts the voice to text and picks out sensitive words that could highlight the risk of depression. Once you pass a threshold, the system will automatically book you an appointment or create a channel for you to talk to somebody,” explains Ladega.DXC uses a model of data sharing called FHIR, pronounced “fire”, which stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. This is a standard for sharing health information across IT systems. So, if someone is involved in a road traffic accident, the hospital could access their medical history and other relevant information from all their previous healthcare interactions. FHIR allows health providers to build APIs, pieces of software that allow different computer systems to share information.“That model forces the democratisation of information in a standard way,” says Ladega. “In this day and age of big data, you have to work on open data, and this has got to be based on open architecture. That way, you remove any constraints to information sharing,” he adds.He predicts that the 21st century will see the rise of a “genomic generation”, who use personal genomic services to analyse their own DNA data to understand their genomic makeup. This will influence their lifestyle choices, for instance avoiding sunbathing if they are genetically prone to skin cancer. Citizens will take greater responsibility for their own healthcare using data from wearables and fitness trackers.“The genomic generation is going to bring a different dimension to the patient-provider relationship, and we will feel better for it. The trend I see is that health and wellness is going to be redefined in the next five to seven years,” says Ladega.The new era of shared data will bring about improvements in health similar in significance to historic advances in medicine such as vaccines and penicillin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b87a4a7c08acf50111722f4959a765faf3c0c0/0_130_5100_3062/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6a261fee371654733811354d7a88037","title":"what is your experience of zero tolerance behaviour policies in schools","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, parents and young people about their schools’ discipline policiesThis year has seen increasing criticism of behaviour policies and punishments used by schools – from putting children in isolation booths as punishment for breaking school rules, to excluding them for apparently minor indiscretions.This month the TES and Schools Week reported that a multi-academy trust had been using a strategy called “flattening the grass”, in which students were publicly humiliated in assemblies and made to cry in order to establish the MAT’s expectations of students’ behaviour when it takes over a new school.Whether you’re a teacher, parent or young person over the age of 16, we’d like to hear from you.What experience do you have of school behaviour policies?

That is the task the designer Bruno Sialelli is faced with at the French fashion house Lanvin and on Wednesday morning all eyes were on his debut.It’s not an easy task for a young designer who is used to being behind the scenes to take the spotlight, not least at a house which has been in turmoil since the acrimonious departure of its much-loved and revered creative director Alber Elbaz in 2015. Amid staff revolts and sporadic changes in strategy from the then owner, Shaw-Lan Wang, in the three-and-a-half years that have passed the house has seen two designers – Bouchra Jarrar and Olivier Lapidus – hurriedly appointed before being swiftly shown the door.As a result, the industry is pinning its hopes on Sialelli not only delivering a collection of hits but reigniting the reciprocal love affair they enjoyed. If he was nervous about his big moment he didn’t show it. While admitting it was an emotional moment, he said after the show that he was focused on “redefining the wardrobe” of the house and to do so he visited the personal archive of the house’s founder, Jeanne Lanvin.This was not, however, a trip down memory lane, but a fresh reinvention of the house’s history, which informed but did not dictate.Sialelli said he was instinctively drawn to the brand’s famous Lanvin blue, which he presented in modern knitwear that took the form of a cardigan-dress hybrid, pea coats with scalloped lapels and blue ribbed tabards.The latter was part of the overriding medieval theme of the show. Sialelli revealed Lanvin herself frequently worked with motifs from the era and he reintroduced it in scarf prints and – poignantly – an appliquéd motif of a knight in shining armour, a clever nod to Sialelli’s own crusade.He also worked Aztec and Fairisle patterned blankets into inserts on coats as wind-flaps and cuffs. Lanvin was a prolific traveller, he explained, “always bringing back the most beautiful fabrics” from her trips around the world.Refreshingly, Sialelli injected a sense of fun and mischief to the house that Elbaz delivered in bucketloads but which has been absent during his successors’ tenures. Illustrations from Jean de Brunhoff’s Babar the Elephant books appeared on silk shirts and bomber jackets, while a fox motif was 3D-appliquéd on lace slips, and hemlines came with click-clacky Perspex embellishment.Sialelli worked for four years under JW Anderson at Loewe – aka the poster brand for blending art, culture, and fashion – before his appointment at Lanvin, and it is clear he wants to bring that spirit with him.Before that he was in the design team at Balenciaga where he navigated the transition between the head designers Alexander Wang and Nicolas Ghesquière in 2015, suggesting that he has understanding of the upheaval the long-time atelier team at Lanvin have been through.In February 2018, the private Chinese conglomerate Fosun International, controlled by the billionaire businessman Guo Guangchang, fought off the competition to become majority shareholders in the business, leaving Wang with a minority stake. While details of the deal were undisclosed, the group is said to have injected a minimum of €100m (£85m) into the brand to help mop up inherited issues and kick-start the house into a new trajectory.On Wednesday, the show notes said Sialelli was “sublimating the illustrious heritage of the French maison in the midst of its own renaissance” and judging from this first collection, Lanvin looks like it’s finally found the man for the job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Here’s your step-by-step guide to a faultless dessertSticky toffee pudding: the very name is enough to gladden the heart, if not the waistband. This ‘British classic’, famous around the world thanks to a namecheck in Harry Potter, is actually a relatively recent invention, probably with Canadian origins, popularised by a Lake District hotel in the 1970s.

Stone and roughly chop the dates – though sticky, this process should be relatively easy with a small, sharp knife.Medjool dates are softer and richer in flavour than some other common varieties, so are the best ones to use for this recipe, if you can find them. Put all the ingredients for the sauce in a small pan. Put over a low heat until the butter melts, stirring regularly to encourage it, then mix together, turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Simmer for about four minutes, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.Grease a 24cm x 24cm baking dish with butter. Pour half the sauce into the prepared dish, tip it this way and that until the base is completely coated, then put the dish in the freezer while you make the batter. Leave the rest of the sauce in the pan for now. Boil a kettle of water.Put the dates and bicarb in a heatproof bowl and pour over 300ml boiling water to cover. Leave them to soften while you get the rest of the batter ingredients ready.If you’re using the walnuts (pecans would also be nice), heat a small, dry frying pan over a medium-high heat, toast them until fragrant, then tip out on to a board and roughly chop.Put the butter and both sugars into a large bowl or food mixer, add a pinch of salt, then beat vigorously until very light and fluffy. Grind the cloves to a fine powder and, in a separate bowl, whisk with the flour and baking powder. Beat the eggs in a cup or jug.Beat the eggs, a little at a time, into the butter and sugar mixture, until thoroughly incorporated, then use a large metal spoon to fold in the dry ingredients, being careful to knock as little air out of the mixture as possible. Finally, fold in the dates and their soaking water, plus the walnuts, if using.Take the dish out of the freezer and pour the batter on top of the sauce. Tip the dish to level out the batter, then bake for about 30 minutes, until just firm to the touch in the centre. Towards the end of the cooking time, reheat the remaining sauce in the pan.Heat the grill to medium. Using a skewer or similar, poke small holes all across the top of the baked pudding, then pour the sauce over the top. Remembering it will still be hot, put the dish under the grill until the top is molten and bubbling – keeping a watchful eye on it, because sugar is quick to burn.Serve the sticky toffee pudding immediately, with ice-cream, custard, creme fraiche or Greek yoghurt. Alternatively, bake the pudding itself ahead of time, but don’t add the remaining sauce until you’re ready to serve.

That, at least, must be the long-term hope. For now he can bask in a timely win over bitter rivals which has earned him significant respite after a desperate few weeks.Tottenham, their display as troublingly disjointed as in defeat at Burnley a few days previously and with Saturday’s derby against Arsenal looming ever larger, ended embarrassed here with Kieran Trippier inexplicably placing a back pass wide of an on-rushing Hugo Lloris six minutes from time. The ball trickled unaided over the line with Willian in hot pursuit and those in the Matthew Harding stand already bouncing gleefully in celebration. The crowing din of the home support will have pursued the visitors from the arena.The French World Cup winner had endured a hideous evening, allowing Pedro’s opener to squirm through his legs and nestle inside the near post via a flick from his right ankle, with his rather frazzled display epitomising that of the team. It was as if Chelsea tapped into that insecurity, sensing vulnerability and exploiting it ruthlessly, all while the world’s most expensive goalkeeper twiddled his thumbs among the home side’s substitutes.What had initially been dismissed in public as an innocent “misunderstanding” back at Wembley on Sunday, when Kepa Arrizabalaga had refused to be substituted by a head coach on the brink, had actually left the Spaniard £190,000 out of pocket and dropped. Yet that show of strength from Sarri, a decision made “for the good of the group” as a reminder that the priority must always be the collective, ended up feeling cathartic. Kepa’s name had drawn some boos when read out over the Tannoy before kick-off but Chelsea were a team united, galvanised by a collision with local rivals and rallying behind Willy Caballero on his first Premier League start since last May. They ended with the relationship between squad and crowd – so strained at times of late – audibly reinforced.The restoration of spirit was epitomised by David Luiz, Antonio Rüdiger and the excellent Pedro sprinting to Caballero at the final whistle to celebrate. Or César Azpilicueta, an on-field captain whose failure to usher Arrizabalaga from the pitch had drawn criticism on Sunday, muscling his way into every spat or confrontation between teammates and Spurs players which drew the referee’s whistle. The home side ended up prevailing despite Eden Hazard being visibly exhausted and withdrawn before the hour-mark, but with others stepping up to ensure Chelsea remain only three points adrift of the top four.“The result was very important because the fans saw the team able to fight,” said Sarri. “For the relationship with the fans it was really a very important match. But I am the coach. I think about my team and what is important now is consistency. To fight for 10 matches in a row. Maybe we are not able to win 10 matches in a row but we’ll be able to fight.” They make the short journey to Fulham on Sunday with faith apparently restored and their head coach, whose position had felt terminally undermined even before Kepa’s show of petulance publicly belittled his authority, suddenly spying light at the end of the tunnel.Tottenham, in contrast, might have entered the gloom. They barely tested Caballero, a mere spectator until he punched away Trippier’s free-kick just before the half-hour mark and, even if Harry Winks battered a shot on to the crossbar from distance, did not muster a shot on target for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino’s stewardship in a Premier League game, though Chelsea themselves managed only one. They were marginally off kilter all night, forever slightly off the pace with Christian Eriksen’s promptings suffocated and Harry Kane frustrated and infuriated.The England captain had squared up to David Luiz and Azpilicueta in the first half – there was a hint of a headbutt at one point – and there were further flashpoints near the end, by which time Spurs’ cause felt hopeless.Gonzalo Higuaín had struck an upright long before Pedro, fed by Azpilicueta’s pass beyond Ben Davies, had edged the hosts ahead, turning inside Toby Alderweireld before spitting a shot through Lloris’s legs at the near post. Chelsea suggested they would probably see out the win with that lead still slender before Trippier’s wayward pass and Lloris’s rush of blood further punctured the visitors late on.Spurs’ lead from fourth-placed Arsenal has been trimmed to four points before Saturday’s meeting at Wembley. “But at the beginning of the season everyone would have been satisfied to be going into this game with that gap,” said Pochettino. “The pressure is on them, not only us. Them too, surely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d532af39520d485c50b270d1ad28d9f83c4c2889/0_278_4427_2656/master/4427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf9e9702fd1db8e7697b1f1399a02f4a","title":"crystal palace manchester united premier league match report","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær had sounded the call to arms. Manchester United were in the midst of an injury crisis and it was incumbent on a big player to step up from the fringes to save them. The caretaker manager named names, too. He wanted to see Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sánchez play to their potential.It was Lukaku who delivered. The striker blew a glorious chance in the eighth minute but he did not go into his shell, far from it. He put United in control with two excellent finishes, one with either foot – the first from the edge of the penalty area – and, although Crystal Palace fought back to score through Joel Ward, it was Lukaku who helped to ensure that his team had the final word.Lukaku combined with Paul Pogba before the latter played in Ashley Young and the United captain angled home a powerful drive. Palace had fought from the first whistle but, at last, they were deflated. Down on the touchline Solskjær pumped his fists in a familiar show of contentedness.And so it goes on. Solskjær remains unbeaten in the Premier League since he stepped in to replace José Mourinho in mid-December – he has won nine and drawn two of 11 matches – and it now feels as though it is a question of when rather than if he is confirmed by the club as the next permanent manager.United want a leader to instil a fast and exciting style, to reacquaint the fans with a sense of enjoyment. They want somebody who understands the club’s traditions. And they would not mind if results came along, as well. Quite simply Solskjær has come to tick every box.Palace have never beaten United in the Premier League and they have now tried and failed on 20 occasions. This was a 16th defeat. They battled hard from the start, rattling United at times in the first half and, when Ward ed to head home, the grandstand finale was on.The home crowd bellowed their encouragement and there were flickers from their team. The substitute Max Meyer forced David de Gea into a save and Andros Townsend saw a shot charged down. But United held firm – their work rate and organisation were praised by Roy Hodgson – and after Young’s goal, there was even time for Solskjær to introduce the 17-year-old central midfielder James Garner for his debut.“We’ve got great faith in James as the next Michael Carrick,” Solskjær said. “I know it’s not fair on kids to compare them to great players like Michael was but he’s in the same mould. I know it’s pressure but you’re at Man United. Michael had the pressure of coming in after Roy Keane, so that’s just the way it is at Man United.”Solskjær radiated confidence even though he was without eight senior players because of injury. Marcus Rashford, who had been a doubt with an ankle problem, was fit enough to make a 77th-minute appearance off the bench. Solskjær could include only Pogba from his first-choice front six and he improvised by starting the full-back Diogo Dalot on the right wing, which worked well. Dalot had previously played there for Porto.All eyes were on Lukaku and Sánchez, not to mention the midfielder Fred, who made his first appearance since early January. Sánchez was a disappointment, unable to create anything and going to ground a little too easily, while Fred’s evening was a mixed bag.In the absence of Rashford, Solskjær started Lukaku through the middle and he responded with his first goals in 10 appearances, although he had to taste a low before the highs. In the 10th minute he found himself all alone and centrally placed, eight yards out, from the excellent Luke Shaw’s corner – only to sky the volley.Lukaku’s opening goal came from a much more difficult opportunity, following a burst from Shaw. The Belgian took a touch to set himself before curling a low right-foot shot into the far corner from just inside the area.Townsend had blown a clearcut 11th-minute chance from James McArthur’s cross and had fizzed a low drive past the post. Immediately after Lukaku’s breakthrough Jeffrey Schlupp stretched to meet a Townsend cross but could not direct his header on target.Hodgson described Lukaku’s second as a “cold shower” for his team and it came after Pogba had headed off-target when well placed. United won two headers inside the area following Young’s corner, firstly through Chris Smalling and then Victor Lindelöf, and Lukaku hooked the bouncing ball into the far corner.Ward’s goal from Schlupp’s cross was his first of the season. But United had too much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68479c461b46bc6a58e987b91eae75187bba9fa7/11_88_2552_1531/master/2552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4fea2910a4dbe87db495410bf9ebbc2","title":"liverpool watford premier league match report","story":"To revive an old and unfulfilled prophecy of Gérard Houllier’s, Liverpool truly are 10 games from greatness. They have faltered recently and lost their attacking verve along the route but, far from feeling the pressure of the title race, they revelled in it against Watford on Wednesday night. The Premier League leaders were insatiable, unstoppable and clinical as they recorded the biggest victory of what Jürgen Klopp hopes will be the breakthrough season for his club.The Liverpool manager gave an Oscar-winner’s speech, eulogising all those who had made the victory possible and acknowledging he may have forgotten somebody. It was a lengthy list. Mohamed Salah was “unplayable” according to Klopp. Trent Alexander‑Arnold “brilliant” as he returned to the side with vengeance plus a hat-trick of inch-perfect assists. Fabinho appeared to run central midfield single-handedly, although that does a disservice to those around him. Sadio Mané scored twice, the second an audacious and glorious finish, as did Virgil van Dijk with two towering late headers. Divock Origi chipped in with a fine goal as he replaced Roberto Firmino.Strength in depth, a clean sheet and a rampant team brushing aside a side in “best of the rest” territory before kick-off. It was a result and performance that blew away creeping suspicions about Liverpool losing their edge and composure just as the season enters its critical phase. It was a result and performance that told Manchester City they will be difficult to dislodge. And it was needed. Three draws in the previous four league games demanded a reaction, despite Klopp’s claim it is growing expectation that afflicts Liverpool, and another heavy defeat of Watford – who have lost here 5-0, 5-0 and 6-1 on their past three visits – was timed as perfectly as it was executed.Klopp sowed doubt in Watford from the start by stationing Origi on the left and handing Mané opportunity to wreak havoc through the centre. It was an invitation he devoured. Other changes from Manchester United on Sunday, James Milner returning to midfield and Alexander-Arnold recalled at right-back, were also key in extending Liverpool’s unbeaten league run here to a commanding 35 games.Milner signalled the kind of night that lay in store for the visitors when he charged down an early clearance from Ben Foster. The Watford goalkeeper escaped on that occasion, the ball looping into the air and his embrace, but was convincingly beaten when a carefully constructed attack released Mané for the first time.He was involved at the start of the move with a lay-off to Milner on the edge of the area. By the time the ball arrived in the box via an immaculate first time cross from Alexander-Arnold, the Senegal international had peeled into space between Watford’s central defenders. Foster was left waving at thin air as Mané’s powerful header flew into the top corner.Quality deliveries from Alexander-Arnold were a feature of Liverpool’s first-half dominance as the defender showed his manager what was lacking at Old Trafford. Salah’s tormenting of Adam Masina and Craig Cathcart was another. Both played their part in a second goal of impudent class from Mané.A strong run from Salah was halted inside the area but Liverpool remained in possession through Georginio Wijnaldum. He teed up Alexander-Arnold for another precision cross into Mané whose first touch shifted the ball away from goal. No bother. He simply back-heeled his second touch up and over the advancing Foster and into an empty net. The gasp that preceded the roar around the ground said everything about the finish.Fear stalked the Watford defence each time Salah received the ball in space, a lesson they failed to heed from United’s approach at Old Trafford. The paucity of the visitors’ attacking display was summed up by Javi Gracia withdrawing both of his forwards, Troy Deeney and the erratic Gerard Deulofeu, in a double substitution.Inevitably, it was Liverpool who struck again when Origi capped a promising return to the starting line-up with a fine finish. Andy Robertson found the striker lurking unmarked on the left wing with Watford defending deep and in numbers. Undeterred, the Belgium international darted into the area and away from two defenders before cutting a low and emphatic shot back inside Foster’s near post.Van Dijk made it four when he powered home a close range header from Alexander-Arnold’s free-kick. He celebrated his second goal at Anfield with a fist-pumping celebration in front of the Kop and followed that up with a glancing header past Foster from Robertson’s cross three minutes later.

No other side has managed that kind of record over a 15-game period in the top ision since Tottenham in 1965 and, in the case of Pep Guardiola’s team, their previous assignment here was a 6-0 rampage against Chelsea.At this stage of the season, however, they will not mind too much that their latest victory was a more prosaic affair featuring a penalty decision that must have hurt their opponents. On the balance of play, there could be no doubt City were the superior team, particularly when Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling added some much-needed impetus during the second half. All the same their former manager, Manuel Pellegrini, could conceivably have seen his current team emerge with a battling draw but for the contentious moment just before the hour mark when Silva went down under Felipe Anderson’s largely innocuous challenge and Sergio Agüero was handed the chance to continue his scoring run.That was Agüero’s 25th goal of the season and, more importantly, it ensured City kept up the pressure on Liverpool at the top of the table. Yet it was a struggle at times for the reigning champions, epitomised by Guardiola replacing his leading scorer towards the end with a midfielder, Phil Foden, and the unusual sight of Kevin De Bruyne trying to waste a few seconds in stoppage time by running the ball towards the corner flag.A single-goal victory, settled by a moment of controversy, was certainly not what many City fans might have anticipated when, to put it into context, Guardiola had won all six of his previous encounters against these opponents, with an aggregate score of 22-3. On that basis West Ham ought to be reasonably encouraged, particularly as Marko Arnautovic was absent with a virus and Ben Johnson was making his first Premier League start. As the cousin of Ledley King and nephew of Paul Parker, Johnson, a 19-year-old full-back, comes from a family that clearly places great importance on the art of defence, and that was probably just as well given the amount of time West Ham had to spend in retreat.Not that City had it all their own way. Guardiola’s body language was telling at times, staring out anxiously from the dugout or moving to the edge of the pitch, arms folded or hands shoved into his pockets. He claimed afterwards he was “delighted” that his team had played “so good.” During the game, however, he looked dissatisfied and at times the crowd sounded it, too, particularly when Riyad Mahrez was straying offside or misplacing passes. This was Mahrez’s first start in a league match since 30 December and, though Sterling and Silva were entitled to a rest, it was not a good night for the club’s record signing, looking conspicuously low on confidence and substituted early in the second half.The same could be said for Samir Nasri, who was barely involved for West Ham on the night he returned to face his former club. Pellegrini replaced him with Lanzini at the break and, five minutes after the restart, the substitute set up Andy Carroll for West Ham’s first chance of the night. It was a splendid chance, too – by far the clearest opportunity until that stage. Carroll was at full stretch when he connected with Lanzini’s cross but Ederson’s flying save spared City from going behind.For West Ham it was a costly save. Silva, a 58th-minute replacement for Leroy Sané, had been on the pitch only a minute when he tried to get past Anderson in the penalty area. Declan Rice, who was being watched by the England manager, Gareth Southgate, was also tracking the City player and it was a questionable decision from the referee, Stuart Attwell.Silva appeared to stumble rather than actually being fouled, and the sight of him punching the air at the award of the penalty will not have lessened West Ham’s feelings of injustice. Agüero put the penalty to the left of Lukasz Fabianski and, after that, West Ham were indebted to their goalkeeper, particularly for a one-handed save from Sterling that prevented it becoming the kind of scoreline to which City are accustomed at their own ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ccffe7cf87fc04e0972892806a237092d75fdd5/0_231_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2716c4f464e749d348e4cc1dc10fffb3","title":"real madrid barcelona copa del rey match report","story":"For Barcelona, there is something about the Santiago Bernabéu. They came to the home of their greatest rivals needing a victory to take them to a record sixth consecutive Copa del Rey final and while that task may appear titanic for most teams, Barça are not most teams: they have made a habit of silencing this stadium and they did so againon Wednesday, two goals from Luis Suárez and an own goal from Raphaël Varane completing a 3-0 win to go with the 6-2, 4-3, 3-2, 4-0 and 3-1 victories they have collected here in the last decade.If those were successes secured on a superiority that was often startling, this was different, but in the end Barcelona went through. They had struggled for an hour but survived and prevailed. It was not easy to explain, except through extreme efficiency: two of Barcelona’s four shots were on target and they scored three. Madrid had 14 in total and did not score.“We’re sad because we wanted to reach the final. We fell with honour: we weren’t ruthless, they were very ruthless,” the Madrid manager, Santi Solari, said. The Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, admitted his team had not always played well but had displayed “pegada” – the knockout punch.Nor was this about a familiar genius: so dependent on Lionel Messi lately, this time his influence was largely incidental instead, the combination of Ousmane Dembélé and Suárez, neither of whom were especially sparkling in truth, defeated Madrid. The Uruguayan has scored 11 in 13 clásicos.Until Suárez scored the first goal a little after half-time, that appeared barely plausible. Madrid, who had the advantage of an away goal from the 1-1 first-leg draw, seemed more likely to progress, their path to the final passing through Vinicius, the 18-year-old who has revived their season. But if the threat was always there, it went unrealised. Barcelona for their part threatened rarely but when they struck they were deadly.It had started with Vinicius’s early flick sending Sergio Reguilón up the left, Barcelona turned for the first but not the last time, Karim Benzema usually the man making sense of the runs around him. Vinicius drew a penalty appeal shot just over and had another effort blocked by Marc-André ter Stegen. Then the Brazilian, hyperactive, dashed through and eventually found Benzema, only for the Frenchman’s weak shot to hit the keeper. Within a minute, the Brazilian hit over on the turn from close range.By half-time, there had been no goals – not normal for a clásico, 50 of them passing without a 0-0. Nor was the solitary Barcelona shot, if it could be called that: an Ivan Rakitic drive quickly closed down. But then, five minutes after the restart, they got the opener. Jordi Alba slotted the ball to Dembélé who pulled it back and Suárez, swifter and more alert than Sergio Ramos, steered a superb first-time shot into the net.Madrid chased the equaliser, Sergio Busquets sliding in to stop Vinicius after he brilliantly turned away from Piqué and Sergio Reguilón’s cross just evading Lucas Vázquez before Dani Carvajal’s shot was saved and a another Vinicius run concluded with the ball squirming wide. Gareth Bale watched from the touchline. He was introduced to applause but a few whistles too, quickly followed by a cheer from the other end where the hundred or so Barcelona fans saw Semedo find Dembélé. His sharp ball into the six-yard box sought Suárez but found Varane, ing in, and the ball rebounded into the net.Suárez scored again two minutes later. Brought down by Casemiro, he got up and dinked in a Panenka penalty that took Barcelona to the cup final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fd06728f57dfd3b3371e2b343de93819af3fa2d/192_172_3984_2391/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ff8177ff62729d01d0034d9184c9f8","title":"england women brazil women shebelieves cup match report","story":"Beth Mead lashed home a second-half winner as England made a strong start to their SheBelieves Cup campaign in Philadelphia with victory over Brazil.England had trailed to an early Andressa Alves penalty but equalised through Ellen White shortly after the break before Mead’s long-range effort grabbed the points with 16 minutes to go.It was an impressive recovery from Phil Neville’s side who face further games against the United States and Japan in the four-team tournament as they continue preparations for this summer’s World Cup in France.But Neville will have been far from happy with some of his side’s defensive sluggishness, which contributed to them falling behind in the 15th minute.An error by Steph Houghton was seized upon by Marta and the Brazilian star surged into the box where Lucy Bronze was rather harshly adjudged to have barged her over.Andressa sent the Chelsea goalkeeper Carly Telford the wrong way from the spot and Brazil were relatively comfortable holding on to their lead despite half-chances for Nikita Parris and Fran Kirby.England started the second half with much more purpose and were level within four minutes when Birmingham striker White steered a low left-foot shot across Brazil keeper Aline after being played in by Kirby.Parris could have put England in front after surging into the right side of the Brazil box only to fire straight at Aline instead of squaring for White, who lurked unmarked in front of goal.But Mead made up for that error of judgment less than 10 minutes later when she picked up the ball outside the box on the right and, spotting Aline off her line, smashed home a rising effort from a tight angle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03da5addf97321b7acb4afcfee8078484a1f3521/0_139_2055_1233/master/2055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37f7d5e42f72e8411d53919a5ca507c7","title":"chelsea v tottenham premier league live","story":"Tottenham’s title hopes took a serious blow at Stamford Bridge.Dominic Fifield was our man at Stamford Bridge. Here’s his verdict. Thanks for reading. That’s all, folks!Mauricio Pochettino also talks to BT Sport. “It was an even game. In some situations they dominate, in others we dominate. They had one shot on target and scored, we had zero and so it was impossible to score. And impossible to draw. It wasn’t a great game to watch. They have a lot of quality but it was an even game. It was a bad night for us. The north London derby is a tough fixture for us, and then we have the Champions League. It’s good when you win, win, win, so when you lose and lose it’s important to be calm.”Maurizio Sarri talks! “I think the performance was in line with the last one. But fortunately the result was different. The performance was really very similar to the one against Manchester City. Pedro is a very important player for us. He is dangerous, can score, but he is also good defensively and balances the team. I was sure before the match that the relationship with my players is very very good, and in the last month I think better. Caballero is a good goalkeeper with great experience. He is a great man and very important on the pitch and in the dressing room. We need consistency.”Willy Caballero speaks. “Of course we are happy. It’s a great result for us after the last game, and I think now we have to enjoy it, because every game for us is a lot of effort. We defended fantastically. Every victory is important, to be a little bit closer to Tottenham. We are behind a lot of teams but we will recover well. Always a clean sheet is a satisfaction. We spoke about what happened the other day, and the very good news is that Kepa was fantastic today, he supported me, and he learned, and we are improving as a team.”A poetic cry from the heart, courtesy of Dom CFK. “I must admit being a Spurs fan from a Spurs family breeds an odd kind of gallows fatalism, even in these more gallant times, so I’ve been expecting not only wheels to come off, but gaskets to be blown and engine blocks to explode in spectacular fashion. Like Grace Jones, pick the motoring metaphor for being shafted you prefer. But curiously for a while I’ve been wrong.“However, something about the run of Burnley (suddenly OK after big doldrums), Chelsea (an exploding clown car of a club every day bar today no doubt) and The Arse (what week is it? well who knows) made my gut feel zero points from nine. And, especially with recent talk of title races and ‘cup finals’, I think it’s on.“All I needed to see on the MBM was Pedro’s (Pedro!) smiling face as the picture header for confirmation. Glad to see Trippier finally making a contribution this season by burying one in his own net.“We will probably have a frightening squeak through the Champions League next round, but then it’s stutters, splutters and fifth to look forward to, with the last game of the season being played in a car park in Chigwell to confirm we’ve scraped into the Europa League.That’s a great result for Chelsea, who were by far the better team in the second half and thoroughly deserved their win. A great evening for Maurizio Sarri and the faultless Willy Caballero, too. The crowd celebrate accordingly. They’re still in sixth place on 53 points, but have a game in hand on fifth-placed Manchester United (55) and fourth-placed Arsenal (56). Worryingly for Spurs, who started the week thinking about the title, they’re now nine points behind leaders Liverpool, eight behind Manchester City ... and only four ahead of Arsenal. It’s going to be some north-London derby at the weekend!And that’s the final whistle! No big brawl this time, but Tottenham’s title hopes are now hanging by a very slender thread.90 min +3: Kane prepares to take a throw and gets into a childish tussle with Luiz. Both are booked for their playground nonsense. 90 min +2: A throw for Chelsea down the right. Pedro links arms with Rose. He’s enjoying the tussle, laughing and smiling. Rose has a sense-of-humour failure and shoves him back. Not hard enough to warrant censure, but enough for the Chelsea crowd to give him a bit of stick.90 min +1: Rose has replaced Sissoko, by the way.90 min: There will be three added minutes. They can’t tick round quickly enough for Spurs, who just want to head back north.89 min: It’s difficult to work out who was more at fault, Trippier or Lloris. Should the keeper have hared out to the edge of his box to receive the backpass? Or should Trippier have looked up to see where his keeper was upon making it? Questions, questions, as we said all the way back in the preamble.87 min: Down the other end, Cabellero celebrated that second goal with great feeling. He’s done little wrong tonight. To think all eyes were on him at the start of the game, and now look what’s happened to poor Lloris.86 min: “It’s happened again. Tottenham Hotspur, it’s happened again.” Chelsea fans sticking in the knife and twisting hard, as Tottenham’s title challenge crumbles in farcical circumstances.The ball’s launched long. Giroud flicks it on to nobody. Trippier, under no pressure whatsoever, just needs to roll the ball back to Lloris. But his keeper has sprinted out to the edge of the box. Trippier’s backpass rolls wide right of the keeper, and trundles comically into the unguarded net. Oh dear oh dear oh dear.84 min: Higuain is replaced by Giroud. Then ...83 min: Eriksen’s weak shot sails wide right. Cabellero was behind it all the way.82 min: Tottenham are threatening to lose the rag. Kane thinks about engaging with Rudiger, then Sissoko chest-barges Azpilicueta, who to be fair was getting up in his grille. They could do with keeping their heads as they look for the equaliser - and late winner - they’re so desperate for.80 min: Lucas Moura comes on for Son.79 min: Trippier crosses from a deep position on the right. He’s looking for Kane, lurking near the right-hand post, but Azpilicueta is on hand to shepherd the ball back to Caballero.77 min: Chelsea make their second change of the night. Kovacic is replaced by Loftus-Cheek.76 min: Kante backs himself in a footrace with Alderweireld down the right, knocking the ball into space and then tearing after it. He just about wins it, then flicks it inside for Pedro, who in turn flicks down the inside-right channel. Higuain would have been clear on goal, but didn’t quite read Pedro’s intention and found himself in the wrong place, the ball bouncing harmlessly away from him. Would have been a cute move.74 min: Trippier crosses again from the right. Llorente rises to compete, but Luiz slams a header clear.73 min: Trippier crosses from the right. The ball finds Llorente, eight yards out, level with the right-hand post. It’ll be half a chance if he can take it down, but he lets the ball ping off his knee and out for a goal kick. Very poor.72 min: Wide on the right, Pedro sends a speculative curler towards the top left. It’s not that far away. Willian then wins a corner on the opposite flank, though the resulting set piece is a waste of time. Chelsea are looking very comfortable right now. Spurs are doing nothing at all.70 min: And that’s Lamela’s last contribution to the evening’s entertainment. He’s replaced by Llorente.69 min: Spurs are looking very jittery at the moment. Sissoko has his pocket picked by Kovacic on the halfway line. Chelsea ping it around awhile. Lamela intercepts the ball, but then immediately falls over, skidding across the turf on his face. He even tries to smother the ball with his arms, in the hope of stopping Kante regaining possession, but can’t even achieve that. A slightly farcical episode.67 min: Sissoko toils to earn a corner off Luiz out on the right. Alderweireld rises highest to meet the set piece, but under pressure from Alonso, can only eyebrow a weak header miles wide left.65 min: This might not be Tottenham’s night. Davies crosses from the left. The ball’s dropping to Kane, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. It’s the sort of chance he slams home so often, but gets his body in the wrong shape and sends a soft volley squirting harmlessly left of goal.63 min: Lamela and Son shuttle the ball into the Chelsea box from the right. Son slips a pass left for Eriksen, who drops a shoulder to make space to shoot. From nowhere, Pedro comes in from behind and strips Eriksen of possession with a stunning sliding tackle! Pedro then dribbles away from the danger zone. Sensational defensive work from the goalscorer!62 min: Son threatens to dribble into the Chelsea box from the right, but he slows up and is quickly swarmed. Uncharacteristically ponderous play from Son.60 min: Hazard, who has been quiet tonight, makes way for Willian.59 min: Eriksen, mindful that Spurs need to do something if their title hopes are to stay alive, has a dig from distance. The shot bobbles harmlessly wide left. Hazard, to the left of the centre circle, spreads play to the right for Azpilicueta, who shuttles it further down the wing for Pedro. Pedro dribbles hard into the area, drops a shoulder to nick past Alderweireld, and slams a shot towards the bottom right corner. The pace surprises Lloris at his near post, the ball flashing through his legs and in. On the touchline, Sarri celebrates with great feeling.56 min: Spurs show in the Chelsea box for the first time in a while. Lamela dribbles down the inside left and chips into the centre, but Rudiger had taken the pace off the ball and it’s an easy claim for Caballero.55 min: Hazard drives fast and hard down the middle of the park. He’s got options either side, so Davies does extremely well to intercept just before Hazard can decide what to do. Hazard wanted a foul, but the ref’s simply not responsive to that sort of request this evening, so he might as well be whistling Dixie.53 min: Jorginho clips a cute pass down the inside-right channel to release Higuain, who sashays into the box, draws Lloris, and chips daintily over the keeper and into the net. But it won’t count he went a split second too early, and the offside flag springs up. Lovely finish, though.52 min: It’s gone scrappy again. Luiz was a bit unhappy when Lamela clipped him late, but there wasn’t much in it and he didn’t get the foul.50 min: Hazard sends Kante scooting down the right with a fine crossfield ball. Azpilicueta is fed on the overlap. The resulting cross is too high for Hazard. Chelsea have seen plenty of the ball in Tottenham’s final third since half time, but it’s not quite firing for them at the business end.48 min: Chelsea have been on the front foot since the restart. Pedro dribbles down the left now, and is only just stopped from getting a shot away by the toe of Alderweireld. The ball breaks to Alonso, whose low snapshot is deflected away from danger.47 min: Alonso, still getting pelters, sprays a wonderful left-to-right pass towards Pedro, who dribbles into the area then lays off for Higuain. The striker crosses to the far post where there’s ... nobody. The ball bobbles out apologetically for a goal kick. The crowd groan in unison.46 min: No half-time changes, by the way. And it’s a fast start to the half as Higuain dribbles in from the left and pearls a shot from the edge of the box. Alderweireld blocks well.Chelsea get the second half underway. With Manchester United and Arsenal both currently winning, 1-0 at Crystal Palace and 3-1 at home to Bournemouth respectively, the hosts will be desperate to keep up in the chase for fourth place. They’ll need to improve if they want all three points ... but then again so do Spurs. “Something’s been missing,” agrees Matt Dony. “What this game needs is more Clattenburg.”Both teams have hit the frame of the goal. It’s nearly kicked off once or twice. Other than that, it’s been a relatively quiet match so far by Chelsea-Tottenham standards. Plenty of time left yet.45 min: Spurs have turned it up a notch. Son dribbles hard down the right, reaches the byline, and fizzes a low ball across the face of goal. Caballero fingertips it away from the lurking Kane. Chelsea eventually clear.44 min: Winks, 25 yards out down the inside-right channel, sends a spectacular looping shot over the fully extended Caballero and off the crossbar! That wasn’t far from dropping into the top left ... but had it been the necessary inch or two lower, the keeper probably had it covered. Though I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.42 min: Kane takes matters into his own hands by driving in the old-fashioned style down the inside-left channel. He takes a whack from the edge of the box but his shot is deflected out by Azpilicueta. The resulting corner is played out to Davies by the left of the D his cross clanks off his boot and out for a goal kick, nowhere near any player on the park.41 min: This match began in very entertaining fashion. It’s now descended into low-quality nonsense. Two-pass moves are at a premium, and neither set of fans sound particularly happy about it. An awful lot of groaning going on.39 min: Kovacic, out on the left, rolls a pass inside for Kante, who takes a shot from the best part of 30 yards. It flies harmlessly over the crossbar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2c8a1a9789a80d771488ead964f627f5bb7809/0_47_3176_1905/master/3176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff899270200a31c978000d61c342bb0e","title":"liverpool v watford manchester city v west ham and more live","story":"Copa del Rey: Sid Lowe was at the Bernabeu to see Real Madrid humbled by a Barcelona side that has qualified for its sixth consecutive Spanish Cup final.

He left his job in corporate marketing to buy the pub in 2015 when it was due to be lost for good.He said he had been left “speechless” by the win. “All I wanted to do was to get the little Wonston Arms pub in the Good Beer Guide annually, getting in there was mission accomplished. I saw that as a huge step … but once I got in the guide, there aren’t any pubs left doing what we are doing,” Todd said.He added that the place was unique in that it was a “traditional English boozer”. He said it had grown in popularity due to word of mouth as opposed to extensive marketing.“People keep coming to see it and telling more friends, and we got into the last 16 last year, and this year, blimey, we are the best pub in country according to beer drinkers … I am flabbergasted and stunned – our little pub has beaten off the big boys,” Todd said.Last year, the Wonston Arms, near Sutton Scotney, picked up the award for best pub in the region.Todd explained that the community put in a bid to save the pub three years before he had enough money to buy it, but they came up £75,000 short. He said this attempt to take it over lengthened the pub’s “stay of execution” and allowed him to gather the money he needed to make the investment.“I was ready in April 2015 and bought the freehold myself, outright … but that connection with the community was never lost. I said if I do this guys, although you are not putting money in, work with me. The community came together to renovate the pub,” he added.Todd said making the leap from the corporate world to becoming a landlord was a big step. “It cost me hundreds of thousands to buy it – a genuinely massive purchase,” he said.The Wonston Arms is also the heart of fundraising for the local area. It has generated in excess of £25,000 from the pub community. Every month, it hosts a pop-up cafe, which has raised more than £7,000 for local charitable causes.The local MP, Steve Brine, said: “The pub trade is not easy these days, to put it mildly. In this context, it is even more impressive what Matt Todd and the team have achieved. The fact he’s done so while staying so true to the values of real ale, a decent local pint and community is just great.”Ben Wilkinson, the national pub of the year coordinator, said: “Matt and his team have created a fantastic rural village pub with a great atmosphere, by shaping it around the community and its needs. They have realised that it takes something special to create a sense of real belonging so that people want to come out of their homes and back in the pub.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_77_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e56926aabb0350cafaa217a56b8c89","title":"guardian supporters future journalism","story":"By opting for a reader-funded business model, we rely on readers to support our groundbreaking independent journalism.

I worked at both EMI and PolyGram (where they later signed to Polydor) and remember being staggered at the ambition, scope and sound of the albums he delivered. In my opinion, way beyond anything anyone else was doing at the time. Today, on my way to do the shopping I will listen once again to the music of a man who I genuinely think was a genius.Anybody who has never experienced the album, please do yourself a favour and sit down and listen to it. It is not instant and needs working at to appreciate it. But what that is brilliant comes to you without hard work? It needs time and works in its entirety as it does not have a “hit” anywhere near it. It is not designed for, nor does it work in today’s Spotify or iTunes single track format, nor did it for radio andor MTV at the time. The compression that the internet gives does no justice to the atmosphere achieved on the original vinyl either. But I will guarantee that once it has got into you, it will be with you forever, like all good things will satisfy your soul. A genuine masterpiece. Leon DepopeIt’s funny how things affect you. It makes no difference functionally, since Mark Hollis disappeared from public life in 1998, and I certainly never met him, but I’m heartbroken.He said (and I’m very much paraphrasing here) that he’d done everything he set out to do with those later albums, Laughing Stock especially, and that’s why he slowed down and eventually stopped. I suppose because he was able to express himself so perfectly, to listen to those records is to know him intimately. I always loved who I heard in them. A sweet soul, and an awkward bastard. I still cry every time I listen to Laughing Stock after more than a decade of listening to it on average every few days.Even if I imagined the person I heard, It makes me so sad to know that he’s not around any more. So effortly blessed. Andrew SamoyedIf there’s such a thing as a vibration of the human spirit, Mark Hollis knew how to make music to match its timbre.What an amazing, profound, integrity filled man he was. With some musicians you always look at their careers and think what might have been. Well, there’s no such regrets here.Farewell Mark, you’ve given me more inspiration then any artist on this planet. jesusjuice89We’ve lost a great, singular talent. Together with his bandmates in Talk Talk he produced some of the most incredible music to have ever emerged from the UK. Talk Talk’s progression over five records is utterly ridiculous. Genius.Living in the Netherlands, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy, the essence of my Englishness. AnhagaTo this day I still listen in awe at what manifests forth and out of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock especially in the darkest hours of time and of the soul. I cannot put my finger on it but as I get immersed in all the storm, swirl and silence of the music all I ever experience is light and rapture. To me they are the most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to, and yet I can only listen to them alone, the experience is too personal and intense to share. They are the most spiritual musical experience I have ever had and I cannot begin to document how much of an impact they have had on me and my life. Thank you, Mark Hollis. thegreatdarginiI’m struggling on this one so unexpected. I always had this feeling he’d just emerge again one day, drop an album – no fuss, no build-up … and, of course, it would be perfect. Just like Laughing Stock, just like the solo album and, of course, just like Spirit of Eden. When most of the music from the end of the 20th century is long forgotten those albums will still be played, admired and loved.Thanks (along with Paul and Lee) for helping to soundtrack my life, Mark. Love to your friends and family. As the trees come into leaf over the next few weeks I’ll do what I always do at this time of year - play The Colour of Spring over and over again. Mitch44I first heard Spirit of Eden when I was a sixth-form student almost 30 years ago. I’d heard nothing like it in my life. I knew of the early New Romantic Talk Talk, and some pretty catchy songs, but this? It was just from a different world ... I must have listened to that album thousands of times since and it still gives me goosebumps. There is simply nothing much to compare it with – perhaps only Laughing Stock and Hollis’s wonderful solo album.Some say that Bark Psychosis are their nearest comparison. They’re good, but they’re not Talk Talk. And Hex is great, but it’s not Spirit of Eden. Nothing can top that ... I always held out a faint hope he’d break cover and give us something new to wonder over. Sadly, what was always likely is now certain. Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time. There will be goosebumps, all over again ... thanks Mark, you were a genius.

MPs would be able to amend votes on future EU workers’ rights legislation, meaning they can potentially force the government to accept new rules.Unions, including Unite, were expected to be consulted in the final stages of preparing the statement, though the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, has been publicly sceptical about the guarantees.It is unclear whether the final package of measures will be offered as a separate bill, which some Labour MPs have demanded, or as part of the EU withdrawal bill, which other Labour MPs prefer because they believe it would be harder to unpick.Labour MPs who support the new measures are unsure how many more colleagues will be won over by them. “I don’t know how many more people’s minds this is going to shift,” one said.A Downing Street source said the timing of the announcement had not been finalised, though it would be before the meaningful vote. The prime minister may hold the vote next week, before the 12 March deadline, depending on when the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is able to reach an agreement with Brussels.In her statement to the Commons on Tuesday, May promised to give parliament a vote on whether it wished to follow EU standards in areas such as workers’ rights and health and safety. She also pledged that the government would consult with businesses and trade unions when it looked at new EU legislation.The prime minister promised to give the commitments force in UK law, without specifying the form this would take.May has been talking to a small group of Labour MPs who have been pushing for the guarantees, including the former minister Caroline Flint and the backbenchers John Mann and Gareth Snell.Snell robustly defended the group’s actions in an exchange during the Brexit debate, saying: “I have spoken to the prime minister about workers’ rights, funding for our towns post-Brexit, and what we need to do to find a way through this. Some of my colleagues have labelled those things as bribes, but they are wrong what we are trying to do is find a constructive way forward.”James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, is expected to announced a £1.6bn Brexit fund, spread over seven years, for towns and coastal communities. Government sources said they hoped it would be announced before the next meaningful vote.The fund was intended for 26 of the 38 “local enterprise partnerships” and none of it would go to London. Regions such as the Black Country, Greater Manchester and other Midlands regions, for example, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, were likely to get the most significant funding, according to the Sun.May confirmed at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday that there would be a fund to “ensure our towns can grow and prosper”, but declined to give further details."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e958c073813e4d5985cb865a8b4ee7a226f90678/34_91_1401_840/master/1401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c60f9ff48978c8c0396beef4cfad8b2","title":"six out of eight border it systems may not be ready for no deal","story":"National Audit Office warns of lack of Brexit preparations at UK border and by tradersSix out of eight critical IT systems required to allow the UK’s borders to function under a no-deal Brexit are in danger of not being ready, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found.The National Audit Office has also concluded that with 31 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU, the readiness of UK’s businesses are a “red-rated” risk if the government crashes out of Europe.The findings were released on Wednesday evening in a memo sent to the public accounts committee.Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said serious questions remained about whether the UK would be prepared at the border, and what this would mean for iniduals and businesses.“It is alarming that six of the eight critical IT systems needed are in danger of not being ready in time and that government assesses readiness of traders as one of its most significant risks,” she said.The report examined eight systems at the border across departments including HM Revenue and Customs, Defra, the Food Standards Agency and the Department for International Trade.One IT project, the Automatic Licence Verification System – which was meant to allow the importation of regulated horticultural, plants, live animals and animal products – had deteriorated since last September, the report found. The Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System, developed to control the importation of animals and high-risk food and feed from the EU, still had the same risk profile as six months ago, auditors said.Auditors noted that this month civil servants rated the risk to trader readiness as “red-rated”.A government spokesperson said the report showed “real progress” had been made at the UK’s borders. “We have also taken steps to minimise disruption through phasing in certain checks required at the border and continuing to apply the risk-based approach to customs checks we use today,” he said.“The necessary resources we need to keep the border secure will be in place, including an additional 900 Border Force officers by March 2019, and we’ve been communicating extensively with businesses about the steps they need to take to prepare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c572f9750a34d1dcce017792b67efdc40e7c9b64/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2efeb0d814731c821a32e50bc49c23db","title":"brexit debate latest news developments pmqs chair jacob rees mogg drops his calls for wholesale removal of backstop politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the Commons debate on the next Brexit stepsThe voting turned out to be more interesting than we expected.

An ultrasound of the 28-year old mother at six weeks suggested the twins were identical – with signs including a shared placenta. But it soon became clear all was not as it seemed.Twins are normally either identical or fraternal. In the case of identical, one egg is fertilised by one sperm, but the resulting ball of cells splits in two, giving rise to two offspring with identical genetic material. In the case of fraternal, or non-identical, twins, two eggs are fertilised, each by a different sperm. The resulting siblings arise from the same pregnancy, but are no more genetically similar than siblings from the same parents born at a different time.Faced with a puzzling scenario, Gabbett and colleagues report in the New England Journal of Medicine that they took samples from the two amniotic sacs, allowing them to investigate the genomes of the twins during the pregnancy.The results, they say, reveal a very unusual situation: the twins are semi-identical or “sesquizygotic”. “What we have got is a sequence of unusual events,” said Gabbett.The situation is believed to arise when two sperm cells fertilise a single egg. In the latest case, one sperm carried an X chromosome among its genetic material, and the other carried a Y chromosome.After fertilisation the chromosomes from the two sperm cells and the single egg got bundled into three “genetic packages”: one contained chromosomes from both sperm – meaning it contained two sets of genetic material from the father, but none from the mother. The other two packages each contained the same set of chromosomes from the mother, as well as genetic material from one of the two sperm, giving rise to either XX (female) or XY (male) cells.As the fertilised egg ided and the ball of cells grew, those containing only chromosomes from the two sperm died. However, those containing chromosomes from both the egg and a sperm cell continued to ide.“Then what happens is that little ball of cells splits into two, and that is why you have twins,” said Gabbett, adding that these offspring have a greater genetic similarity than fraternal twins, but are not identical.But the situation is not that straightforward: some of both embryos’ cells contained two X chromosomes, while other cells contained an X and a Y chromosome.Gabbett added since one twin was a boy and the other a girl, the ratio of each of these types of cell differed: one embryo contained a greater number of XY cells, so developed male, while the other had a high proportion of XX cells and developed female.The only previously reported case of sesquizygotic twins came from the US in 2007, discovered after one of the children was born with ambiguous genitalia. The team say the children in the latest report had no such ambiguities.However, the case was not without complications. While the children were delivered by caesarean section and appeared healthy, it was found the baby girl had developed a blood clot shortly before birth. Her arm was amputated when she was four weeks old.Then at the age of three, the girl had her ovaries removed as it was found they had not fully formed, which can increase the risk of a certain type of cancer – a situation that was down to her genetic makeup.Gabbett said that while there might be other, unreported, cases of sesquizygotic twins, it remains a very unusual phenomenon. Among their investigations, the team looked back at genetic data for nearly 1,000 pairs of what were thought to be fraternal twins, but found no other cases.“It is incredibly rare so we don’t think it is something people should be routinely tested for or worried about,” said Gabbett. But, he added, it challenges conventional thinking. “We traditionally categorise twins as either identical or non-identical, and this is a third type of twinning characterisation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53cfb68828dbfddd66d8be86c41a57e365611a13/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7310ed3a962ace7d8bea32bd180631ae","title":"diabetics eating disorder diabulimia","story":"Diabulimia, which can be fatal, occurs if type 1 diabetics stop taking insulin to lose weightDiabetics who also have a rare and potentially fatal eating disorder are to start receiving specialist NHS help to reduce their risk of suffering its “devastating” consequences.About 55,000 people in England with type 1 diabetes also have diabulimia, which occurs when a person with the condition stops taking insulin regularly because they want to lose weight.Support from nurses and counsellors for people with diabulimia will include advice on how to prevent harmful social media postings from affecting their behaviour.Leading doctors and health charities said the little-known condition can lead to a stroke, kidney failure, an amputation, blindness or even death.NHS England is bringing specialists in diabetes and eating disorder care, who usually work separately, into new combined teams that will help patients in London and on the south coast.Hundreds of people will be treated by teams centred on King’s College hospital in the capital and Royal Bournemouth hospital in Dorset. NHS England hopes the pilots will show health professionals the best way to treat those with diabulimia.An estimated 42,000 women and 13,000 men in England who have type 1 diabetes – the autoimmune version of the disease, which is not linked to lifestyle – also have diabulimia. People with type 2 diabetes cannot get it.Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England’s national clinical director for diabetes and obesity, said: “As a diabetes clinician I’ve seen first-hand the devastating impact that this condition can have on people and their families, and so these services are an important step forward in the recognition of diabulimia.”Many people with diabulimia do not tell friends and family they are not taking regular doses of insulin, which adds to the difficulties NHS staff face in spotting those who have it.Most type 1 diabetics who skip doses of insulin do so to reduce the weight gain that taking it can involve.Diabetes UK said: “Diabulimia is serious, but it’s not a recognised mental health condition in its own right. And because it isn’t widely understood, some healthcare professionals may not spot the signs or know how to support someone with it.”The Labour MP George Howarth has been campaigning to raise awareness of diabulimia since his daughter Sian died from it aged 24 in 2011.Dr Dasha Nicholls, the chairwoman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ eating disorders faculty, said: “Because diabetes forces you to focus on what you eat, it is not unusual for that to get tangled up with feelings about food, weight and body image.“But in the case of diabetes that can become dangerous very quickly, because of the impact on blood sugar levels.”Welcoming the announcement, Tom Quinn, the director of external affairs at the eating disorders charity Beat, said: “Standard treatments for people with eating disorders often don’t provide the right support for people who also have diabetes, who may experience additional issues including the misuse of insulin and its extremely serious consequences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d387badd9cf6cb237b1e836eb222ad8dee792dc/0_111_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6718bf45537d0b08a46604066bfbc48a","title":"labour to push for stricter online gambling regulations","story":"Deputy leader Tom Watson to call for major overhaul of law to stop ‘gross excesses’Labour is to propose an overhaul of online gambling law, including new restrictions on how much customers can bet and a system of checks to stop people placing wagers they cannot afford.The deputy leader, Tom Watson, will say on Thursday that a series of high-profile scandals have proved that regulations governing online casinos and bookmakers are inadequate, leading to “gross excesses, abuse and vulnerable problem-gamblers being let down”.Watson, who has already proposed a series of measures cracking down on the wider gambling industry, will describe the Gambling Act 2005, passed under Tony Blair’s government, as “unfit for the digital age”.“Whereas gambling in the offline world is highly regulated, the lack of controls on online gambling is leading to vulnerable consumers suffering huge losses,” he will say.“Online gambling companies have a responsibility to protect their customers from placing bets that they cannot afford.”The most eye-catching proposal would involve capping the amount that people can bet online and the speed at which they can do so.Watson, who is the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, will highlight the government’s recent move to slash the maximum allowable stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2.He will question why such strict limits are not in place for stakes placed online, despite recent research claiming that smartphone gambling apps are more dangerous than FOBTs.Watson will also call for online casinos to perform affordability checks, analysing whether customers have enough money to make high-stakes wagers.The Remote Gambling Association, which represents online gambling firms, said it supported “moves towards affordability and targeted intervention”. However, it warned against “arbitrary limits that risk driving customers to the unregulated and illegal gambling market”.Watson has already had some success with policies announced last year following a party review that called for a “whistle-to-whistle” ban on gambling ads during live sports broadcasts, and an end to the use of credit cards to place bets.The industry has since volunteered to stop advertising during sport, while the government has asked the industry regulator to review whether gambling on credit should be banned.Calls for a radical rethink of gambling laws follow a series of cases that fuelled concern about the behaviour of online casinos and bookmakers.They include Ladbrokes agreeing to pay £1m to the victims of a problem gambler who had stolen money to bet, on condition that they did not tell the Gambling Commission, the industry regulator.The commission said: “The online gambling sector is tightly regulated and we continue to review and develop our regulations with new technology and innovation in mind.“This is a stringent regime which has allowed us to take action against operators who don’t offer the best possible safety and protection for consumers. One example is our ongoing robust regulatory action against the online casino sector which has so far resulted in £14m in penalties.”The level of financial penalties issued by the commission, including those relating to offline bets, has risen steadily from £5.2m in 2016 to £10.8m the following year and £28m in 2018.Labour said it would launch a consultation about the relationship between video games and gambling, particularly betting-style features such as “skins” and “loot boxes”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a0fcd7a10d0ca5e1ed6a6fafa4ceb8a1af465af/0_91_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21f943ddcb247b4bb1f00974104e9909","title":"majority of children in gangs going under the radar study","story":"Safeguarding authorities ill-informed about numbers in gangs or at risk of recruitmentAn estimated 34,000 children linked to gangs have been victims of violent crime in the last year, yet only a small fraction of them are known to the authorities who are meant to be protecting them, according to a study.A report by the children’s commissioner for England paints a “deeply concerning” picture, with safeguarding authorities ill-informed about gang violence in their area and the number of children either in gangs or at risk of recruitment.Amid mounting concern about the number of fatal stabbings of teenagers, the commissioner, Anne Longfield, accused safeguarding authorities of not facing up to the scale of the problem and of failing in their duty to keep children from harm.The report, Keeping Kids Safe: improving safeguarding responses to gang violence and criminal exploitation, says 27,000 children in England identify as a gang member, and many more are on the periphery of gang membership.Yet only 6,560 are known to children’s services or youth offending teams, meaning the vast majority remain under the radar, at the mercy of gangs that use “chilling levels of violence” to keep them compliant.“I have been shocked to discover that many of those responsible for the protection of children in their local areas seem to have no idea where to start, despite hundreds of thousands of children being at risk,” said Longfield.On Wednesday a police official described the recent spate of knife crime across the country as a “national emergency”. Speaking after three teenagers died in knife attacks in two weeks in Birmingham, David Jamieson, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, called for additional funding to combat the problem.For the report, researchers asked 25 safeguarding boards in high-risk areas what they knew about the number of children either involved or at risk of becoming involved with gangs.“The response was deeply concerning,” Longfield said. “Not one of them was able to give adequate answers to all of our questions, while several areas with the highest indicators of gang violence had no estimate at all of levels of gang violence.”Longfield pointed to parallels with child sexual exploitation a decade ago, before children were recognised as victims, when authorities turned a blind eye to widescale abuse.“Many local areas are not facing up to the scale of the problem, they are not taking notice of the risk factors in front of them and they are not listening to parents and communities who ask for help,” she said.“The government and local areas need to face up to the scale of this challenge and ensure the priority and resources are allocated to helping these children, because it is clear to me that we are not doing enough to protect them from harm.”The research looked at the characteristics of children at risk of becoming involved in gangs. Compared with other children known to social services or other child offenders, they were more likely to have social, emotional and mental health issues, to be self-harming, to have a parent misusing substances or to be misusing themselves, to have witnessed domestic violence and to be out of school.The report calls on the government to make child criminal exploitation a national priority and to lay out clear expectations about the role of the police, schools, children’s services and NHS bodies.A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to protecting vulnerable children by cracking down on the ruthless gangs … That is why we launched the serious violence strategy, which puts a greater focus on early intervention alongside a tough law enforcement response.“We have proposed a new statutory duty on partners across education, social services and health to work together to tackle violence as part of a public health approach, and are providing £220m to support children and young people at risk of becoming involved in violence and gangs.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/972d58fbd7b52d73cbabd93ed855b8f76f4cc4d4/114_159_4770_2862/master/4770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad7d5f2341945b8862f97e20e4fccf98","title":"manu tuilagi decide racing offer six nations england france move","story":"• ‘I have to make the right decision for me and my family’ • France move would make centre ineligible for EnglandManu Tuilagi said his reported move to Paris to join Racing 92 is not yet a done deal and his future will not be finalised until the Six Nations is over. The centre remains torn between staying at Leicester or opting for a fresh start in France and described it as “the toughest decision” of his career.Should Tuilagi agree lucrative terms to join Racing he would be ineligible to represent England beyond this autumn’s World Cup, having only recently reclaimed his international starting place after a string of injuries. “It will be the toughest decision I’ve had to make,” he said, speaking in Oxford, where England are in camp. “It’s a massive decision and I have to make the right one for me and my family. There is a lot on the line for everyone.”Reports last week suggested Tuilagi , 27, was bound for Paris but even in defeat last Saturday’s Test against Wales in Cardiff was a reminder of how much he relishes playing for England.“It’s a lot to consider. I’m back with England and I loved playing at Cardiff, even though we lost. I love playing at the Tigers too. I need to take some time after this campaign, put everything on the table and make the right decision.”So far Eddie Jones, the England coach, has made no concerted attempt to influence Tuilagi’s decision, other than to make jokes about the player eating baguettes and croissants.“We’ve not really spoken about it … there’s nothing to be spoken about because I haven’t made a decision,” said Tuilagi, insisting reports he had already signed were premature.This week’s retirement of Mathew Tait, his Leicester clubmate who also suffered a catalogue of injuries, however, has reinforced just how precarious top-level rugby careers can be.One potential compromise might be to go to France for two seasons and then, in a perfect world, return for one last tilt at a World Cup before the next tournament in France in 2023.Chris Ashton and James Haskell have already proved it is possible for England players to have their gâteau and eat it, and Racing’s offer exceeds anything Leicester can afford.England will on Thursday crank up their preparations for the game against Italy at Twickenham on 9 March with a full-on training session against Georgia, whose coach, Milton Haig, says his players will be up for the challenge.“This is a big occasion for our guys,” Haig said. “We will all suit up and there will be some contact, not stupid stuff, but it will be refereed properly and we can challenge for the ball.”Last year Georgia caused England’s forwards significant scrummaging problems in a session in London and Haig reckons that will not have been forgotten.“There is a bit of edge this year and you can understand why. When two sides have a mindset that they don’t want to give an inch or millimetre, you usually get a bit of tension.”England are hopeful the lock Maro Itoje (knee) and wing Jonny May (concussion) will be fit enough to be considered against Italy. Jones’s side can still win the title should Wales slip up over the final two games and the defence coach, John Mitchell, believes the Cardiff result may yet prove a blessing in disguise.“Wales have done us a huge favour in many ways, because they have made us acutely aware of what we must fix,” he said.“We need to do that as quickly as possible. There’s not a lot you really need to tweak because we have a particular way we believe in but, clearly, our strategy will improve because of the Cardiff game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509556cbc242c009d900e99c486745a321d2b124/1578_497_5782_3468/master/5782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=532689c1a8bb624809474becb525a4c7","title":"richard alston dancers choreographer","story":"The newly knighted choreographer is shutting his company due to cuts and has snapped his achilles tendon. But he’s full of optimism about the futureI’m expecting Richard Alston to be angry, dejected, or at least a little perturbed. The 70-year-old choreographer recently announced he would be closing his company next year, not out of choice, but because of Arts Council England funding cuts. The company had just celebrated its 25th anniversary, and 50 years of Alston being a choreographer, the quality of work as fine as ever. Alastair Macaulay, former chief dance critic of the New York Times, called it “unequivocally the grimmest news for British dance this century”. It seemed utterly sad, at this stage in Alston’s life and career, for him to have the rug pulled from under his feet.But Alston is not angry. In fact, there was an element of hara-kiri: Alston was part of the decision. His company’s funding is tied to that of the Place, the dance organisation where he is based, and the ACE stipulated that the money allocated to Alston from the pot should be more than halved, effectively killing the company. “I knew that if I didn’t agree to do this, there was a threat that the Place would not get its funding,” he says. “The issue is that, technically speaking, the Arts Council has no method to fund an older artist.”We meet in an office next to Alston’s dance studio, surrounded by years of VHS tapes of performances waiting to be digitised. He is tall, generously bearded and elegant, although a little less so thanks to the medical boot he’s wearing, having snapped his achilles tendon. It’ll take six weeks to heal, he explains, “so I will definitely be wearing this to Buckingham Palace.”Ah yes, Buckingham Palace. Around the same time that his funding was cut, Alston was awarded a knighthood – talk about mixed messages. “That really warmed my heart,” he says. “It’s incredibly supportive.” He and Matthew Bourne are the only contemporary choreographers to have been knighted. “I got this letter in my rather scruffy hallway. When I opened it I just screamed.”Alston is also regularly stopped at the theatre for selfies by teenagers who are studying his work. He is an enormously important part of British dance, one of the country’s first homegrown contemporary choreographers. His instinctive musicality (whether using Scarlatti, Brahms or Terry Riley) makes his work easy to watch, but it is also full of rigour, detail and nuance, a sense of line and classical proportion and a lilting, curving grace.He spent his early years in Paris, where his father worked for the British Council. “We used to go to the Cirque Medrano. I wasn’t interested in the acrobatics per se, but I loved seeing these people moving.” He went to Eton, where the school’s record collection provided his musical education and he excelled in ballroom dancing classes.Alston dropped out at 16, around the same time his brother bought him tickets to see the Bolshoi Ballet at the Royal Festival Hall in London. “I found it pretty bizarre but I was fascinated.” Mikhail Fokine’s Chopiniana pas de deux “made my heart beat faster” and he was hooked. At Croydon ’’School of Art, he would miss evening lectures to take the train to Covent Garden for cheap seats at the Royal Ballet. “We all knew each other,” he says. “I see people now, distinguished elderly gentlemen, ‘Oh, remember when we were in the gods together!’” The dance obsession became all-consuming. “I decided, this is what I want to do, put my pencil down and put on some tights and get moving.”This gangly young man took some classes with Ballet Rambert, and soon after, New York’s Martha Graham Company came to London and Alston saw a note in the programme saying dancer Robert Cohan would be staying behind after the tour to teach. Alston went along, and the members of the class became the first performers in London Contemporary Dance Theatre. Six months later, when they needed new choreography, Alston made some. “I am absolutely the arch example of being in the right place at the right time,” he says. The company’s co-founder, Robin Howard, took a shine to him. “We came from the same sort of background. We both got out of public school and wanted to do something very different.”Alston went on to co-found Strider, Britain’s first independent dance company, and spent two “absolutely wonderful” years in New York in the late 70s studying with Merce Cunningham. For six years, he was artistic director at Ballet Rambert (promptly changing its name to Rambert Dance Company). He was politely sacked from Rambert in 1992, when he was 44. “So there was a very clear sense that there was going to be something new. Whereas at 70, a lot of people think I’ve chosen to retire and that’s that. I haven’t!” He wants to continue making work. “My only nervousness is that I have put myself about so little,” he says, referring to the necessary freelance hustle. “I have never written to companies saying I’m the most marvellous choreographer. I’ve been allowed to get on with being in the back room. But if I stay there I could just disappear.”“I’m not really into deep concepts and things,” he says. “I have a tremendous love of skill. My involvement with youth dance shows me that young people love it too … jumping, turning. It’s only when they go on a degree course that they think, oh, I can’t do that any more, I’m supposed to do something more thoughtful.”Do Alston’s interests, in fluent dancing, skill, speed, craft and music make him unfashionable? “Yes, probably,” he says. “I have no worries about that. I think the things I believe passionately in are timeless.”In a cruel stroke of ageing for a man whose life’s work is so intimately tied to music, Alston is losing his hearing. “The upper register is very bad,” he says. “It’s profound.” That must be very difficult, I say. “Yes, but thank God I’ve listened to so much music. Sometimes I don’t know whether I’m hearing music or remembering music.” He’s fine working with small groups in the studio, less so in bigger spaces. “When I go to theatres and parties I just practise my most warm, warm smile.” And it means he doesn’t go to concerts any more. Instead, he goes to galleries and reads copiously. “It’s quite hard to see the furniture in my flat because there are books all over the place.” He lives near Hampstead Heath, north London – alone because “I’m an absolute workaholic – I’m like a sort of monk. All those years ago at art college there was a rather impatient fellow student who once said to me, Richard, you’re like a helium-filled balloon tied to the Earth by a tiny string called dance.”Alston has no intention of cutting that string, hoping that there are companies – and no doubt there will be – “who’d be interested in taking a risk in letting an elderly deaf man loose on their dancers.”“I’m confident of my own resilience,” he says. “Whatever it is I’m going to find to do, I will find a way of enjoying it.” He knows it’s been a privilege to pursue his passions for so long. “I’m a very lucky, and a very happy man,” he says. “Whatever happens they can’t take that away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177c01790fe7e3e1a4fc04022aeea4cc0cc3b892/27_0_1788_1073/master/1788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89c871652a571297e0aa46849b1957d","title":"what is britbox streaming bbc itv questions answered","story":"How will the UK streaming joint venture affect your access to BBC and ITV programmes?What is BritBox?BritBox is a paid-for video streaming service founded as a joint venture by the BBC and ITV. It is expected to launch by the end of this year, subject to regulatory approval, with ITV encouraging other public service broadcasters such as Channel 4 and Channel 5 to also join and share their programming. A different version already exists in North America.How much will BritBox cost?There has been no announcement on cost, although the BBC and ITV say it will be “competitively priced”. Services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Sky’s Now TV are priced at around £6-8month. Given BritBox is being pitched as a supplementary subscription for households that already subscribe to a rival streaming service, it would be difficult to charge any more than these services.What shows will be available on BritBox?No announcements have been made but the focus will be on archive material that has previously been shown by BBC and ITV, so expect classic drama boxsets and popular sitcoms. BritBox will also commission some original programming but the service’s tiny budget compared with Netflix means there will only be a handful of standalone shows.Will all future BBC and ITV content appear on BritBox?New programmes broadcast by the BBC and ITV will continue to appear for free on the BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub catch-up services for a limited time. After this point you can expect many of them to then appear on BritBox and go behind a paywall.Both broadcasters will honour their existing deals with streaming services to show archive shows, such as ITV’s deal with Netflix to show vintage Love Island. However, expect the broadcasters to move as much of their back catalogue as possible across to BritBox in an attempt to drive subscriptions.Isn’t this all a bit late, given Netflix’s dominance of the market?Twelve years ago the UK’s big public service broadcasters came together to plan a one-stop streaming service called Project Kangaroo, which would bring together all the major channels under one paid streaming service. The pioneering proposal could have revolutionised the British TV industry. Instead it was blocked by the Competition Commission, a decision which now looks horribly misguided and gave Netflix a free run at the UK market. This is the BBC and ITV playing catch-up in the face of falling viewing figures for traditional TV.Why am I having to pay twice to watch BBC content?A decade ago UK viewers would pay the BBC licence fee and then – if they really liked a show – buy the DVD from a high-street shop, essentially paying twice for the same content. With DVD sales in decline, BritBox is replicating the second part of this transaction. However, a generation of viewers who have grown up with streaming services may find it confusing that they have to pay £12.90 a month for the BBC licence fee and then an extra sum to watch the same BBC programmes after an arbitrary cut-off date."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a434a5f369f9b854369a5f1ae83745a57efafd6/0_105_2226_1335/master/2226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ec3455ae7ba33b9b9c0f9f60187ec9b","title":"marie kondo declutter mind time psychology","story":"Along with owning too much stuff, we also pile unreasonable demands on our time. It’s time to limit our focuses“We have taken our wants and been told they are needs,” Joseph Ferrari, the lead author in the DePaul study, recently told the New York Times.This, he says, is why so many of us end up with loads and loads of stuff that doesn’t add value to our lives, the accumulation of which weighs us down and stresses us out.Though the above research, and pop-culture hits like the Netflix show Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, examine physical clutter, I’ve got a strong hunch that psychological clutter may be even worse for your health and performance. The more you’ve got going on at any given time, the less energy and attention you’ll have available for each activity. This is problematic because deep engagement is a precursor to fulfillment and enjoyment – a Harvard study found that people are much happier when they are fully present for the activity that they are doing. A rushed or scattered mind is generally not a happy mind.Busyness may have become a modern badge of honor, but that doesn’t mean it’s good for us. “There’s a global epidemic of overscheduling and it’s ruining our health,” writes Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson in the Johns Hopkins Health Review, citing evidence that when you feel trapped by an unreasonable number of obligations, it’s a quick road to anxiety and hollowness.Better than being chronically busy is to have a limited number of things that you care about and bring your all to them. A wonderful case study is the runner Eliud Kipchoge. As the best marathoner of all time, Kipchoge has countless opportunities to make media appearances and live the life of a celebrity. Yet he prefers a modest lifestyle with a singular focus on running. This, he’s said, makes him happy. “In life, the idea is to be happy,” Kipchoge says in the documentary Breaking2. “So I believe in calm, simple, low-profile life. You live simple, you train hard, and live an honest life. Then you are free.”Decluttering your life doesn’t just improve happiness it improves performance, too. One of the most popular sections in my book Peak Performance is on the notion of being a minimalist to be a maximalist. Nearly all the top performers that my co-author, Steve Magness, and I interviewed for the book were highly selective about how they spent their time and energy. It’s not that they were overly rigid and had no fun. It’s that they only worked on the things that really mattered to them, and they had the confidence to turn down all the things that didn’t – think of it as the Marie Kondo approach applied to your time. “If you want to be really good, if you want to master and thoroughly enjoy one thing, you’ve got to say no to many others,” Michael Joyner, a top researcher at the Mayo Clinic, told us for the book.Decluttering your life may be effective, but that doesn’t make it easy, especially in a world characterized by hyperconnectivity and endless opportunities to do more. The decluttering challenge is universal. Nearly everyone I coach struggles with it. The good news is that a three-step process can help.I go through this process with my coaching clients at least once a year and whenever they are feeling overwhelmed. What’s great is that this same process can be used on more microlevels, too. You could very easily adapt it in the context of your exercise routine or relationships.Remember: more may be more. But that doesn’t mean more is better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50e877aabaef46bfd2e4aa39a88038c9bea230a/0_114_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e9696ab82dd0320d0d86550aee5451c","title":"venezuela bridge simon bolivar colombia maduro","story":"Venezuelan authorities have blockaded a second bridge to Colombia amid fresh skirmishes between protesters and security forces loyal to embattled leader Nicolás Maduro.The move came as opposition leader Juan Guaidó travelled to Brazil to shore up international pressure on Maduro following an inconclusive meeting of regional leaders in Colombia earlier this week.Early on Wednesday, two shipping containers were positioned across the Simón Bolívar bridge, a major pedestrian crossing between the two countries, following days of sporadic violence.The bridge was the focus of a failed weekend attempt to bring US food aid into the country as part of opposition leader Juan Guaidó’s campaign campaign to force Maduro from power.Dozens were injured on Saturday as anti-government protestors clashed with Venezuela’s national guard and pro-Maduro gangs at the bridge and another crossing near near the Colombian city Cúcuta. In circumstances that remain unclear, at least two trucks carrying the aid caught fire during the violence.Footage broadcast on Colombian television on Wednesday showed a burned-out truck bed in front of the shipping containers, which had been positioned overnight across the Simón Bolívar bridge.Last month, Venezuelan authorities barricaded the nearby Tienditas bridge with two containers and an oil truck. That bridge was finished in 2016 but never inaugurated.The Colombian border has been closed to most vehicles since 2015 following a string of disputes between the two countries, and on Saturday Maduro closed all Venezuela’s borders.Colombia closed four crossings from its side on Saturday evening, reopening them on Monday afternoon.Saturday’s aid effort was intended to weaken Maduro by triggering a flood of military defections. That did not happen, but Colombian migration authorities reported that around 250 military officials have crossed the border, joining a steady stream of Venezuelan refugees leaving the country via unpoliced routes.After Saturday’s violence, Guaidó – who has been recognized as Venezuela’s rightful president by the US and fifty other countries – travelled to Bogotá and met with the US vice-president Mike Pence and Latin American leaders.Guaidó, who was officially barred from travel, was set to arrive in Brazil late on Wednesday for a meeting with the far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, an outspoken opponent of Maduro.Maduro’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, will travel to Moscow for talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday. Russia has been among Maduro’s staunchest allies during the crisis.Meanwhile, unrest continued near Venezuela’s eastern border with Brazil after violence that left at least three people dead and dozens injured over the weekend.On Tuesday morning, soldiers took control of an airport in the town of Santa Elena de Uairén, which was the focus of clashes between Venezuelan soldiers and indigenous protesters.Witnesses say they were attempting to travel to Maurak, where members of the Pémon indigenous community had captured 30 soldiers on Saturday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3808932.1551305205!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord once again broadband proves it s a political hot potato","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo did his best to distance the rising cost of the national broadband project from that of the National Children’s Hospital. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIn a seamless and friction-free slide from one shambles to another, Brexit gave way to Broadband for a brief midday wander along Due Diligence Drive.It made a nice change from all the talk about Robert, even if Bob’s yer uncle when it comes to guilt-free windbagging in the Dáil. Broadband, however, is not such an easy topic.(We were joking last week when we called the Brexit Omnibus Bill “Bob”. Then the Taoiseach began peppering his speech on Wednesday with references to “Bob” this and “Bob” that. Strange, as the acronym didn’t appear in his script, probably because it sounds decidedly odd when spoken aloud.)While the Opposition may carp about the Bill’s late arrival and question the Government’s ability to adequately cope with the Brexit challenge, Leo Varadkar can justifiably claim this shambles is The Other Crowd’s mess.But broadband? That’s a red-hot potato of a differently dangerous kind.When Micheál Martin brought it up during Leaders’ Questions, Leo lowered the visor on his helmet, pulled on a pair of asbestos gloves, grabbed a ten-foot bargepole and gingerly approached the issue.The Fianna Fáil leader gave him a potted history of the various promises on broadband from Fine Gael governments since 2012.There were Pat Rabbitte’s “humble expectations” of delivering high-speed broadband to every home and business in the country for the knockdown cost of around €350m. And then Alex White, another Labour communications minister, announcing a new strategy in 2016 which would bring 85 per cent coverage delivered by 2019 and 100 per cent by next year. All for an estimated €500m.One didn’t happen, the other won’t and the estimated cost is for the birds.‘A bit of a mess’“As we know, the tendering process has been very, very difficult – a bit of a nightmare,” said Micheál, putting it mildly, before mentioning last year’s debacle which ended with the resignation of then minister, Denis Naughten.“A bit of a mess around October”, as he put it.Now we have Richard Bruton in the hot seat, who has been saying for months that he will have a recommendation before cabinet on the last remaining tender in the new few weeks. But it’s nearly March and still no sign.“It’s been a tortuously slow process – numerous promises made and not fulfilled,” observed the Fianna Fáil leader, wondering when a decision will be made. And if the tender is accepted, would the Taoiseach have any idea what it might cost? At all at all?Visions of the ever-expanding bill for the national children’s hospital flooded Government minds.Leo, in bomb-disposal mode, stressed that things “have changed a lot in recent years” since that first estimate for broadband was optimistically suggested.Extending an asbestos-covered finger, he gave the National Broadband Programme a cautious prod and said something about costs being driven up. “As things stand” no bidder has been selected “as due diligence is still underway”.And just to be very clear, while no tender has been received it will be “many multiples of what the original estimate was”. But, and just to be very, very, very, clear, this is “VERY DIFFERENT TO THE CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL”.Oh, yes. He won’t be getting caught out like that again.Whenever the decision, vowed Leo, “it is a decision we want to be very transparent about”.Wait and see how Brexit pans outAnd anyway, he says that due diligence is still being done and there’s the cost-benefit analysis to consider, and don’t forget “the consultants who examined it for deliverability” and then the Government “of course” still has to do some work, as does the Department of Public Expenditure and, oh, have we mentioned the “international review panel involved” making sure the whole kit and caboodle makes sense?The Taoiseach, doing fantastic work at this stage with the bargepole, wanted people to understand that because achieving the broadband rollout “is going to be much more expensive than we had anticipated, we have to see how the public finances can bear it”.Remember, he cautioned, we have to see how “the events of the next couple of weeks” pan out, Brexit-wise.After that earful, Micheál Martin reckoned things weren’t looking too healthy on the broadband front.“Is there now a significant question mark over whether this plan is going to be rolled out or not?” He doubted if the Government was ever going to make a decision. However, in the unlikely event of the cabinet actually accepting the poisoned broadband chalice, was it too much to “expect some precision around the actual potentials costs?”Leo is not going to be rushed. Just because his Government is in charge of running the country doesn’t mean it will be saddled with making a decision on broadband. At least not until the blame is well and truly spread around.Trying to be helpful, he told Micheál it is his “objective” to be “in a position” to make a decision before Easter. “That’s the plan.”But. But. “Due Diligence is still underway” and, at the risk of repeating himself, the increased costs will have an impact on the public finances. Brexit notwithstanding, this won’t hit this year but there would be “significant impact” from next year and onwards.The Taoiseach, now expertly directing his ten-foot bargepole like a sgt major’s swagger stick, explained how the cost of the broadband rollout will be spread over the next 30 years.“So I don’t think it should just be a decision for this government alone, because the impact will fall on future governments too,” he said, deftly flicking away potential controversy.“Again, quite different to other projects that are in the news at the moment.” Quite. Move away, folks, no children’s hospital to see here.“And that’s why we want to be transparent on it and we also want to consult with the Oireachtas on it.” So the rest won’t be shouting blue murder whenever the time comes to call in the management consultants for an expensive report in advance of the resignations and public inquiry.You can’t say you weren’t warned."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3808835.1551299657!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"oireachtas must decide on pac s powers after kerins ruling","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe committee hearing in 2015 examined costs, salaries and allowances of voluntary organisations that were in receipt of State funding and Angela Kerins was questioned at length about her salary arrangements at Rehab. File photograph: Collins CourtsThe Houses of the Oireachtas will be forced to make a major decision in April to either curb the powers of the public accounts committee (PAC) or greatly expand its remit in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in the case taken by Angela Kerins. Senior political sources in Leinster House said no decision would be taken on the future powers of the PAC until the final part of the Supreme Court judgment was delivered in April. It will also wait until the court’s judgment in a separate case, against the Oireachtas and its Committee on Procedure and Privileges by businessman Denis O’Brien, in relation to the disclosure in the Dáil by Catherine Murphy of details relating to the sale of Siteserv to a company associated with him. However, one source, a whip of a party, said a showdown was now inevitable as the PAC had been found to be in breach of standing orders, and also was the subject of complaints by other Oireachtas committees for incursions into their territory. ImplicationsThe Supreme Court yesterday ruled the PAC acted “significantly outside its remit” in its questioning of former Rehab chief executive Angela Kerins.Timmy Dooley, the Fianna Fáil member of the commission, said it would now have to take a very serious look at the judgment and its implications. “It raises a flag in how committees exercise their functions. Over time we will have to address that,” he said. He continued: “In light of the judgment, various different members of all committees will have to take stock of that.”SalaryThe PAC hearing in 2015 examined costs, salaries and allowances of voluntary organisations that were in receipt of State funding and Ms Kerins was questioned at length about her salary arrangements at Rehab. On Wednesday, the court held it would not be a breach of the separation of powers for it to declare the actions of the PAC unlawful in light of the fact that the PAC was acting outside its terms of reference and that a relevant committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, namely the the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, had come to that view.The court has invited further submissions on whether or not there was a “substantial breach of its obligations” and has reserved judgment on that matter until April. ‘Lengthy judgment’Fianna Fáíl TD John McGuinness was chairman of the PAC at the time. When contacted on Wednesday, he said he could not comment as he had not had an opportunity to read what was a “lengthy judgment” or receive a briefing from Oireachtas lawyers. Mr Dooley, when asked by reporters had the PAC been involved in ambulance chasing, rejected the portrayal. The former Fine Gael TD Áine Collins, a member of the PAC in 2014, said: “The Supreme Court judgment is actually the right decision. What happened in 2014 was incorrect.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3808904.1551303386!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk eu rift on backstop widens as britain seeks changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish and EU sources say the text of the Withdrawal Agreement provisions on the backstop cannot be changed. An anti-Brexit rally in Co Louth, January 2019. File photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireSignificant gaps remain between European Union and UK negotiators on the changes sought by the British on the backstop, according to sources briefed on the discussions.Senior Irish Government sources say they now accept that some sort of standalone document may be agreed to include EU clarifications on the backstop and guarantees that the UK will not be held in a customs union indefinitely.But Dublin is resisting the British description of the document as a “codicil” which implies a change to the legal nature of the backstop – the guarantee there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.Some sources say the British are using the term “codicil” in a bid to bolster the impact of any EU guarantees and assurances. But Dublin says that any new document cannot change the legal status of the Withdrawal Agreement.Nonetheless, Irish and EU sources say the British position has moved and is now much more “realistic”, by which they mean the British requirement that time-limit and a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop be written into the treaty has been dropped.However, they warn that there is still a significant distance between the two sides, and any breakthrough is not expected until much closer to a series of votes in the House of Commons in mid-March.Brussels says that contacts are continuing “at a technical level” between the British and European Commission teams, led by Olly Robbins on the British side and Sabine Weyand for the EU.The British Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was in Brussels earlier this week and British reports stressed progress on changing the backstop, though EU sources played down talk of any significant breakthroughs.Irish and EU sources remain firm that the text of the Withdrawal Agreement provisions on the backstop cannot be changed, but say that a document containing EU guarantees about the backstop and the future relationship could be part of the package. An intensive period of negotiations is expected over the coming weeks.Some sources say that if there is to be an agreement on the changes required by the British, it is likely to come shortly before the votes in the House of Commons expected on March 12th to 14th.A draft agreement between the British government and the European Commission could then be voted on by MPs and, if passed, could be ratified by EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Match 21st to 22nd. That would leave a week for the European Parliament to ratify the deal before the Brexit date of March 29th.However, given the stop-start nature of Brexit so far, not many sources express confidence that events will proceed according to this timetable, and an extension of article 50 is still widely expected.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Ho PruAFPGetty (Few at Westminster were expecting MPs to vote on Yvette Cooper’s amendment confirming Theresa May’s commitment to give them a vote on delaying Brexit if they rejected the withdrawal agreement. The government said the amendment was unnecessary but agreed to join opposition parties in supporting it on the basis that it echoed the prime minister’s own policy.But when the Speaker put the amendment to a voice vote, the No’s were just too loud to ignore and he called a ision. The result was illuminating, with 20 Conservative Brexiteers voting against the amendment and more than 80 more abstaining, along with all but one of the DUP’s 10 MPs.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers, set pulses racing on Wednesday morning when he said he could vote for the prime minister’s deal even if the Northern Ireland backstop was not replaced.He told the BBC that the changes he sought to the backstop could be written into an appendix so that the text of the agreement itself would not have to be reopened.“Bear in mind, the Irish backstop is in itself an appendix to the treaty. So if you had a further appendix that said, ‘This will not go beyond a particular date’, and a short date, not a long date, then that would remove the backstop in the lifetime of parliament,” he said.“A changed deal is a changed deal. Of course, I would be open to considering that.”The EU is unlikely to offer an appendix that specifies an end date for the backstop but negotiators are working on further assurances that Britain will not be trapped within it indefinitely.Senior figures in the ERG acknowledge privately that if the changes to the backstop satisfy the DUP, all but a handful of the Conservative Brexiteers will support May’s deal.The 20 who voted against Cooper’s amendment could be most of the hard core that will oppose the deal regardless, a number that could be offset by Labour MPs who represent constituencies that voted heavily to leave the EU in 2016. Labour’s move to support a second referendum and fears that the EU will insist that an article 50 extension must be lengthy should concentrate Brexiteer minds ahead of next month’s meaningful vote.The DUP’s 10 MPs are pivotal and their judgment will determine the fate of May’s deal and perhaps the future of Brexit itself. And they’re saying nothing.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

They are also driving vehicles into the machines in an effort to access the coins.The recurring crime has left the Council with little choice but to consider ending cash payments for the 700 parking meters across the borough, which charge from £1.30 to £4.90 per hour. They are now urging motorists to pay for parking through their app or phone system.Kensington and Chelsea Council\u0027s lead member for streets, planning and transport, Will Pascall said that the parking gangs’ profits are funding other crimes such as drugs and trafficking in the capital. He said: We have gangs stalking the streets and smashing their way into machines to suck the cash out.We also now know from local police that this is funding further criminality in London, from drugs and trafficking to possibly violent crime.Some of the damage caused by thievesIt is a trend we need to stop and motorists going cashless is one way we can help tackle this.It is understood that the Council have reported the incidents to the politan Police but no suspects have been caught because of the very little evidence that is left behind.A recent AA poll of 17,000 drivers found that 70 per cent of people are less likely to use a car park where only phone payments are accepted.The president of the AA Edmund King urged for caution over the proposed switch to cashless machines for the sake of elderly drivers, saying: It is a sad state of affairs when parking meters are being ambushed by criminals armed with sledgehammers and vacuum cleaners.Whilst there is merit in cashless systems and they are becoming more commonplace, we do still find that some older drivers prefer to pay in cash or with contactless cards.In November last year, Tameside Council in Manchester introduced 150 cashless bays which required motorists to call, text or download a smartphone app to pay for parking. Locals described the move as “discriminatory” to elderly residents who do not have mobile phones. Others criticised the damage it could do to local business, with one shop owner saying: People aren\u0027t going to pop in for a sandwich if they have to get out an app and register their car.”Jonny Combe, UK chief executive of parking payment firm PayByPhone, which is used by the council, encouraged the move away from cash payments. He said: Moving away from coins and relying on a mobile parking payment service is a great way for any council to reduce this type of theft and vandalism.Cashless parking also delivers convenience to drivers, as they can start a parking session in a matter of seconds and use their phones to extend the parking from anywhere - even from their smart watch.They don\u0027t have to worry about cutting appointments short to rush back to feed a meter.Trump-Kim summit: The latest updates from the Vietnam meetingGoing to nursery is now as expensive as going to university, analysis findsAlmost half of GPs plan to quit NHS within five years amid criticism of Skype consultations   England faces new grooming scandal as 27,000 children are lured into gangs, says Children\u0026#39s Commissioner Up to 4,000 crime victims win right to compensation as ministers lift ban on \u0026#34same roof\u0026#34 claims Sally Challen appeals charge arguing new law means she is not guilty of murdering husband Donald Trump is \u0026#39a racist, conman and cheat\u0026#39 former lawyer Michael Cohen claims to CongressThe Junk Food Experiment, review: these guinea pigs dropped like overfed fliesMichael Cohen attempts to torpedo Donald Trump\u0026#39s presidency in blistering testimony to CongressThe Satanic Verses: 30 Years On, review -

This one is from London, please send me yours,” wrote Mayor Virginio Merola on social media earlier this week.Pictures rolled in of Knorr “spaghetti Bolognese” sauce spice mix from Austria, a sad, plastic confection of overcooked pasta from Utrecht, a jar of Heinz sauce from Ocado in Britain and a black board offering “Bolonske Spagety” in Moravia.Mr Merola said Wednesday he plans to collect all the photos sent to him and create an exhibit for the city’s newly minted FICO Eataly World, the world’s largest food theme park.  Increasing numbers of tourists are flocking to Bologna to sample its gastronomy, Mr Merola said, but there’s one dish they won’t find.“It is strange to be famous all over the world for a dish that isn’t ours,” he told the .  “Of course we are happy that it draws attention to our city, but we would prefer to be known for the quality food that is part of our culinary tradition.”The two towers of BolognaThe succulent, meat-filled triangular tortellini for example, or even mortadella, a deli pork meat that has inspired knock off products known as “baloney” -  and often spelled “Bologna” - in the US.Under the leaning towers and pastel porticoes of the city known for good food, leftist politics and its ancient university, it is a colossal foodie faux pas to ask for Spaghetti Bolognese.Waiters grimace, look perplexed and repeatedly explain to tourists that the dish they are referring to is locally called Tagliatelle al Ragù, or Tagliatelle Bolognese,  a flat, handmade egg dough pasta covered in a slow-cooked meat sauce that also has bits of  celery, carrots, onions, tomato sauce, slowly simmered with wine.Spaghetti Bolognese has sparked heated online controversies as exasperated Italians try to defend the proper  Ragù alla Bolognese - with tomatoes and red wine as key ingredients.Viewers complained vociferously on social media in 2017 when Mary Berry, former Great British Bake Off star, made the Italian classic on her BBC Two show using garlic and adding thyme and cream.  Had she attended the Cheltenham Literature Festival in 2016, Ms Berry would have been forewarned that herbs were a no-no by Italian gastronomy expert Antonio Carluccio.   Not only are there no herbs nor garlic, it simply cannot just be slathered  on just any kind of pasta. Bolognese Ragù is one of the chunkier sauces, hence served with sturdier pastas like tagliatelle or tortellini, but, ironically, never spaghetti.  Trump-Kim summit: The latest updates from the Vietnam meetingGoing to nursery is now as expensive as going to university, analysis findsAlmost half of GPs plan to quit NHS within five years amid criticism of Skype consultations   England faces new grooming scandal as 27,000 children are lured into gangs, says Children\u0026#39s Commissioner Up to 4,000 crime victims win right to compensation as ministers lift ban on \u0026#34same roof\u0026#34 claims Sally Challen appeals charge arguing new law means she is not guilty of murdering husband Donald Trump is \u0026#39a racist, conman and cheat\u0026#39 former lawyer Michael Cohen claims to Congress -

Now they\u0027re branching out so a lot of their businesses have been very good.With little real-world testing, it is difficult to say whether the usefulness of foldable phones will lead to them replacing traditional smartphones on any significant scale. Should this prove to be the case, however, Apple may once again hope that being late to the game pays off.There are already signs that Apple may be developing a foldable gadget, with a patent for a Flexible display device published earlier this month.\u0026nbspRenders\u0026nbspcreated by Dutch designer Roy Gilsing\u0026nbsphave imagined\u0026nbspwhat a folding Apple phone might look like.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.Most of the jobs created in the UK since the financial crisis have been in low-paid, low-skilled sectors such as bars, social work and warehouses.As wages have stagnated, it has been cheaper and less risky to take on extra staff than investing money in machinery, training or research and development. It’s relatively easy to get rid of workers, less so to recoup millions spent on a new high-tech warehouse you no longer need.Some firms have dispensed even with the risk of hiring staff by claiming that those staff are merely self-employed workers connected to customers by a technology platform.Firms leaving the UK, downsizing or cutting jobs ahead of BrexitWorkers have done less well out of this situation. Poor wage growth and freezes to benefits have sent in-work poverty sharply upwards.The average real wage is still £500 below its pre-crisis peak and the number of children living in poverty is on track to reach a record high by 2023-4, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.Yes they are. In the year to December, average earnings rose at their fastest pace in a decade. Surely proof that the Brexit doommongers are wrong?Not really. While nominal wage growth is rising fast, this doesn’t take account of the rising cost of living.When we factor in inflation, wages rose by a relatively modest 1.2 per cent over the year which is some way below the long-run average and less than pace when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016.They are now beginning to rise not because the economy is faring particularly well but because the pool of cheap available labour is running out.\u0026nbspOne factor that may be affecting this is a reduction in net migration.There is no real evidence for that.As Tom Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics explains: “In theory, higher levels of net migration should increase the supply of labour, putting downward pressure on wages.\u0026nbsp“But more net migration also increases demand for goods and services which puts upward pressure on wages.”In reality, most studies agree that these two factors more or less offset each other.A sharp drop in the available workforce would be expected to boost wages, but only in the short term, says Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King’s College in London.“In the long-term you can’t pay yourself more than you earn.”Ultimately wages can only rise sustainably if workers are more productive - if they make more goods and services for each hour they work.Car industry workers want to leave the EUBut productivity in the UK is actually declining, according to the latest official figures. In part this is due to the fact that companies are holding off on investment because of Brexit uncertainty.This effect may subside if uncertainty comes to an end but the fact remains that outside the EU, Britain is a considerably less attractive prospect for many firms looking to invest.The decline in available labour could also lead to mismatches between skills available and job vacancies. We have already seen this situation in the NHS for example, which for a variety of reasons now has a very large number of vacancies.\u0026nbspSuch mismatches would also be expected to drag on productivity as people end up in roles they aren’t particularly good at or well-trained for.Meanwhile, some of the world’s most productive companies - Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Airbus - are at various stages of implementing plans to cut thousands of UK jobs. Brexit is not the only factor at play here but it is certainly a key one.Most of those companies have held off making such decisions for as long as possible. To move staff, offices and factories can be expensive. But with uncertainty dragging on, the point where those decisions become economically rational has now arrived for many firms and that certainly will not be good for British workers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Now it is in that situation\u0026nbspthere are others who also have claims upon its assets, claims that may take priority over those of the aggrieved customers.\u0026nbspWere this a savings company of some description that wouldn\u0027t be the case. There would be compensation available to anyone losing out through the savings industry funded Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\u0026nbspTrouble is it doesn’t cover lenders even though the FCA has been regulating them since 2014.\u0026nbspAndrew Bailey, the boss of the FCA, says consideration has been given to including them but “in the event of the failure of a lender… customers generally don’t suffer losses. Loan customers are more likely to owe money to the lend rather than the other way round”.\u0026nbspIn most cases that’s true, but not in this one because of the way Wonga was carrying on.\u0026nbspAs a result thousands of people look set to be left out of pocket, calling that decision into question.So what next?Bailey makes the point that it would be a bit rum if the savings companies that pay into the FSCS were now called upon to bail out the past misconduct of a lender.\u0026nbspWhile some of them also are lenders, that’s by no means true of all them and so you’d be robbing Peter to pay for\u0026nbspthe misdeeds of Paul.

Many of M\u0026ampS’s customers\u0026nbspthat want online grocery shopping\u0026nbspare already Ocado customers, he says.“It may have overestimated the lure of M\u0026ampS products, and indeed the questionable benefits of being able to order an M\u0026ampS dress with a weekly shop.”\u0026nbspThe new tie-up can be a success but only if M\u0026ampS sticks to the premium products it’s famous for like, says George Lawrie, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester.“In other words, it will work for champagne, fresh oysters, canapes and caviar, but not for things like cling film and carrots,” he says. This marries with Ocado’s vision of a premium delivery experience, with smartly dressed drivers delivering your groceries straight to your kitchen table.Luxury deliveries work better because of cost, Lawrie explains.“Normally you’d expect picking, packing and transporting produce to amount to around 25-30 per cent of the cost of a single item, a cost that high margin retailers can absorb but low margin grocery cannot – unless everything is highly automated.”M\u0026ampS clearly can’t compete with the big supermarkets when it comes to customers’ weekly shops, says Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds shares in M\u0026ampS.He is also pessimistic about the deal, describing the £600m M\u0026ampS is raising to pay for the new venture as an “extravagant use of shareholders’ money”.“The motivations behind this deal for M\u0026ampS are clear, as the company has long struggled with an online offering that is not up to scratch.”The benefits to M\u0026ampS of an online food shopping are not certain because of the limited range of products it stocks, says Mumford. Consumers see it as a place to top up their weekly food shop with premium items, rather than somewhere for a large weekly shop.But that’s not so much a problem as it might once have been because Ocado has become less dependent on Waitrose products and now stocks broad range of own-brand and private label products, says Stephen Lienert, senior analyst at Jefferies.“Ocado therefore goes full circle: whereas before people used Ocado to access Waitrose products, now the supermarkets want to use Ocado.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The idea is to give people back control of their data and end the exploitation and monetisation of people\u0027s private lives by the likes of Facebook and Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHTC describes its Exodus 1 as the first smartphone built for this new internet and it is the brainchild of Phil Chen, the appropriately-titled \u0027decentralized chief officer\u0027 of the Taiwanese firm.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re this far into the information age and there\u0027s barely any conversation about digital property, Chen tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspAll of our private data – from credit history to search data – is handled by third parties. We don\u0027t own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.The way to get the power back, Chen says, is to introduce a paradigm shift to the big data business models of these large tech companies, from the apps we use, to the way we pay.\u0026nbspThese blockchain phones operate on the same underlying technology that supports bitcoin, so it is no surprise that cryptocurrencies form a key role in their operation.At MWC, HTC is also introducing a new range of decentralised apps – or\u0026nbspdApps\u0026nbsp– that do not share or send data back to a centralised company or server. Some apps even allow people to monetise their own data, by selling it for cryptocurrency.Payments can also go the other way, meaning users can make micropayments directly to websites and content creators without the need for transaction fees.\u0026nbspEven the phone\u0027s default browser, Opera, supports\u0026nbspsuch functionality, describing itself as the world\u0027s first crypto-ready browser.We are at the dawn of a new generation of the Web, one where new decentralized services will challenge the status quo, says Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera.\u0026nbspHTC and Opera have both made the bold decision to be the first to step up and enable this transformation.ethereum (HTC)Like other blockchain phones, such as the Sirin\u0026nbspFinney, the HTC Exodus 1 comes with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet that can store private keys for\u0026nbspbitcoin, ether and litecoin\u0026nbspoffline. By not being connected to the internet, this cold-storage wallet protects the funds from hacking, as well as a person\u0027s private data.Until now, the HTC Exodus has only been available to buy in cryptocurrency\u0026nbspbut from March people will be able to purchase it using traditional fiat currency, with the eventual hope that the phone and the decentralised web will make it into the mainstream.I don\u0027t like calling it a blockchain phone because it\u0027s not just for crypto geeks, Chen says.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIt\u0027s been 10 years since the birth of bitcoin and blockchain technology but the industry is still very much in its infancy.Interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain has been in decline ever since bitcoin\u0027s dramatic price crash, which saw the cryptocurrency lose more than three quarters of its value in 2018.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Online analytics show Google searches for both terms have been in free-fall during that time, and according to Gartner, the technology entered the so-called \u0027trough of disillusionment\u0027 phase in its 2018\u0026nbspHype Cycle for Emerging Technologies\u0026nbspreport.The leading market research firm says it may be another 10 years before it reaches the \u0027plateau of productivity\u0027 and begins to see widespread adoption.For this to happen, Chen says, it will likely involve the very tech giants that this technology poses a threat to. Their considerable reach means their adoption of such technology would automatically push it into the mainstream. Another scenario would be that continued data breaches propel\u0026nbspthe conversation of digital property into the spotlight.People are becoming more aware of their data and will realise this is part of the solution, he says. This could spread like wildfire. The tech giants may try to quell its spread, but ultimately they may have to choose between fuelling it or getting burnt and left behind.The HTC Exodus 1 and Sirin\u0026nbspFinney\u0026nbspmay be the first, but blockchain technology is already seeping into more mainstream devices. Earlier this month, Samsung announced its flagship Galaxy S10 range of smartphones, which came with a Blockchain Keystore.There are also rumours that Facebook is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, which could facilitate payments across its range of messaging apps – from WhatsApp to Messenger. With close to 2 billion users worldwide, such a move could create a currency to rival the dominance of the\u0026nbspUS dollar almost overnight.In a recent interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg explained how blockchain-based authentication could make the social network more secure. But he added: I\u0026nbsphaven\u0027t figured out a way to make this work out.With the technological and financial resources at his disposal, it may just be that Zuckerberg simply hasn\u0027t figured out a way to implement the technology in a way that Facebook can still claim ownership\u0026nbspto it.blockcain smartphones (HTC)The open, decentralised and borderless nature of blockchain\u0026nbspis the reason blockchain remains the only technology vertical not dominated by the incumbents of the industry – it is antithetical to their current business model. The likes of Amazon and Google are leading the way in everything from fintech\u0026nbspto artificial intelligence, as these are all technologies they can control and own.The two largest smartphone makers, Samsung and Huawei, both profit from personal data through their cloud storage businesses. It could therefore fall to Apple to create that spark.Tim Cook keeps talking about privacy but can he take the next step? I\u0027m hopeful and I would be their first cheerleader if they did, Chen says.\u0026nbspThis is a big, giant leap, but we are a David among Goliaths.

But, as Jo Lamiri discovers, they are still buoyant – thanks to a charity giving them a platform for changeClick to followThe IndependentThe 10\u0026nbspor so fishermen I spoke to in Lyme Bay – that breathtakingly beautiful arc of unspoilt coastline between Portland Bill and Start Point that straddles Dorset and Devon – all told the same story. Fishing is in their blood, otherwise they wouldn’t do it. But they are, to a man, concerned about the future of fishing, choked like detritus in a net by the Brussels-imposed bureaucracy of the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs (Defra) and the looming uncertainty of Brexit.These are the guys who take their “under-10s”\u0026nbsp(boats less than 10 metres) out to fish for crab, lobster, bass, cod and skate (ray) from West Bay, Lyme Regis, Beer and Axmouth – just as their fathers and grandfathers did before them. Yet these small boats still have to comply with quotas set for the big trawlers that scoop up all marine life in their wake, leaving the seabed smooth and devoid of its natural ecosystems.UK fishermen will have to ‘show catches to EU under no-deal Brexit’Harbourmaster at Axmouth, Angus Walker says: “There are about 600 registered boats from big companies that get 96 per cent\u0026nbspof the quota, leaving 3,000 independents in England with 4 per cent\u0026nbsp– it’s ludicrous. In the Channel we have zero rating this month and last month for cod so we can’t catch any, yet there is loads in the sea. We’ve got to come up with a better system.”Of course, no one knows what will happen post-Brexit. But there are rumours that tariffs of up to 8 per cent\u0026nbspcould be imposed on lobster and crab environment secretary Michael Gove is asserting that no foreign boats will be allowed within six to 12 miles of the UK coast and that the UK will become an “independent coastal state”, taking control of its waters up to 200 miles.“We will take back control of our territorial waters, and for the first time in 50 years, we will be able to grant fishing access for other countries on our terms,” adds Defra. “We will allocate quotas on the basis of what is scientifically sustainable, making sure we have a healthy marine environment and profitable fishing industry.”The fishermen remain cynical over such political promises. Dave Sales – now in his 80s – is still lifting pots over the side of his small boat, Shelley Marie. A direct, no-nonsense man, he is a big fish in the industry (pardon the pun), dropping environment secretary Michael Gove into conversation and consulting with fishing committees around the country. “I started fishing crab and lobster in Lyme Bay in 1957, and I’ve been in West Bay 37 years. When it comes to quota, the problem is that the government doesn’t care two hoots about the small man, but we still have to abide by the rules and regulations.“There’s one word that describes the fishing industry and that’s ‘greed’. There are so many small boats fishing out of Lyme now that in a couple of years there won’t be any fish left. They’re all using miles and miles of net. I look back and think ‘thank goodness I’ve had my day’.”Angus agrees with Dave’s views on the government: “With a pen, in an office, the attitude of Defra has done more damage in the past decade than fishermen have done in the past 1000 years. They focus too much on single species. The guy from the MMO (Marine Management Organisation) regularly comes down here and has a coffee with us to talk about the issues we’re facing, but I can’t remember the last time I saw someone from Defra.”Many of the fisherman I spoke to felt quotas should be axed for small boats. West Bay fisherman Jamie Smith says: “There’s only so much you can do and the weather restricts us. The big boats threaten our livelihoods, as well as those of the boat builders, fuel suppliers and gear suppliers.” Matt takes a similar view. “They may say it’s done for conservation issues, but to me the biggest conservation issue is the weather. If we can’t go out, we can’t catch the fish. If you’re looking to conserve the fish, start with reserves and the right method of fishing.”There’s one word that describes the fishing industry and that’s ‘greed’Quotas aren’t the only bugbear. Each boat also has to have a licence, based on its catch history, which becomes progressively more expensive as they are capped. Matt explains: “Some boats are only allowed 300kg of fish under quota others can catch just shellfish, just fish or both. So if an uncapped licence comes up for sale it’s very expensive. Capping is also a way of taking out some of the boats that don’t catch a huge amount. To buy a small boat like mine with bass entitlement costs a fortune. The boat might be worth £10,000 but the licence can be £30,000.”Fortunately, help is at hand in the form of a charity, the Blue Marine Foundation (Blue). Set up in 2008 by some of the team behind the award-winning documentary The End of the Line including environmentalist Charles Clover, Blue creates large marine reserves worldwide to encourage sustainable fishing models and improve bioersity. Its aim is to protect 10 per cent\u0026nbspof the world’s oceans by 2020 and 30 per cent by 2030.The 206km sq Lyme Bay Fisheries and Conservation Reserve was established in 2008 after years of campaigning to stop trawling and dredging across certain types of ground. Persuading fishermen, conservationists, scientists and regulators to work collaboratively, Blue has proved there is a sweet spot between fishing and conservation where you can fish less but catch more with guaranteed quality.Created with Sketch.Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern Ireland Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Enda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, IrelandMorven Robertson of Blue explains how it all began. “We had a meeting in a cafe\u0026nbspin West Bay at which the fishermen almost chucked our UK Director Tim in the harbour. There had been years of trying to get this MPA (Marine Protected Area) created ...\u0026nbspWay before us, the Dorset Wildlife Trust had been campaigning because Lyme Bay has the UK’s largest population of pink sea fans, beautiful coral that supports lots of marine life, including juvenile scallops. Since the formation of the reserve, the population of pink sea fans has increased eight-fold.“The fishermen were worried about the way things were going and in 2008 the government agreed to create an MPA which pushed out all trawling and dredging. But then, other potters and netters started to fish in the reserve as they knew their nets wouldn’t get damaged or their pots towed away. It created a honey pot – the area was saturated.“So the fishermen came to Blue and said that although the area had been protected they weren’t seeing any benefit as there was too much potting and static gear – as a result, they were left fearing the imposition of a total ban on fishing and their livelihoods. We now have 32 boats and 59 fisherman signed up to our code of conduct, following sustainable fishing methods which conserve habitats and boost fish stocks. Other fishermen do work the bay, but if someone tries to put down too many pots they will tell them not to.”They’ve noticed the environmental benefits of the reserve, too. Axmouth fisherman Bob Carless says: “You can see the effects the reserve is having on the seabed. Before you get out to the six-mile limit, the seabed is full of life, undulating, natural. But as soon as you hit the six mile mark, you can see where the dredgers have left it totally flat.”The Marine Conservation Society compiles a national rating system that chefs and suppliers use as a go-to when finding out what’s sustainable and what they should be cooking and eating. But, as Morven explains, it’s completely unfair for small fleets like Lyme. “One of our fishermen sells to River Cottage and they are saying that John Dory is now a no-go as well, but ratings are based on available data often for other larger offshore fleets or boats using fishing methods we can’t use here. To obtain a rating that accurately reflects local stocks and low impact of the inshore fleet Blue is gathering data on these species with the fishermen to provide credible evidence on which to base a local rating.Just a few weeks ago the MSC, the global fisheries certification scheme announced that mackerel in the northeast Atlantic had been stripped of its blue tick. Now people are concerned we shouldn’t eat mackerel either, but what about all the guys who catch it here in the summer, with rod and line. Is that sustainable?”Forming the reserve has been hugely beneficial for the fishermen, in an industry where solidarity is vital, says Morven. “We provide them with a route to market for sustainable fish, which they sell at a premium, and regular meetings they often spend all day fishing alone, so it’s great to give them a voice.” Matt agrees: “We’re sitting down with the MMO, the Fisheries etc and they’re listening to us. That would never have happened before. Blue is giving us a mouthpiece.”Even before Blue came along, the fishermen have always seen themselves as s of the deep. Jamie says: “There’s no point in catching everything today or there will be nothing for tomorrow. Matt and I look at the sea as the bank. If you rob the bank, there’s nothing left.” Matt agrees: “It’s our culture and heritage – it’s not just about money – so we have to fight to protect it. We’re incredibly lucky to have the reserve, as it’s made it a much more viable proposition for the small boats to go out of here and earn a living.”For Jim Newton, fishing out of Beer, sustainability is a given. “It’s our livelihood so we don’t need to be told not to catch fish that are spawning. If cuttlefish eggs are found on our pots we have to leave them in the water – often for weeks – until they hatch, which of course affects our catch of lobster and crab.“For the past 20 years we’ve also been collecting tons of plastic from the sea as it can clog up our nets and pots ... Yet all that gets focused on is a tiny pile of fishing line. The number one plastic we find is those plastic beads used in packaging”.Morven explains that Blue has also helped define sustainability. “Our research showed that fishing with 250 pots is the sustainable level any more damages the reef and sees a decline in lobster and crab. They were fishing with many more pots and wondering why the lobster stocks were crashing. Now we’ve seen a 4.5-fold increase in lobster, which benefits everyone.”\u0026nbspCharlie Ziemann, a fisherman in Axmouth, says: “To me, sustainability means being able to go out again and again and again and catch the same amount of fish. We’re not taking more than is being produced.”On the back of the reserve’s success, Blue launched the Reserve Seafood brand in 2015, which now champions 29 species of premium, provenance-assured fish and seafood caught in Lyme Bay Reserve and sold to markets and restaurants across the UK. Fish in the reserve are caught by hand ing, static nets, pots or rod and line – mainly, lobster, crab, pollock and flat fish such as sole and plaice.Paul Shearing, executive chef at London’s Roast restaurant in Borough Market, is an ambassador for Reserve Seafood. He says, “For me it’s been a journey of discovery. I get my fish for the restaurant from all over the country ... These days, with fish farming, you can get on the phone and specify exactly what size you want. So I came down here fishing last summer with my nine-year-old son Alfie and got chatting to the fishermen.“Once you get out here you realise sustainability is subjective, it’s not just a buzzword. What the government says, and what you hear in London, isn’t necessarily true.“It’s a bloody hard story ... The guys can’t earn money at some times of the year, they’re out in all conditions. It made me realise how out of touch we chefs are to complain if a mackerel is 50g over the weight we’ve asked for.\u0026nbspYet fish is a natural product, migratory and seasonal, so of course every fish is a different size.He has seen, first hand, how unreliable quotas can be. “When I was out on the boat in Lyme with them they said ‘We reckon you could walk across the sea bass round here there’s so much of it’.”It’s a bloody hard story … The guys can’t earn money at some times of the year, they’re out in all conditionsTo showcase how wonderful this fish and seafood is, we gathered at the lovely Kingfisher pub in Colyton, run by fisherman Mark Dack and his wife, where Paul cooked up some fantastic seared scallops with black pudding, crab and apple, and pollock with beurre blanc: simple, quick, delicious food.Blue also gives practical help. “We built chiller units and installed ice machines, funded by the EU and maintained by the fishermen,” Morven explains.\u0026nbsp “They used to pack their catch in coolboxes or cover it with wet carpet, then drive for three hours to Plymouth and back. They now put their fish in there and it’s taken off to Plymouth market three times a week. The chillers have been such a success that they now want to build another building next to the chiller with lobster tanks – at the moment, if the weather’s rough lobsters are out in the pots rattling around, getting damaged or dying.The next stage is to increase awareness of Reserve Seafood, with plans to display the logo where it’s sold and promote the brand through their website www.lymebayreserve\u0026nbspcomplete with bios of the fisherman. The hope is that consumers will look out for the fish and create demand, as well as choosing to eat in restaurants that showcase this sustainable approach.Technology has its place too. “There’s an app on their phones and when they get on their boats they go through a geo-fence in the sky,” Morven explains. “So you can see exactly where the fish was caught. We can map this data on top of the habitats, to see which parts of the reserve are important for certain fisheries ... The rays seem to congregate on sandbanks one year we saw that all the pollock were being caught on one particular reef. And if they fall overboard, their phones send an SOS signal.”Jim adds: “It’s what I’ve done all my life. My father and grandfather were fishermen, two of my uncles still fish. Brett, my cousin, fishes from Lyme. My son runs the shop. But I can see this finishing when I finish.“You used to get boys coming down here to mess about on the boats at weekends, helping the fishermen with odd jobs and learning about our lives. But they don’t come now. Fishing isn’t seen as a desirable career.”He does admit it’s hard work:\u0026nbsp“I’ve only been out for half a day this week, and won’t be going out again until Monday, so that’s five days without fish – or income. We all have to have jobs on the side, such as building work and day tripping. And here in Beer we have to drag the boats up onto the beach using a tractor and wooden planks under the boats, greased with fat from the fish and chip shop.”Cod could be off the menu as climate change warms oceansSeabirds driven to the brink as fishing industry competes for foodThe women making their mark on Rwanda’s fishing industrySeabirds on British island suffer population crash due to lack of foodDespite the red tape, quotas, storms at sea and sheer unpredictability of what he does, seawater clearly runs through his veins. “People sometimes say ‘Oh, you’re just a fisherman’, but the job is highly skilled. You need to know where the fish are, how to predict the weather and stay safe.”It’s no surprise to learn that the fishermen look out for each other – just hearing their laughter and banter over who’s the best fisherman and the best darts player reveals an incredibly strong bond. “Even if we’ve been on a night out, we’ll all pass by the harbour on the way home in our glad rags and count the boats to make sure everyone’s in.”Angus adds, “We’ve had fishermen’s societies down here since the 19th century. Most people don’t really understand our world. We wouldn’t expect joe public to know about it, but those in charge of the industry should. Yet Defra\u0026nbspcan’t even tell us how much fish there is in the sea.”With so many obstacles and challenges, it’s easy to wonder why they still do it. Their comments were illuminating. Matt says, “If you looked at it purely financially you’d go off and do something else. What I love most is being close to nature: nothing can beat seeing the sun rise over the sea.”Bob in Axmouth agrees: “I love being out there with no one hassling you. We’re the last of the hunter-gatherers. For me, it’s an escape. I turn my phone off and it’s just me and the sea. I go out sometimes in my little 5-metre boat – usually 18 miles or so, but it can be up to 28 miles – and come back with nothing. But when you go out mid-morning, the sun over the sea is beautiful. We see lots of gannet, dolphins, even a killer whale outside Lyme Regis Bay once.” Perhaps it was the man from Defra.Visit bluemarinefoundation for more informationWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Many of M\u0026ampS’s customers\u0026nbspthat want online grocery shopping\u0026nbspare already Ocado customers, he says.“It may have overestimated the lure of M\u0026ampS products, and indeed the questionable benefits of being able to order an M\u0026ampS dress with a weekly shop.”\u0026nbspThe new tie-up can be a success but only if M\u0026ampS sticks to the premium products it’s famous for like, says George Lawrie, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester.“In other words, it will work for champagne, fresh oysters, canapes and caviar, but not for things like cling film and carrots,” he says. This marries with Ocado’s vision of a premium delivery experience, with smartly dressed drivers delivering your groceries straight to your kitchen table.Luxury deliveries work better because of cost, Lawrie explains.“Normally you’d expect picking, packing and transporting produce to amount to around 25-30 per cent of the cost of a single item, a cost that high margin retailers can absorb but low margin grocery cannot – unless everything is highly automated.”M\u0026ampS clearly can’t compete with the big supermarkets when it comes to customers’ weekly shops, says Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds shares in M\u0026ampS.He is also pessimistic about the deal, describing the £600m M\u0026ampS is raising to pay for the new venture as an “extravagant use of shareholders’ money”.“The motivations behind this deal for M\u0026ampS are clear, as the company has long struggled with an online offering that is not up to scratch.”The benefits to M\u0026ampS of an online food shopping are not certain because of the limited range of products it stocks, says Mumford. Consumers see it as a place to top up their weekly food shop with premium items, rather than somewhere for a large weekly shop.But that’s not so much a problem as it might once have been because Ocado has become less dependent on Waitrose products and now stocks broad range of own-brand and private label products, says Stephen Lienert, senior analyst at Jefferies.“Ocado therefore goes full circle: whereas before people used Ocado to access Waitrose products, now the supermarkets want to use Ocado.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” So, the initial emphasis will inevitably be on the vast back catalogues of\u0026nbspboth companies, going back to the 1950s. In principle, a viewer might chose to watch every episode of Coronation Street since it was first shown on\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspDecember\u0026nbsp1960, or the 5,875 episodes of EastEnders made since 1986. Either would make for\u0026nbspquite a binge.\u0026nbspEvery Morse, every Doctor Who (at least the ones where the tapes haven’t been wiped), every Avengers, and every Dad’s Army\u0026nbspevery Morecambe \u0026amp Wise show, every recent hit drama such as The Night Manager or Vera\u0026nbsp– all would be available on demand, for a subscription fee.\u0026nbspIn due course, though, the BBC and ITV hope to\u0026nbspcommission new series especially for BritBox, just as competitors such as Netflix\u0026nbspand Amazon do. How and when these series might find their way onto their conventional channels is unclear. Other things being equal, like many digital content providers in every field, they would have to offer their subscribers something special,\u0026nbspwhich is not available for free elsewhere, to justify the fees.How much will BritBox cost to the viewers?There is speculation that it might be as little as £5 per month, though this has not been confirmed, beyond the BBC and ITV saying it will be “competitive”. As with other streaming services, it might be available direct or via other data providers, such as BT in the UK.In principle, given the BBC’s charter, major licence fee funding might be problematic. ITV have pledged some £65million initially the BBC will not comment\u0026nbspon its financial commitment.Why are the BBC and ITV doing this now?The truth is, they have little choice. Streaming of high quality programming, using the Internet (and or satellite and cable) and bypassing traditional broadcasting methods, have caused massive disruption. Younger viewers, especially, are more likely to use the likes of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube for their video entertainment than they are to\u0026nbspsettle down with a cup of tea and a biscuit in front of Emmerdale or Newsnight. BBC to air rival Leaving Neverland Michael Jackson documentary ITV and the BBC\u0027s BritBox streaming service has potential BBC invites public to take control of its Brexit coverageThis fragmentation of the market is something that conventional broadcasters such as ITV and the BBC have dreaded for years – the moment of “peak television”, beyond which\u0026nbspviewing figures start to decline.The traditional broadcasters are also attracted by the prospect\u0026nbspof establishing a worldwide presence. Netflix, for example, has 56 million users – about the population of the UK. If BritBox can become a global player, then new possibilities for programming open up. Netflix commissions well over 100 new series a year – more than anyone else on the planet. If BritBox succeeds, it will create a virtuous circle where new shows attract new subscribers, and the revenues from their fees and any accompanying advertising is used to commission more shows, which will attract more viewers, and so on.If anything, the move is overdue. The new kids on the block\u0026nbsphave been eroding the BBC and ITV market share for some years. An attempt to create something like BritBox in the UK at the start of the decade was blocked by the competition authorities. They no longer seem inclined to do so.Will it succeed?Well, the BBC and ITV have a superb record when it comes to\u0026nbspcreating hit drama series\u0026nbspin particular, many of which have been popular worldwide. Comedies, documentaries, nature and arts programming might also attract major new audiences through the new platform. The BBC also has a global reputation for impartial and investigative\u0026nbspnews-gathering – an increasingly precious asset in a world of “fake news”.\u0026nbspMassive global hits such as The Crown (Netflix) or Game of Thrones (HBO) could easily have been made by the British broadcasters\u0026nbsp– but they now lack the financial heft to do so. To give one example,\u0026nbspthe budget for each episode of Amazon Prime’s The Grand Tour is about £4.5million for the BBC’s Top Gear it is £500,000. Why Roma’s awards-season success is such a big win for NetflixThe Beeb\u0026nbspand ITV are simply\u0026nbspbeing out-done commercially if not artistically. They are too small and too focused on the UK in what has rapidly become a globalised business.So the talent (Olivia Colman, as a symbol), the creativity and the expertise are all there – London is already a world centre for post-production and the UK has excellent film and studio facilities. What may be lacking is the business acumen that could really make the new service a success. ITV and BBC executives are simply too parochial and inexperienced in this field – as opposed to programme-making and dealing with awkward MPs – and would need to require some potentially expensive (possibly foreign) commercial nous to pilot them to success, just like Premier League football teams.Alternatively, in the longer run, they might consider forming some sort of more cooperative relationship with the\u0026nbspestablished streaming services, though again that would bring its own complications, not least because of the BBC\u0027s status as a state-owned broadcaster with no private shareholders and a unique agenda.Can I watch the very latest episodes of Emmerdale or Endeavour on there?Probably not. The idea is that the most recent and live material will still be broadcast on-line via the BBC’s existing iPlayer and ITV\u0027s Hub service (for all their various channels, including radio in the case of the BBC).What about Brexit?BritBox could be a pioneer of the new “global Britain”, an international player in a fast-developing market concentrating on the kind of value-added creative content that the world will pay good money for. British programming and show formats have traditionally sold well abroad, and this would be a massive extension of that tradition. Early days, but BritBox could be transformational.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

While it appears like a standard smartphone app on the surface, the key difference is that it will run on a peer-to-peer network – much like bitcoin.\u0026nbspThis means people\u0027s data will be spread across this network, rather than being stored on a centralised server. Users will also be able to earn rewards in the form of cosmee cryptocurency by actively participating in the community.Cosmee already has more than 30,000 daily active users in Korea, the firm tells\u0026nbspThe Independent, making it the second most popular beauty app in the country.\u0026nbspCan Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?The inclusion of such apps is anticipated to push cryptocurrency adoption even further into the mainstream, as people will ultimately be able to spend it and trade it on a daily basis. Contactless payments with cryptocurrencies could also be a possibility in the future, as the Galaxy S10\u0026nbsprange supports this functionality.Still more is needed before cryptocurrency becomes truly mainstream, with the final stumbling block mentioned by Mr Thomas being that of regulation. Though this may not be very far away, he warned.With regulation imminent from the UK\u0027s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), adoption of cryptocurrencies for both personal and investment purposes can only grow and with it the whole blockchain ecosystem, he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Due to a lack of knowledge about the past climate of Mars, scientists\u0026nbspcan not tell whether it came from\u0026nbspgroundwater, precipitation,\u0026nbspmelting glaciers or something unheard of.There is no liquid water on the surface of mars today, though plenty of similar ex-water features\u0026nbsphave been discovered in recent years, suggesting Mars once had a far wetter and warmer climate.Each discovery raises further questions about the planet\u0027s past atmosphere and\u0026nbspscientists ultimately want to know whether or not it would have been suitable for life.Next year the ESA in collaboration with Russia’s space program Roscomos will launch the ExoMars mission with the primary goal to “address the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars.Here The Independent has collated images\u0026nbspfrom recently discovered evidence of water on Mars in the gallery above.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But we want an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. We regret this decision but that’s the reality.”Theresa May offered the option of an extension to MPs\u0026nbspon Tuesday in a bid to head off another Commons defeat.Under the prime minister’s plan, MPs will be asked to vote again on her\u0026nbspdeal on\u0026nbsp12 March. Should it be rejected, they will be asked to vote on 13 March on whether the UK should leave without a deal.If both of those are rejected, there will be another vote on 14 March\u0026nbspon an extension to Article 50, which would delay Brexit.But Mr Macron’s suggestion that the UK would need to make a “new choice” for an extension to be granted\u0026nbspthrows a ner in the works of Downing Street’s timeline.Though the French president did not elaborate on what such a choice might entail, the EU has been pushing the UK to soften the terms of Brexit. Mr Macron’s statement also suggests time might be granted were the UK to decide to hold a second referendum, which Labour said it would back\u0026nbspearlier this week.Last week European Council president Donald Tusk said he believed an extension to Article 50 was a “rational” course of action for the UK to take, following a meeting with Theresa May. He added, however, that the prime minister still believed she could avoid an extension.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.Mr Corbyn’s “constructive ambiguity” on Brexit has long frustrated those in his party who back a People’s Vote and played a part in eight of the MPs who defected going to form the new Independent Group last week.Labour’s annual conference voted to keep a second referendum on the table, but made it clear that the party’s priority was an early election to allow it to implement its Brexit plan for a customs union with a UK say, close ties with the single market and dynamic alignment with EU workplace and environmental regulations.Speaking to MPs on Monday, Mr Corbyn said Labour would put forward its plans in an amendment to the government’s Brexit motion on Wednesday, but was also committed to “putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.What happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?A briefing note to Labour MPs made clear the party would back the inclusion of remaining in the EU on the ballot paper, as an alternative to a “credible Leave option”, but would not back no-deal being a choice on offer.But some raised concerns that the party could still dodge backing a People’s Vote, after frontbencher Richard Burgon tweeted: “Disappointing that Labour’s Brexit motion didn’t pass. But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no-deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal or staying in our current EU deal.”Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour could push for a referendum as soon as Theresa May’s deal comes back to parliament.He told ITV’s Peston: “When the meaningful vote comes back, and we are told maybe that might be on March 12, there are rumours today that it could be next week, we will see.\u0026nbspThat’s the time when we will have to put the amendment up.”However, he added: “We are still going to argue that we want a general election, we are still going to argue we think our deal that we have put up was the best option.\u0026nbspBut we realise\u0026nbspwe have got to break this deadlock.”He suggested that “either a deal will go through which will protect jobs and the economy or, to get some deal through, it will be conditional on going back to the people”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Other brewers use the name of a deity in their beers so I obviously never thought anything bad about it.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

certainly like to see more active involvement of the United States,” he told reporters.India says it shot down Pakistani plane in clash on Kashmir borderCan India and Pakistan now call it even?Why is there conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir?At the same time, he said the lack of US\u0026nbspcondemnation of India’s strike on Pakistan is “construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more.”Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan called for talks with India and hoped “better sense” would prevail so that both sides could

My question is that, given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation,” Mr Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. “We should sit down and talk.”The Pakistan government’s official Twitter account released a video of a man it claimed was an Indian pilot who had been shot down.The man, whom Pakistan has named as Wing Commander Abhi Nandan and whose face was bloodied and blindfolded, gives his name and service number before telling a man questioning him: “I’m sorry sir, that’s all I’m supposed to tell you.”A statement from India’s foreign ministry said the pilot’s treatment was a “vulgar display of an injured personnel of the Indian Air Force in violation of all norms of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention,” ordering his immediate release. India has not yet named the pilot.Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India’s parliament.The latest escalation marks a sudden turnaround in relations between the two countries, both of which claim Kashmir in full, but only rule in part.Follow how we covered the news as it unfoldedPakistan claims to have captured two Indian pilots\u0026nbspin Kashmir\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspImran Khan calls for talks with India to deescalate tension\u0026nbspIndia claims to have shot down\u0026nbspPakistani jetUS urges two nations to \u0027prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity\u0027Pakistan closes airspace\u0026nbspto all flightsWelcome to The Independent\u0027s coverage\u0026nbspon the escalation\u0026nbspbetween India and Pakistan.Pakistan\u0026nbsphad said it had no choice but to respond to India\u0027s attack on its territory but did not want to escalate the crisis and avoided hitting military targets or causing casualties in an air strike, the main military spokesman said.Major\u0026nbspGeneral\u0026nbspAsif Ghafoor, head of the military press wing, said\u0026nbspPakistani jets had locked on to six targets in a demonstration of their capacity to hit key installations but had deliberately avoided causing any damage.We engaged a nearby open space where there were no humans or military installation, he told a news conference in Islamabad.Here is the chronology of the latest escalations according to Pakistan:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Pakistani aircraft fired on Indian targets in open ground from within their airspace to demonstrate their capabilities.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- In response two Indian jets were scrambled and flew into Pakistani airspace.\u0026nbsp- These jets were shot down and two Indian pilots have been captured by Pakistan.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said on Wednesday the group has not issued any press statement about the ongoing clashes between\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspand Pakistan.Mujahid told Reuters that the statement circulating about their comments on\u0026nbspIndia, Pakistan clashes was fake.We have not said that\u0026nbspIndia, Pakistan clashes will affect the Afghan peace process. The press statement shared on social media and with news companies is fake.\u0026nbspIndian news reports say that airports in the\u0026nbspIndian portion of Kashmir have been closed for civilian traffic shortly after an\u0026nbspIndian air force jet crashed in the area.\u0026nbspThe Press Trust of\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspnews agency says these airports are located at Srinagar, Jammu and Leh.\u0026nbspIndian authorities declined to comment.\u0026nbspPakistan Armed Forces spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor has said that Air Force\u0026nbspjets selected six “non-military” targets in Indian administered Kashmir and locked these targets.\u0026nbspBut we did not fire at these targets and instead fired at a safe distance just to show we were capable but did not, he said.US secretary of state\u0026nbspMike Pompeo urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and avoid escalation at any cost, after Pakistan carried out air strikes and shot down two Indian jets on Wednesday.\u0026nbspHe said he\u0026nbsphad spoken to foreign ministers from India\u0026nbspand Pakistan and encouraged both Ministers to prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity.Major general\u0026nbspAsif Ghafoor said one of the pilots was injured and was\u0026nbspbeing treated in a military hospital. The other is in custody.\u0026nbspHe said they were\u0026nbsp are being treated well but made no mention of whether they would be returned to India.A video has been released which is reportedly from the Pakistani government, which apparently shows\u0026nbspone of the Indian pilots who has been captured.The man, whose face is bloodied and blindfolded, gives his name and service number, before telling a man questioning him: I\u0027m sorry sir, that\u0027s all I\u0027m supposed to tell you.Indian officials previously said three\u0026nbspPakistani jets had also entered Indian airspace, before being intercepted and forced turned back.\u0026nbspIndia\u0027s\u0026nbspforeign ministry\u0026nbsphas called a briefing to give a response to all the latest developments in Kashmir.\u0026nbspHere is the video,\u0026nbspwhich is reportedly from the Pakistani government, that apparently shows\u0026nbspone of the Indian pilots who has been captured.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIndian airports in Kashmir have reportedly reopened as the restrictions that were put in place after tensions with the Pakistani air force escalated have now been\u0026nbsplifted.Raveesh Kumar, a spokesperson for the Indian government,\u0026nbsphas claimed the they have\u0026nbspshot down a\u0026nbspPakistani jet.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

They agree a sortie of multiple Indian aircraft crossed the “line of control” into Pakistan-administered Kashmir, although not by much, and fired towards a town called Balakot.They agree\u0026nbspthe operation was conducted in a matter of moments – an incursion of just one-and-a-half minutes in total, according to Indian defence sources – and that Pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets in response.And that’s about it. For while India’s foreign secretary issued a statement describing the Tuesday morning air raid as a successful mission to avert an imminent terror attack, Pakistan’s armed forces insisted it did nothing more than scuff up some dirt and knock over a few trees. No infrastructure damaged, and no loss of life.Neither side is yet to prove their point. India may yet, as it did during a similar incident in 2016, produce satellite images which it claims show the destruction. One government minister said the operation had “completely destroyed” the largest training camp belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the militant group behind Kashmir’s deadliest car bombing earlier this month. It’s the sort of damage that before-and-after imagery should easily pick up.Created with Sketch.Fire on the streets as Indians react to the Pulwama bombing attack Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Indian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirPakistan’s foreign ministry said its side of the border was open for domestic and international journalists alike to themselves check for any signs of damage. Indeed, the ministry\u0026nbspsaid it was taking independent military observers to inspect the scene.But where to look? In the confusion after the event, the two sides could not even agree on which Balakot had been targeted – one in Pakistan-administered Kashmir or, and which would be a more serious incursion, one in Pakistan proper. Specifically, in the region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – prime minister Imran Khan’s home province.Here in India, the government has been preparing both practically and rhetorically for an operation like Tuesday morning’s. Since the 14 February Pulwama bombing, the government\u0026nbsphas collected statements of solidarity and support for action in the face of terror\u0026nbspfrom more than 48 other countries. And in the last few days, security forces in India’s Jammu and Kashmir have pre-emptively rounded up more than 300 suspected separatist agitators.Narendra Modi had promised a “jaw-breaking” response to that car bombing in Pulwama,\u0026nbspcarried out by a young local man but prepared by JeM,\u0026nbspwhich killed 40 paramilitary police officers, and in this context made a substantial retaliatory attack seem inevitable – even justified.In his statement, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said the sortie only hit terrorist assets and thus was not an act of aggression against either the Pakistani military or civilians. He creatively described it as “non-military pre-emptive action”.India raises customs duty on goods from Pakistan to 200 per centIndia says Pakistan had ‘direct hand’ in Kashmir bomb attackIndia warns Pakistan of ‘jaw-breaking reply’ after suicide bomb attackWhat is Kashmir Solidarity Day and how is it observed?Pakistan does not view it that way, though. It has not only denied any state involvement in Pulwama, but demanded India provide evidence for the claim that JeM prepared the attack from Pakistani soil.The country’s own foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said the airstrikes were\u0026nbspa “grave aggression”, and prime minister\u0026nbspImran Khan vowed that “Pakistan shall respond at the time and place of its choosing”.At the same time it played down the impact of the airstrikes. Mr Khan said that “once again\u0026nbspthe Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim”, suggesting\u0026nbspthe Indian account was “for domestic consumption” in the runup to imminent elections.He is not the only one pointing out that an escalating conflict with Pakistan plays well for Mr Modi and his nationalist BJP in the polls.A Reuters survey showed a marked uptick in support for Mr Modi in the immediate aftermath of the 14 February attack. He was, after all, swept to power in 2014 at least partly thanks to the image he portrayed of himself as a strong leader.Sure enough, it wasn’t long after news of the airstrikes broke on Tuesday that videos started doing the rounds on social media of jingoistic displays of Indian flag-waving, anti-Pakistan chants and the burning of Pakistan flags. One analyst who did not wish to be named told me he did not believe a surgical strike had been necessary and that it had been “orchestrated for the election”.Another defence expert, Dr Gopalan Balachandran, said the airstrikes were “clearly motivated by the JeM attack in Kashmir”. He said the death toll in Pulwama had been “intolerable” to most Indians, and that Mr Modi “needed to show that he was doing something about it”.Since 14 February, a number of opposition parties have broached the topic of the BJP making political hay out of the Pulwama attack. West Bengal’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee went as far as accusing the Modi administration of wanting to instil “war hysteria”, leading the BJP’s state president to accuse her of making “baseless allegations to score political brownie points” herself.It would be too soon for anyone to do the same on Tuesday night. Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj emerged from a cross-party security briefing to state that “all parties in one voice praised the security forces and supported the government’s anti-terror operations”.So what next for Pakistan? Mr Khan has called for both houses of the country’s parliament to sit on Wednesday to discuss the situation, and he has also summoned an emergency meeting of the National Command Authority\u0026nbsp– the body that oversees Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal.Amid the high-stakes sabre-rattling, Mr Khan has little option but to offer a military retaliation, analysts say.In ordinary circumstances it would need to be “proportionate” – but does that mean destroying a base of 300 Indian paramilitary officers, or a copse of trees? Before the country\u0026nbspcan decide on a response to today’s events, Pakistan will need to settle on – and convince others – of its version of exactly what occurred.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Today was the 14th time Mr Putin and Mr Netanyahu\u0026nbsphad met in the last decade alone. That is a record in Israeli-Russian history\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand a record for any non-post-Soviet leader inside Putin’s Kremlin. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.US President Donald Trump (left) shakes hands with North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong-un following a meeting at the Sofitel Legend pole hotel in HanoiAn Indian paramilitary solider fires tear gas shell towards Kashmiri protesters in Srinagar.

Tens of thousands of mostly barefoot Filipino Catholics joined the annual procession of a centuries-old statue of Jesus Christ to celebrate the Feast of the Black Nazarene which usually ends before dawn the next dayBut the immediate backdrop to Wednesday’s meeting mirrored the frost\u0026nbspon the ground as the Israelis touched town early morning at Moscow\u0027s Vnukovo-2 airport. It was the first time Mr Netanyahu had been granted a sit-down meeting\u0026nbspwith Mr Putin since a Russian spy plane was downed over Syria in September. it was\u0026nbspa tragedy that cost 15 Russian lives and\u0026nbspthat an emotional Kremlin blamed entirely\u0026nbspon Israel.Added to that were continued tensions about the role of Iran in Syria amid the contradictions of Russian foreign policy, which tries to ally with everyone in the region.\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu referred to those tensions in his opening pitch in the Kremlin. Iran and its proxies posed the greatest threat to regional security, he said: “We are determined to continue our aggressive activity against Iran, which calls for our destruction, and against its attempts to establish itself militarily in Syria.”But the Israeli leader also understood he needed something to break the ice,\u0026nbspand get the relationship back on track. So he\u0026nbspturned to obvious sweet spots. Close cooperation with the Russian military was what ensured security in the Middle East, he said. Mr Putin, who had up to this point listened with a stone face, brow raised, nodded his head.\u0026nbspThen, Mr Netanyahu went further. In the near future, he said, a new memorial to the victims of the Siege of Leningrad would be inaugurated in Jerusalem. Perhaps Mr President would be willing to officiate at its opening?As far as state invitations went, it could hardly have been more personal. Mr Putin might have been born six years after the 872-day siege of his home town ended, but he lost a brother he never knew to to that grim page of Russian history.His entire childhood, as his city rebuilt itself, was spent in the\u0026nbspshadow of Leningrad\u0027s Siege.\u0026nbspDaughter of Putin\u0027s spokesman working in European Parliament as internRussia state TV channel lists nuclear targets in USPoroshenko accused of \u0027state treason\u0027 as rival attempts impeachmentMr Putin switched from poker face to a smile.\u0026nbsp“Thank you, I will come,” he said. “The memory of those who died in the Second World War — of the Jews and of those in Leningrad — is sacred.”\u0026nbspIt was a good start for Mr Netanyahu, but whether it was enough to translate into negotiation success on Iran was another thing.\u0026nbspBefore leaving for Moscow, the Israeli premier\u0026nbspsaid he aimed to use the meeting to\u0026nbsp “prevent Iranian entrenchment in Syria.” The presence of Iranian forces close to Golan on the Israeli border — in apparent contravention of a Russian-brokered deal to withdraw the forces to at least 80km (50 miles) — were of particular concern, he said.According to Jonathan Spyer, Research Fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, few issues are as fundamental\u0026nbspto Israel as the question of containing Iran.\u0026nbspIt was an issue that commanded support across the entire political spectrum from left to right, he added.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Israel also believed that it has a shared interest in supporting\u0026nbspMoscow\u0026nbspas the regional power broker.\u0026nbspBut the Kremlin’s careful balancing of its regional alliances meant it was unlikely Jerusalem would be celebrating any major new concessions.The Independent understands the Kremlin feels that it has already done enough to accommodate Israeli concerns — and in particular on the border deal.\u0026nbsp“Moscow knows Netanyahu is bringing a list of Iranian and Hezbollah targets, and the sides will likely agree to coordinate, but that is about it,” said Yuri Barmin, an expert at the Russian International Affairs Council.Russia has “already reached its limits” on pressuring Iran, agrees Vladimir Frolov, a security expert and former Kremlin adviser.\u0026nbsp“We are at a point where the Iranians could tell us where to go and begin moving around Syria the way they please,” he said. “The best Israel can hope for is a deconfliction policy where Russians don’t shoot down Israeli planes if they avoid Russian assets and personnel.\u0026nbsp“The rest is God-knows-what-he-is-doing kind of thing.” \u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s top diplomat and a pillar of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, was back at work Wednesday standing alongside president Hassan Rouhani to welcome Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan to the Iranian capital on a state visit broadcast live on television.“It is the belief of myself and the supreme leader you are a trusted, brave and devout inidual standing on the front line against America’s multilateral pressures,” Mr Rouhani wrote in a letter published Wednesday on the official presidential website. “I think your resignation is against the country’s interests and I do not accept it.”The show of support could bolster Mr\u0026nbspZarif’s\u0026nbspposition within the Iranian political establishment – but it could also paint Mr\u0026nbspZarif\u0026nbspas a somewhat thin-skinned and petty political player after he\u0026nbspallegedly resigned after being excluded from meetings with the Syrian president.Created with Sketch.Revolution in Iran: in pictures Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstration against the Shah in 1979Armed women on guard in one of the main squares in Tehran at the beginning of the Iranian RevolutionDemonstrators hold a poster of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in January 1979, in Tehran, during a demonstration against the ShahIranian rebels pose with a U.S. flag they bayonetted upside down on trees at Sultanabad Garrison northeast of Tehran on February 12 2019A gun battle in Khorramshahr during the revolution, 1979Ayatollah Khomeini\u0027s supporters demonstrate in the streets of Tehran against the Shah among tear gas.

Many had feared Mr\u0026nbspZarif’s\u0026nbspdeparture could weaken attempts to keep Iran’s nuclear programme in check.“People are policy, and having made the deal, he would be one of its most fervent advocates inside the system,” a former senior western official who was closely involved in the years-long negotiations preceding the deal told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Mr\u0026nbspZarif\u0026nbspannounced\u0026nbsphis resignation hours after photos appeared online showing him being excluded from meetings during a state visit by Syria’s ruler,\u0026nbspBashar\u0026nbspal-Assad. \u0026nbspBut Mr\u0026nbspRouhani\u0026nbspand scores of Iranian lawmakers and diplomats demanded he stay on.Iranian news outlets across the political spectrum asked him to also remain in his position. Even conservative voices such as\u0026nbspVatan-e\u0026nbspEmrooz, which described his resignation as “childish”, opined that he should stay. The\u0026nbsphardline\u0026nbspKayhan, declared: “It is no time to resign.

Photos of Mr Soleimani with Mr Rouhani and Mr Assad had apparently rankled Mr Zarif, who claimed his absence from a key state visit weakened his position internationally. But Mr Soleimani said Mr Zarif’s absence was the result of a slip-up.“Mr Zarif is definitely responsible for the Islamic Republic’s foreign policy and during his tenure at the Foreign Ministry he has constantly had the support of the establishment’s highest authorities, including the supreme leader,” he said, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s highest authority, in a statement carried by news outlets. In an Instagram post published Wednesday morning, around the same time Mr Rouhani formally rejected his resignation, Mr Zarif vowed to continue in his job.He wrote: “As a mere servant, I have had no other concern but the glory of foreign policy and the credibility of the Foreign Ministry as the body responsible for developing foreign policy.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470961972.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says corbyn ian austin","story":"His resignation is even more signicant than that of the others, except the Jewish MP Luciana Berger, in that he did not scuttle off to join a second referendum pressure group.He was a Remainer too but, unlike them, intends to keep his election promises to see the result through.Austin is a veteran Labour man, now “ashamed” of Corbyn and his Marxist mates.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie. Deceive. Betray. Dissemble. They can delay Brexitthey want but there will be no rebuilding the country’s trust. Not for years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed.”The spokesperson added: “The Home Secretary must now demonstrate that this decision was taken in an objective and impartial way, and driven by clear and new evidence, not by his leadership ambitions.”Home Office aide Racheal Maclean said Labour’s stance was “shocking”. She said: “It’s shocking but not at all surprising that Corbyn fails to stand up to appalling terrorists and anti-semites who beyond any doubt seek the destruction of Israel and their allies.”Labour’s London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Monday said the ban was “long overdue”.Tory deputy chair James Cleverly last night stormed: “There has long been cross-party cooperation on national security, but Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party continues to reject the values that once united people across the political ide.“His refusal to back our decision to ban the antisemitic terrorist organisation Hizballah is yet another example of why even ex-Labour MPs think he is not fit to lead the Labour Party, let alone the country.”Labour last night said it would not oppose Sajid Javid’s “overall” motion which also called for the proscription of Jamaat Nusrat al Islam Wall Muslimin and Ansaroul Islam.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This route of transmission is more likely because of increasing bat-human contact.In fact, he goes on to say that the likelihood of bat flu infecting livestock and humans is probably high, due to the fact that bat-borne flu viruses are quite common around the globe.Importantly, because of increasing human contacts with wildle, including bats, consumption of bat bushmeat and hunting bats for both food and money has exposed humans to the zoonotic spillover of viruses.Muhammed says that eating bats could put us at risk of other viral and bacterial infections.So its a no to eating bats , and a watch this space to seeany livestock have fallen victim to bat flu."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000406141674-e1540908854709.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit migration lose cash","story":"Delays to rolling out the new welfare system mean that between , and , people will be forced to apply for Universal Credit by  -

like moving house or having a child.And hundreds of thousands will lose out substantially due to delays in the rollout, MPs were told today by Policy in Practice.Amber Rudd has said that .million Brits will naturally move over onto the new benefits system this year alone, and MPs are worried many will have to cope with sudden drops in income.The Sun revealed last month that DWP bosses have stopped people with severe disabilities from going over onto the new system until they have the safety net in place.Anyone who gets transferred from the old system to the new one - which hasnt yet started - will get help to make sure they dont lose out.But  per cent of households are on track to lose £. per week under Universal Credit, and wont be able to access transitional protection cash while they move over.The experts recommended that the DWP make Brits on benefits aware of any changes in circumstances that could force them onto Universal Credit, so they can make informed decisions on their future.Those most at risk of losing out are the self-employed on low incomes , home-owners who get tax creditsor households with savings who then go onto the new system.Zoe Charlesworth from Policy in Practice said today: People should be able to check what impact a move to Universal Credit will have on their income before making le changing decisions.And the emphasis should be on cushioning the shock to those households.The organisation is concerned about people who are getting student grants and loans, old industrial disabilities and spousal maintenance on the old system -

The entertainment giant would not have let him go unless it had to.Yet Disney chief executive Bob Iger paid tribute to Lasseter, saying he had taken “breathtaking risks” in his work, “telling original, high-quality stories”.Only once he was truly gone did one staff member feel brave enough to speak openly about his reign of sexism.Graphic designer Cassandra Smolcic said: “When I started at Pixar as an intern, I thought I’d landed my dream job.But my excitement was quickly tempered by a flood of warnings about Lasseter’s touchy-feely, boundary-crossing tendencies with female employees.”She claimed he would letch after women and touch them in “unwanted” ways.Her superiors feared Lasseter might try something on with Cassandra, but rather than punishing him she says they punished her.Cassandra alleged: “Just after starting on Cars , I was told by a superior that I’d be uninvited from all our weekly art department meetings because Lasseter ‘has a hard time controlling himself’ around young women.”It is staff like Cassandra who Emma believes should be protected from Lasseter.Skydance, which has made Baywatch, several Mission: Impossible films and the two most recent Star Treks, had it written into his contract that he should behave professionally.This did not reassure Emma. She wrote: “If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for himthe only reason he’s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave ‘professionally’ ”No criminal charges were ever levelled at Lasseter.When he joined Skydance in January, he spoke to staff for  minutes, trying to reassure them he was a changed man.He also told them he was working with a therapist to help him overcome “unconscious bias”.This reflected another allegation made against him during his time at Disney — that he had promoted men rather than women.Most notably Lasseter replaced Brenda Chapman with Mark Andrews as director on Brave, even though she had come up with the idea of the Scottish princess.Female animators are far from convinced that the industry will become safer and fairer for them.Marge Dean, of pressure group Women In Animation, said after Lasseter had been given his second chance: “The announcement triggered in me the same feelings that I’ve had in abuse situations... I felt disregarded and trivialised.”For now — to paraphrase Buzz Lightyear’s catchphrase in Toy Story — it seems Lasseter’s career has already gone to infamy and beyond. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But bizarrely the ministerial aide, who has Italian parents, was forced to quit so he could table the amendment. It came after Home Secretary Sajid Javid had backed the move saying there was “nothing wrong” with it. The Brexit U-turn came just  hours after the Prime Minister suggested she could not support his plan.   Mr Costa had urged Mrs May to push for the rights of all British nationals settled in the EU, and EU citizens here, to be ringfenced in a no deal scenario. But she told him: “If it’s not within that withdrawal agreement then it is a matter for inidual states, and we have already taken that up with inidual states.” The Tory MP accused her of hiding behind process.

He said that any request from Britain would need to be justied by “a clear perspective on the goal,” adding: “We don’t need time, we need decisions.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel, however, said the EU would not oppose any request for an extension. Labour also formally commited to supporting a second referendum after its own Brexit alternative was defeated. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer confirmed Labour would back or table an amendment in favour of a public vote between a deal and Remain.But Jeremy Corbyn ’s spokesman raised Labour temperatures by suggesting “other outcomes” could still be on the table.There were also early signs that some Tory eurosceptics could swing in behind the PM’s deal.

An expert warned families are suffering under a regime that shunts people onto the six-in-one benefit - without any transition cash. Existing benefit claimants are meant to switch to UC from mid- under a poundbn fund to protect their incomes. Yet families with a change in circumstances are already being moved over - without this protection.  MPs heard these changes can be as simple as a child’s fth birthday, when Income Support ends for some single parents. Policy in Practice warned % of UC claimants will lose out by an average of pound a week compared to the old system.   Meanwhile % are expected to gain by pound a week, the think tank told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee. Policy manager Zoe Charlesworth warned the system has caused some real dficulties for claimants and is much tougher on people forced to move due to a change of circumstances. There are some inidual circumstances where that test and learn approach should be learning - where people are suffering because of the natural migration, she said. Some million people are expected to be on UC by Christmas without any transition payments. While many will be new claimants who werent on benefits before, many others will be moved due to a change of circumstances - known as natural migration. Last month the Mirror revealed more than , parents and workers had been moved from Tax Credits onto UC in this way.   Other changes of circumstances include when people move house, have a break-up, start or stop being a carer or have their first child. Kayley Hignell of Citizens Advice told MPs: All of those people don’t get transitional protection. They are going through a change in circumstances that can be hard. MPs heard people who fail fit-for-work tests for sickness benefit ESA are even choosing to go without cash rather than claim UC. Ms Charlesworth said: They then have a choice - they can either claim UCthey’re putting in an appeal and get some money, or they can live on nothing, hope they get an appeal, and then they’re allowed to get back onto ESA. They have to live with nothing.  They have to make a sort of bet with themselves really on which way it’s going to go.

A poll of , adults revealed the days we would most – and least – like to be born on. Unsurprisingly, a January birthday is considered one of the worst times in the calendar to emerge into the world. One in seven said they would like their birthday to fall on the summer solstice –  June, which is the longest day of the year. Christmas Day was voted the worst day of the year for your big day to land, followed by a ‘leap year day’ on  February.   The research was undertaken by Dr. Oetker to celebrate the ‘forgotten birthdays’ of Leaplings – a minority of Brits who only officially celebrate their birthday once every four years because they were born on th February, a date that only occurs during leap years. The disadvantages of being born on th February are, according to the poll, not knowing what day to celebrate on , tiring of jokes about their unusual birthdayand missing out on cake . Spokesperson Emma Haworth said: “Most of us take for granted our birthdays happen every year, but what happens to the people born on th February  “While they still have another year to wait to celebrate their birthday, we want to make  their year. Despite missing out on their birthday this year, next year Leaplings will celebrate their special day on a Saturday, which was selected as the best day of the week to have a birthday.   More than half of the population still hope to receive a cake on their special day every year, though  per cent will find themselves having to go without. Over one in six say they like to bake a cake from scratch to make the recipient feel special on their big day. Meanwhile,  per cent of bakers admit to baking birthday cakes because they taste better than ones bought from a shop. Dr. Oetker spokesperson, Emma Haworth added: “The act of baking itself stirs up powerful feelings of happiness and excitement, from the thrill of weighing out ingredients to the first triumphant forkful. “That’s why Dr.Oetker is encouraging people to bake someone’s birthday cake.” Seventy one per cent of Brits believe they are never too old for homemade birthday cake and candles. Six in  Brits believe homemade cakes taste better than shop-bought, and they’re also more likely to bake one for a friend or relative than buy one.   Proving that we’re a nation of chocolate lovers, a chocolate cake was deemed the best birthday cake flavour. This was closely followed by a classic Victoria sponge, then a lemon drizzle and decadent chocolate fudge, according to the OnePoll research. Eighty four per cent insist on having candles on top of their cake, though  per cent wont make a wish when they blow them out. The best thing about birthdays is being surrounded by friends and family, followed by loads of presents and home baked birthday cake.To celebrate Dr Oetker have gted  three-tiered cakes to mark their three quarter-birthday to  ‘Leaplings’ including the UK’s first set of Leapling triplets, India, Savannah and Alicia Philips from Wolverhampton. Dancer, India Philips, who is about to turn , said: ‘I love homemade birthday cakes because it shows that someone has put a lot of thought and care into your birthday to make your day extra special.” Student Savannah Phillips said: I love being a triplet but sometimes we do have to share a birthday cake.

The report said: “Extensive enquiries with BHPA schools, clubs and paramotor rated pilots in Northern Ireland regarding whether any paramotorpilots were operating in that area on the th August, have drawn a complete blank. “However, the BHPA would like to add that a number of non- BHPA paramotor pilots operate in Northern Ireland who may not have had the benefit of any formal training in airmanship, air law or airspace restrictions.” Timo Anderson, Flybe’s Chief Operating Officer, said: “We note the findings contained in the Airprox Report relating to an incident which occurred on th August  when an unidentied paramotor infringed controlled airspace and came into close proximity with Flybe flight BE on its approach to Belfast City Airport.

Ross Mclaughlan, , says he was left speechless when he received a letter from the Child Maintenance Service back in  telling him he had a teenage daughter. The -year-old, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, was not married and claims he had no idea who the girls mum was.He told the Daily Mail : I was so confused and didn’t recognise either the girl’s name or her mother’s, but told myself they’d either got the wrong Ross Mclaughlan, or that someone had targeted me as part of some scam.I was very wrong. It’s eight years since that letter arrived and, despite me never having seen or even spoken to the girl named in it, nor having any contact with her mother, I’ve had pound, deducted from my wages and been told I owe a further pound,.”   Ross says he initially tried to ignore the letter but then decided to pay the pound-a-month sum so it wouldnt jeopardise his job. He refused to take a DNA test as he felt it went against his human rights. But four years ago, he was hit with another letter from the CMS, telling him that the child support costs were increasing to pound a month. If he paid, it would mean he was left with an income of just pound after tax.   So he decided to look into the case further and request a copy of the girls birth certicate, which he says showed a dferent mans name under the father section - one who had the same surname as the girl and her mother. Ross immediately wrote to the CMS hoping that would be enough evidence to prove he wasnt the father and stop the payments. But he received a reply saying the certicate was not enough proof that the man was the child’s biological dad and so the money kept going out of his account. Things got even worse when the daughter turned  and he was told that he would have to pay a further pound, in retrospective payments. Ross described the whole case as being extortion and likened it to something that happens in a fascist state.   The woman claims she fell pregnant after a short fling with Ross and gave birth to their daughter in June . Her ex-husband allegedly became suspicious and requested a DNA test which proved the girl wasnt his, according to the woman. The daughter told the paper that she did wonder why Ross didnt get in touch when he found out about her from the CSA. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions, which oversees the CMS, said: “We noty people before making deductions, to ensure they have a chance to contest parentage. When parentage is disputed we look for conclusive proof such as a DNA test or a court declaration. A birth certicate can be used as evidence, but would be discountedthere’s a suggestion that it’s unreliable.

This is because staff at a branch of the chain Sonic Drive-In had walked out on their jobs and left a rather explicit note in the window revealing why. In the A message, the Ex Sonic Crew members said they refused to work for the company any longer, claiming it all came down to terrible management following the recent sale of the business. According to Now, the company went under new management on February .   But clearly staff werent impressed with their new bosses and werent afraid to tell them so, sticking the brutal letter up for all to see. It reads: Warning, due to terrible management the whole store has quit. The company has been sold to people that dont give a f*** about anyone but themselves. They apologised for any inconvenience their actions caused before explaining why they had to leave.   Our team refuses to work for a company that treats their employees like they are s*** when they have put everything into this store. We have worked too hard for too long. We are all off to better things. They added: So to the new owners, F*** YOU! Sincerely, Ex Sonic Crew. And according to reports, these staff members werent the only ones who walked out, with teams at two other Sonic Drive-In locations believed to have followed suit.   Scioto Post reports workers at the Lancaster Sonic also left a note, but it was much tamer, saying: goodbye and thank you, next. Sources close to the situation told the publication that part of the dispute was caused by pay cuts, which allegedly saw wages reduced from minimum wage to just an hour. Its currently unclear when the stores will re-open, but another branch in the area has reportedly closed for good. A Sonic spokesperson told WSYX: Under new management, guests and the community can look forward to improved service and the famous food, beverages and treats for which Sonic is known. Employees working for the local drive-in can look forward to fun, fast-paced work on which they can build a career,they choose.

And one woman was certainly left wondering whether she was in a sci-fi movie after spotting some sinister looking pods hanging from her neighbours tree.She claims the pods are currently dangling over into her garden and are quite close to her childrens trampoline, reports news.au.Concerned about what might be inside the bizarre things, she decided to ask the internet for help with identying the large sacs.  In a post on Facebook , the Australian woman wrote: At the risk of looking like I have no idea , anyone know what these dangling things might be from the tree next door Wonderingits something a little sinister. She added that the pods appeared to have spider webs around them, then shared a series of photographs to give people a better idea of what she was dealing with.And to her horror she was then told that the so-called pods were probably filled with around  baby spiders each.  Locals from the Sydney area began suggesting that the sacs could be the work of magnicent spiders or bolas spiders. One woman said the spiders were super cool and would parachute down with little parachute webs when the eggs hatch. But this did little to appease the mum, who wasnt impressed with the thought of spiders coming down onto the trampoline.  Despite the disturbing situation, the spiders should pose no threat to the woman according to the Australian Plants Society NSW.They said that magnicent spiders pose no threat to humans and revealed that the spindle-shaped egg sacs take several nights to construct. Baby spiders will emerge from the sacs in late winter, before they are carried away by the wind.

The group sprang up in the US in the s but by  had  communities around the world. Followers were encouraged to imagine Jesus was present when they were having sex. Mr Berg issued a “Mo Letter” containing a list of things you could say to Jesus while you pretended you were making love to him. These included X-rated phrases such as “I receive your love, Lord, with open arms and open legs” and “flood me with your seeds”.    The book alleges Mr Berg was fine with female homosexuality, but described two men making love to one another as “distasteful”. Ms Thornely said: “Women — whether they felt like it or not — were required to share themselves sexually with other men in the Children of God homes. It was considered a duty, and a duty that was only required of women. “Within the Children of God, adult men only had sex when they wanted to, but very frequently, adult women had sex when they didn’t want to and with people they did not want to have sex with.”   Mr Berg, who died in , also instructed women to dance for him, the book alleges. He liked the women to fondle themselves while they danced but any woman who was heavily pregnant or had “sagging breasts” had to cover up. “Thanks to his love of sexism and exploitation, Berg taught his followers that women were made for men. They’re God’s way of saying, ‘Here, I love you, so I made you a thing with boobs on it,’” Ms Thornley added.  Ms Thornley explores ious cults across the world in her book Zealots. The blurb reads: Why would anyone join a cult  Maybe theyre unhappy with their current religion, or they want to change the world, or theyre disappointed with their lives and want to find something bigger or holier that makes sense of this confusing, chaotic and dangerous world. Or maybe they just want to give themselves the best possible chance of having sex with aliens.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end.

It is the time of Lent: the old Germanic word for spring-time. Our hearts are bidden to imitate the snow-drops: to come up from the darkness, raise themselves into the sunlight, and then fill the world with gladness.Parishioners from Ardrishaig, Christ Church, Lochgilphead and Glassary are joining together this Lent to read a poem a day through the  days of Lent and then Easter week. The poems have been chosen are in a beautul book, entitled The Heart’s Time, by Janet Morley. The poems come from across the English-speaking world, over the last four centuries. One poem is set for each day, accompanied by a short explanation, a reflection, and a brief suggestion for our own thinking.Parishioners will be reading the poems at home for those who wish it there will be meetings to share thoughts and inspiration at Ardrishaig Church during the weeks of Lent and at Christ Church on Sundays. Other meetings could be arranged, formally or informally.You can order the book from Fr Simon Mackenzie by emailing dr.lachlan@zen or calling  , or directly from Argyll Book Centre.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency glasgow prestwick airport cessna","story":"NewsEmergency at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as Cessna plane overshoots runway after engine failureThe incident saw a Cessna  overshoot the runway following the loss of engine power.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn emergency was declared at Prestwick Airport this afternoon after a light aircraft overshot the runway.

General manager Linda Lawson will pay tribute to  staff, who are all losing their jobs. And absolutely everything that could earn a pound was sold – including old mannequins , fashion stands and even store room shelving. The massive clear-out included giving away box loads of coat hangers. The building closes after  years of trading after current multi-millionaire owners the Jebreel family pulled the rug. As stock was snapped up in the sale, staff turned to fixtures and fittings to sell. Eight mannequins at pound each were snapped up - and some will remain gracing town windows.

The pound million screw will be positioned right on the old mill weir on the River Ayr opposite Ayrshire College. The weir originally drove an old cornmill on the site. Now tens of thousands of pounds a year will be generated by the flow of the river. Updated plans are now being considered by South Ayrshire Council, which is behind the scheme through the local Energy Agency. They show a single archimedes screw turbine at the old Nethermills Weir. Consultants Mann Power Hydro say: “Completion of this project will create a supply of renewable energy into the local distribution network, proposing firstly to sell the majority of output locally to meet the electricity demands of Ayrshire College, where the grid connection will be made. “In mitigation, the project includes a historic improvement to the passage of eels, lampreys and salmon smolts at the weir by the provision of new specialised passes for these species, and also improves upstream and downstream migration for salmon and other fish species. “It will moderate the flows into the existing passes in some conditions, which will make these less challenging. “This will help ameliorate a general problem whereby a weir is a barrier to migration of fish.” It is predicted the turbine - more than  feet in diameter and  feet long - will generate up to  kilowatts per year. The blade will turn at a maximum  revolutions per minute The Energy Agency carried out a study last year to estimate the energy potential passing over the weirs at Nethermills. It is expected the council will pocket pound, a year from selling the power and the scheme would receive a pound, feed-in-tarf. The single four-bladed screw is enough to power  homes. A report said: “With proper maintenance the scheme should continue to generate clean power for many decades after its capital cost has been repaid. “The scheme would provide an eye-catching and interesting landmark in the middle of the town, an emblem of the community’s dedication to the principle of sustainable development.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still in the planning stage and the organisers are currently raising money to hold the celebrations around the Borders and in Stirling.They are currently applying to ious sources for a six-figure sum to honour the literary great.If you would like to get involved or find out any more information, then contact Dr Adrian Hunter at adrian.hunter@stir.ac.uk or EYCDC Vicky Davidson at vicky@ettrickandyarrow.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"glendinning-gets-fizzy-with-touring-science-show","story":"MINI scientists from Glendinning Primary School grabbed their safety goggles last week to make their own fizzing potions.Primary one to three pupils got an introduction into chemistry when Generation Science visited their school on Thursday.They took part in the Get Fizzy workshop and served up some mysterious mixtures.Generation Science is a touring programme of fun science shows for younger children.And is delivered by Edinburgh Science, the international educational charity who aim to deliver the wonder of science to people around the world.The workshop was sponsored by EDF Renewables who are supporting a iety of Generation Science events across Scotland.Leanne Watson of EDF Renewables said: ldquoWe are proud to support Generation Science.ldquoThese fun and interactive workshops are an engaging way to encourage a new generation of scientists, who will be at the forefront of developing renewable energy and new technologies.Get Fizzy is a chemistry workshop for beginners where pupils learn about solids, liquids, gases and fizzes and how they can react.Acting Head Teacher of Glendinning Primary School, Nichola McCall, told us: ldquoWe were delighted to welcome the Generation Science tour to the school.ldquoGet Fizzy is a hands-on workshop that makes science fun and enjoyable.\"For some of our pupils, it was very exciting as it was their first ever introduction to chemistry.Over the last  years Generation Science has reached over one million pupils in Scotland.This year the tour will visit over  schools in  local authority areas from the Borders to the Shetland Isles.Get Fizzy is one of  educational shows and workshops provided by Generation Science and powered by EDF Energy.They are designed to make science exciting and easy to understand to help teachers cover the school science curriculum."},{"url":null,"title":"mp-mundell-muscles-up-ahead-of-brexit","story":"TWEEDALE MP David Mundell is muscling up ahead of the final Brexit battles in Parliament.The Scottish Secretary landed a one-hour training session recently during a silent auction at the Eastgate Theatre in Peebles.And this week Mr Mundell pulled on his trainers for the session with Gillian Wrigley of The Health Rooms studios and treatment centre.The -year-old believes the initial pilates and general fitness hour was beneficial.He told us: \"Despite the time pressures of politics, Ive been considering setting a little time aside to improve my physical fitness.\"Thats why I was delighted when the opportunity came along for some tuition from an expert like Gillian, who was a brilliant coach.\"As well as having a reputation for easing some aches and pains, it is also becoming increasingly popular as a general form of exercise.\"Mr Mundell, who also enjoys cycling, quipped: \"I hope my fitness pledge to myself is easier to deliver than Brexit.\"Gillian, who runs The Health Rooms with husband Stephen, offers a range of services including physiotherapy, sports injury massage and podiatry.She said: \"David was an enthusiastic and attentive student, who appreciates the benefits of exercise.\"I wish him well with his training and hope to see him back again soon.\""},{"url":null,"title":"google guitarist in tune for oaps","story":"Last Saturday afternoon Arran joined his uncle, Alex McAllister and many other volunteers, giving up their spare time, to make sure the Campbeltown Community Council senior citizens party went with a bang.Two other volunteers# service is recognised on page three.  Stuart Crossan fully deserves his Glasgow Sports Volunteer of the Year award.Mr Crossan gives up hours of his free-time to ensure the footballing youngsters of Pollock United have the best experience possible.On Monday Kintyre Wheelers Cycling Club met to discuss its first ever End of the World event just three months away.In early March, its secretary will spend a weekend voluntarily at the Scottish Outdoor Pursuits show.Organiser Robbie Semple, an army reservist sergeant and his committee have been pulling the national level event together for two months..Semple competed in the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy motorcycle races as a sidecar passenger.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

whose \"constructive ambiguity\" on Brexit has long frustrated those in his party who back a so-called Peoples Vote and played a part in the defection of eight MPs to the new Independent Group last week.Labours annual conference voted to keep a second referendum on the table, but made clear that the partys priority was an early election to allow it to implement its Brexit plan for a customs union with a UK say, close ties with the single market and dynamic alignment with EU workplace and environmental regulations.Read more:Brexit vote explained: What MPs are voting on and what amendments meanSpeaking to MPs on Monday, Mr Corbyn said that Labour would put forward its plans in an amendment to the Governments Brexit motion, but was also committed to \"putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country\".A briefing note to Labour MPs made clear the party would back the inclusion of Remaining in the EU on the ballot paper, as an alternative to a \"credible Leave option\", but would not back no-deal being a choice on offer.Mr Corbyn failed to back a referendum amendment tabled by Independent Group MP Anna Soubry, which was not selected for debate on Wednesday by Speaker John Bercow.But anti-Brexit campaigners will hope that he will now give his full support to the Peoples Vote cause.Speaking ahead of the vote, a Labour spokesman sidestepped questions on when the party would back a second referendumtheir amendment was amended.The spokesman said: \"We support a public vote in order to prevent no-deal or a damaging Tory Brexit. Our focus is on our credible alternative plan.\"Mr Corbyns plan was supported in Wednesday nights vote by Conservative former chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson.

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said his removal \"prolongs the anxiety and uncertainty that over five million people have faced for two and a half years\".A cross-party amendment designed to give Parliament the power to force a vote on extending Article  was pulled, after its tablers - Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman and Labours Jack Dromey - received assurances that Mrs Mays plan would have the same effect.In a joint statement, they said: \"The Government has just confirmed acceptance of all the proposals in our amendments. There will not now be a no-deal Brexit In  days time because there is not a majority in the House for crashing out without a deal.\"We will not plunge over the clf on March  into an abyss, making the country poorer in every sense of the word. There will now be an extension of the Brexit deadline to allow for serious cross-party dialogue on a better deal to protect the British national interest.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9491626.jpg?type=article-full","title":"the-penny-drops-the-public-toilets-in-scotland-saved-by-plan-to-turn-them-into-tourist-info-centres","story":"Some  public conveniences had faced the axe across Moray to save pound, - having already lost  in the past six years. With Scotlands  local authorities under pressure to save every penny there have been new concerns that councils, which are not legally required to provide toilets, are increasingly looking to offload the responsibility for them or close them to cut costs.Last month, a Herald study found that as of September, one in three of Scotlandrsquos remaining public toilets face being sold off or closed as councils battle to balance the books, sparking calls for them to become a human right.Now Aberdeen is currently considering shutting all ten of its public conveniences to save pound, and Highland, another tourism-leaning area, has  of its  public toilets, the most in Scotland, but have cut  in the past five years, and have five more facing the possible axe with a further  under scrutiny with plans for either partnerships or estment.In Moray, councillors and tourist chiefs have come up with a novel way to save their public toilets from the axe.An amendment supported by councillors yesterday suggests that the the toilets should remain open and under the control of the council for another year as discussions take place over whether to turn them into tourism hotspots, providing visitors with wi-fi and screens offering local information.Speyside Glenlivet councillor Derek Ross said the stay of execution will allow for a plan to be put in place to work out how the toilets can be used, and who will own them in the future.\"I am pleased the councillors accepted the amendment, sotoilets are safe for the time being.One of the jewels in the Moray crown: Cullen\"I wanted to have them kept open go give communities time to put in place initiatives to keep the toilets open, to consult with them and look at a iety of funding sources.\"We are keeping them open for another year. I would prefer to keep them open, full stop, because it is one of the services that councils should provide. But the way things are going, councils are looking to save money wherever they can.\"Moray Speyside Tourism and The Joint Community Councils of Moray can offer expertise and advice, and work collaboratively with communities to try and help them out and they would then be independent of the council.\"The popularity of TV series Outlander has been credited with bringing overseas tourists to Scotland with whisky and the coastline proving to be Morayrsquos biggest draws.Jobs supported by the tourism industry across the area are now nearing , as visitors spend almost .million nights a year in the region enjoying the sights Laurie Piper, managing director of Moray Speyside Tourism, believes the toilets in the region could be kept through ersication.Mr Ross said transforming the the toilets into tourism information areas would be a ldquogreat idea.\"They could be use to help point visitors in the direction of tourist attractions in the area,\" said Mr Ross. \"Tourism is valuable to the area and toilets play an important part in the infrastructure that underpins that industry. \"I say the ideas that Laurie is putting should be given a chance.\"Mr Piper said: ldquoI think we should look together at creative ways to create a solution and offer a sustainable  for the operation of those facilities.ldquoI would be keen to work with the council and the JCC to create a long-term sustainable future for the toilets for the benefit of the tourism business although this is reliant on the tourism BID projected to be approved.ldquoIt would take two or three years to put together. Money and time would be needed.Herald research showed that as of September there were  council-run public toilets around Scotland -  fewer than in .And  further free conveniences had their futures under question either because local authorities are looking to offload them through new ownership or they are up for closure.Pressure group the British Toilet Association which fears those under review could also end up disappearing has called for public toilets to become a human right enshrined in law and want legislation that forces councils to provide enough facilities for the elderly, disabled people or tourists."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-brexiteers-defy-may-over-vote-to-extend-article-50-process-to-delay-exit-day","story":"In a series of Commons votes, an amendment tabled by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper, which underscored the Prime Ministerrsquos promise, saw  members of the anti-EU European Research Group vote against it while only  Tories of the partys  MPs, eligible to vote, gave it their support.Labourrsquos own plan for a permanent customs union with the EU was again defeated by  votes to , a majority of .While Labour MPs called for the party leadership to now swing ldquowholeheartedly behind a Peoplersquos Vote, Jeremy Corbyn said he would continue to push for a version of his Brexit plan despite the signicant rejection by MPs.Meanwhile, David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, stressed the Commons had \"endorsed the PMs approach\" to have a series of votes next month and he stressed the best way to \"avoid a no-deal outcome\" was to vote for Mrs Mays deal in the next meaningful parliamentary vote."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-debate-night-making-sense-of-the-news-or-just-a-snooze","story":"Particularly so after it emerged the man at the centre of the row, failed UKIP candidate Billy Mitchell, had not just appeared on Question Time four times, in breach of the showrsquos rules, but he had also taken part in a pilot for Debate Night.Five hurdles for new BBC channelWith Mr Mitchell seemingly able to do a Paul McKenna on researchers, it was not impossible that he would turn up again last night when the show made its official debut.Debate Night producers were on the case, however. As a look at the audience application form showed, the love grandchild of Senator Joseph McCarthy and a top Stasi agent is now in charge of selection.

As a frequent stand-in host on BBC Radio Scotland morning shout-fest, Call Kaye, you could see why he had been given the gig.Magic or mince  You decideDebate Night made the news before last night when it emerged the budget for the show was so small it could not afford to move around the country, like QT. Whatever they have spent the money on, it is not the set. With its purple chairs and faux art it looked like the business class lounge of a cheapo airline. The audience were in cinema-style banked seating which made the audience look tiny. Worse, some of the seats were empty.But never mind the standard of the seating, what about the quality of the debate  The audience, Jardine informed us, came from all across Scotland, ldquofrom Ayrshire to Paisley, Perth and Edinburgh. In other words, from a bus ride away.On the  were three politicians, Deputy FM John Swinney, Labourrsquos Monica Lennon, and Murdo Fraser for the Scottish Conservatives, and two civilians, the poet Jenny Lindsay and the entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter. Two women to three men, or two to fouryou count Jardine: some things never change. No Greens or LibDems will it be their turn next week Marks out of  for The Nine The job of the new show, Jardine said in his introduction, was not just to get answers from politicians but to raise the standard of debate, no less. Within a minute, however, Murdo Fraser was talking over Monica Lennon and she was raising her own voice in response. So much for new standards of discourse. It was not long, either, before the politicians on the  began answering the questions that suited them rather than the ones they had been asked. Jardine pulled a Paxman now and then, possibly to shake himself awake. ldquoWhat does any of this mean, what are you going to do about it  he asked Lennon at one point.Half an hour was spent on Brexit, far too long. The next questions, on sectarianism and a possible teachersrsquo pay strike, were not matters that would have been raised on a QT from London, so in that respect Debate Night showed its worth, evennothing new emerged in the discussion.I would like to say the hour was packed with penetrating questions and illuminating answers, a show that showed QT how such programmes should be done. There were one or two moments worth catching, most of them coming from plain-speaking Sir Tom Hunter, but by and large this was a punishing watch, not least because of the late slot. An .pm finish, on a school night  Why bother committing to a serious programmeit doesnrsquot have a credible chance of building an audience By the time Jardine said goodnight it was time for this Cinderella to head to bed.

There has been no risk assessment for the people who have to travel to Raigmore to have their babies.\"There has never been a problem with care at Caithness General or Raigmore, but mothers here should get the same kind of access to treatment as they get in the cities and we used to have here.

The new software — which can be used on desktops and mobile browsers — allows website visitors to customise what they see and hear, from changing the contrast settings, language, font size and more.In the UK, there are estimated to be . million people with a learning disability and . million people who have English as a second language. ‘Recite Me’ has the ability to translate the NorthLink Ferries website into more than  languages — including Scots Gaelic . It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us. We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupThursday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible. Savings have to be made, but sticking rigidly to a timetable leaves little time to form development groups.Thursday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery.

Cross-breeding with pet and feral cats has been cited as the key threat to their natural survival. It is thought hybridisation began to affect the species severely between the s and s, driven by decreasing food sources, road kill and persecution by humans.Scottish Wildcat Action , a national conservation scheme, was set up in  in a last-ditch bid to rescue the species from the brink.However, it’s now thought previous estimates of the number of pure-bred wildcats remaining in the wild were way too high.Dr Andrew Kitchener, principal curator of vertebrates at National Museums Scotland and chair of the SWA steering group, said: “We now have the strongest and most reliable evidence to date that wildcats are in a more endangered state than previously understood. “While we believe there are wildcats remaining in the wild in Scotland, there are no longer enough to ensure their continued survival as viable populations. “We can now plan the essential next steps to give the wildcat a sustainable future.”Environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham has said no stone will be left unturned in the quest to save the nation’s only native feline.“The wildcat is an iconic Scottish species and as such I will consider every possible action the Scottish Government can take to save it, including an increased focus on captive breeding and reinforcement of the Scottish population with wildcats from where,” she said. “We have in place a partnership of scientists and specialists with the knowledge and expertise to give us the best chance of restoring the Highland Tiger as a distinctive and charismatic species in the Scottish countryside.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit sacked scottish mp says eu citizens used as bargaining chip","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...An MP sacked as parliamentary aide to the Scottish Secretary accused the UK Government of using EU citizens in the UK as a #bargaining chip# over the past two and a half years.Alberto Costa was forced as Parliamentary Private Secretaryto David Mundell after lodging an amendment calling for the UK to seek agreement with Brussels on citizens rights even in a no-deal - even though his proposal was accepted by ministers.Addressing MPs after losing his job in government, Mr Costa said it was a “very sad state of affairs” that his amendment was needed, and said the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons living in the EU “should never have been used as a bargaining chip”.The amendment passed without a vote last night, with the government avoiding likely defeat after more than  MPs from all parties said they backed it.Born in Scotland to Italian parents who have lived in the UK for decades without claiming British citizenship, Mr Costa has sought firm guarantees for EU citizens in all Brexit outcomes since the referendum in .

Another source confirmed that Mr Costa had been “sacked”.It sparked anger in the Scotland Office and many Tory MPs, with whom Mr Costa is a popular figure.

At Holyrood, the Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser called the sacking “hard to understand” and said Mr Costa “should be rewarded not punished”.Mr Costa met with Theresa May following his resignation, and her spokespeople stressed the Prime Minister’s “deep admiration” for his work.There had been confusion earlier in the day when Home Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that he saw “nothing” wrong with the amendment, only for SNP MP Stuart McDonald to point out the Prime Minister had suggested it was legally unworkable the day before.Mr Costa told the Commons that citizens’ rights “should never have been used as a bargaining chip during the negotiations for our withdrawal from the EU. That such rights were placed on the table in the first place was wrong.” Rights should have been ‘ring fenced’ in negotiations “at the outset”, Mr Costa added.Mr McDonald said it was “shameful, and deeply ironic, that the first time someone in the Scotland Office actually does their job... they are swtly given the sack”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn referendum pressure after labour s brexit plan defeated","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Campaigners for a second EU referendum have said Jeremy Corbyn must now swing fully behind a so-called People#s Vote after Labour#s alternative Brexit plan was defeated in the Commons.In a set of votes on Brexit amendments, the Labour Party’s proposal for a Brexit deal based on a customs union with the EU was defeated by  votes to .The vote prompted Labour MPs in favour of a fresh EU vote to call for an immediate change in focus by the party’s front bench.However, in a sign of continued resistance to a People’s Vote from some of Mr Corbyn’s allies, the shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon claimed that “given parliament looks set to extend Article , there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal”.MPs also rejected an SNP amendment ruling out a no deal Brexit under any circumstances by  votes to , undermining a previous decision to rule out leaving the EU without an agreement.An amendment from the Labour MP Yvette Cooper seeking to hold the Prime Minister to her commitment to allow a vote on delaying Brexither deal is defeated again in two weeks’ time was passed by a wide -vote margin.In a warning for the government,  Tory MPs voted against a three-line whip in favour of the amendment allowing a vote on extending Article , and another  abstained, pointing to the continued resolve of Tory Brexiteers.Responding to the defeat of Labour’s Brexit plan, Alison McGovern MP, a leading supporter of People’s Vote, said: “There wasn’t a majority for the Prime Minister’s deal and the Conservatives won’t support Labour’s alternative Brexit.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year.

It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

The First Responders received its first donation on February . Braid Valley Vintage Enthusiasts presented the Scheme with a cheque for pound, for the purchase of two defibrillators and response packs.John Crothers presented the cheque to Stephen Lamont and Alan Murray, two of the team working to get the scheme operational by early summer. Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas. This generous donation will be of great help to us in achieving our aim.”Stephen Lamont issued an appeal for local residents to ensure that their addresses were identiable.“Clear signage is vitalwe are to get to you quickly in a le threatening emergency. “Our plea is that you identy your house number or name clearly so that it can be read from the road. “ If you live up a shared drive, please talk to your neighbours and label the end of the drive with all the house numbers and ensure that each inidual house is numbered. “This will help us to help youyou are having an emergency.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.Last call for entries as Northern Ireland Tourism Awards head to Armagh for  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care. He was completely oblivious. You don’t go to a supermarket to watch other people use it as a toilet. You would expect most children to be potty trained by the age of two,” said the judge.She then gave the defendant the chance to come up with the money before the end of the court.Later Mr Lannon ed with the full restitution of £..For each of the offences Chestnut was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years.Describing his behaviour as ‘absolutely disgraceful’ Judge Kelly warned the defendantshe ever saw him again for anything similar he was going to prison.At the same court Chestnut also pleaded guilty to driving without insurance on August  last year on the Lake Road in Craigavon.For this offence he was given three months in custody, suspended for two years, and banned from driving for  months.Judge Kelly also ordered forfeiture of the car he was driving."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"credit where credits due as rosaleen travels afar","story":"LOCATED in West Africa and with a population of over two million people, there are over , credit union members in The Gambia.Poverty rates are very high with over  per cent of the population living on less than € a day.For over  years the Irish League of Credit UnionsFoundation has been providing financial and technical support to the National Association of Cooperatives and Credit Unions , the representative body for all the credit unions in The Gambia.The work of the ILCU Foundation in The Gambia to ensure strong, secure and sustainable credit unions throughout the country would not be possible without the support of credit unions across the world, including that of the local Newington Credit Union.Newington Credit Union Manager Rosaleen Bradley has just ed home after travelling to the African country to help credit unions in the spirit of ‘cooperation among cooperatives’.Now in her second year of volunteering, Rosaleen participated in the ILCU Foundation Volunteer Coaching Programme, to help with the development of credit unions in The Gambia.Rosaleen undertook a two-week volunteering programme to share her expertise, knowledge and skills with her credit union colleagues in The Gambia.She was accompanied by three other Irish credit union personnel – Alan Duff, Health Services Staff Credit Union Pauline Tourish, B#S Credit Union and Michael Byrne, Core Credit Union.During her time in The Gambia, Rosaleen and Michael worked together to visit a number of credit unions both in the capital Banjul and also in rural areas. They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school. When he comes back there will be another jeep sitting there or another car sitting there, sometimes marked sometimes unmarked.“This week he was going to get his child from a school event and they stopped him. He pleaded his case that he was running late to pick up his kids and the PSNI boot-boys told him he would stay as long as they ‘saw fit’.“A few weeks ago, I went to pick my son up and I was pulled over and the man said ‘are you in a hurry, Mr Kelly ’ I said I had to pick up my son and told him to get on with whatever he was doing. Again they said ‘you’ll be here as long as we want’. I was there for about ten minutes and I was late to pick up my son.“It’s not just political activists who experience what this brings, it’s also our families – our kids and our partners. Our partners are being intimidated. Two years ago I was approached by MI on the Grosvenor and they followed my partner as she was bringing my daughter to crèche.“The try to intimidate our family members when we’re not there. It’s clear that the ‘reformed’ police service, as they are called by those who work alongside them, are only accommodating to those who tow the line of the establishment. Those who stand in opposition to the British police force in Ireland are fair game, and that also extends to our families.”He continued: “It’s no coincidence that this attempt at criminalising the republican socialist movement, it is starting to rise again when our party is starting to grow and we are doing fantastic work in Belfast.“It will fail today as it has done over the  years of the existence of our party.

This is about their future as much as it is about ours.”Sinn Féin National Chairperson Declan Kearney MLA welcomed the launch of the initiative.#In October  I spoke at an event organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions where I made a direct appeal to the Labour movement to engage in the discussion on Irish Unity and to put it#s mark on this debate,” he said.#In the intervening months, the focus on reunicationhas intensied with more and more citizens engaging in conversations about future constitutional change in our country.#At the end of January this year,  citizens packed the Waterfront Hall to engage in a conversation about the future of Ireland beyond Brexit.#That was another clear indication of the dynamic which now underpins the Irish unity debate.#It is crucial that any future constitutional change is influenced and shaped by the people, and that equality, social justice and citizens rights are at its core.#An opportunity is now opening up to reshape Ireland and Irish society for this and future generations.#The Labour movement in Ireland should be central to that process by asserting workers, citizens and democratic rights.#The Irish Congress of Trade Unions should bring the full weight of its resources and influence to this debate.#The Labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by asserting the primacy of economic democracy, and a rights-based society in a new Ireland.“That will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting calls for an Irish unity referendum, and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.“The Irish Labour movement should immediately set about introducing a progressive Labour agenda to the Irish unity debate, and to theunfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.

signicant additional costs for the Irish economy, which would have “immediately damaging consequences” for trade.“It is clear that a no-deal scenario would have very severe and immediate disruptive effects, which would permeate almost all areas of economic activity,” he said.Dr Cassidy appeared before an Irish parliamentary committee on Wednesday to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly

of IrelandFebruary , He told members of the Budgetary Oversight committee that there would still be “some positive growth” in output this year and next year, evena deal cannot be reached between the UK and the EU, but he said it would be lower than forecast at about %.In the event of an agreement being reached between the UK and the EU which resulted in free trade between the economies, Dr Cassidy told the committee: “The long-term impact on output would be .% lower than under a scenario where Brexit had not taken place and employment would be , persons fewer than under a no-Brexit scenario.But in the event of a no-deal scenario the “impact on output over the longer term is that output would be .% lower than under a no-Brexit scenario and about , fewer jobs”.Asked by Independent TD Tommy Broughan whether the Central Bank was being “too sanguine” about its scenarios, Dr Cassidy said that there was “inherent uncertainty” over the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.“We’re projecting that economic growth over the two years combined, rather than being something above %, would instead be something close to % so six percentage points [or] three-quarters of the growth taken off the economy  in the first two years, which is a major impact,” he said.“I would certainly hope that we’re not underplaying the extent of the estimate.”Dr Cassidy said the Central Bank’s estimates were “more adverse” than those projected by the Department of Finance for first year post-Brexit.In many respects the economy is just not preparedMark Cassidy, Central BankFacebookTwitterHe added that the UK’s withdrawal would be a “shock” that would permeate almost all areas of economic activity and that border regions and farming, agriculture and food producing sectors were most at risk of being disproportionately affected.“In many respects the economy is just not prepared,” he said.But he added that over time it was expected that the negative effects of Brexit on many sectors would eventually level off.“Much of the economy will begin to cover, hopefully finding new export markets.“There will be some positive reaction over time but that is not to downplay the overall seriousness of these effects,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"tory revolt over mays brexit delay offer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

He was well-known and much-loved in this city’s dance music circles and there is no doubt that Derry ravers who cut their teeth on the dancefloors of the North West would have styled it out to his uplting house music. In the days when the Troubles were still raging, Protestants and Catholics started to come together having found a dferent kind of religion in dance music and Hurley’s pulpit was the DJ box.Chris took the ‘Barn’ in Kelly’s, Portrush, where a meagre  or  punters turned up for his first ‘Club Night’ and, within weeks, transformed it into a heaving success with , dance music lovers from Derry and all over the North turning up every week to make it an unbridled success.The Point Inn just over the border in Quigley’s Point, Donegal, was another club – a place of the stuff of legends for Derry ravers – where they went in their droves while Chris stood smiling at the decks.Derry DJs, promoters, those with fond memories of their raving youth and those who continued to enjoy Chris’ music over the years, shared their shock, disbelief and sadness following the news of his death on February .Charlie Dillon, also known as DJ Bill-X, believes it is only fitting that Derry’s dance music community, of which Chris was a huge part, should pay tribute to the man who has been hailed a ‘pioneer’ and ‘legend’ of the Irish dance music scene.“I met Chris in the early s, I had been working in Kelly’s nightclub when I was a student in Portrush,” he said.“Chris had only started doing nights in the famous Barn - within a few weeks he was catapulted into playing packed houses and bringing guest DJs from all over the UK. Chris was one of the reasons I started to DJ myself. He was a very modest and witty fella, but he knew his music inside and out and stuck to the type of music that he wanted to play, he DJed all over Ireland and the UK. A few years ago we were very lucky to get into guest DJ at our re-rub nights.“Chris was a true pioneer and was the godfather of house in Northern Ireland and his legacy will live on. My thoughts and prayers are with the Hurley family and his little daughter, Scarlett.”Derry DJ, Paul Moran, better known in music circles as DJ Paul P, described Chris as an ‘innovator’ and a ‘legend’.“I first met Chris in  when I clamoured over the DJ box in Kelly’s to ask him to be our guest DJ at new night we were starting in the Point Inn,” he said.“Thankfully he agreed and the rest as they say is history. Our paths crossed many times over the intervening years. I will always remember Chris as an innovator, a DJ of principal who would not compromise his musical style to please the masses.“Chris set the bar high for all others that would follow. He was a real gentleman and a legend of Irish dance music. He will be sorely missed and his legacy will live long in the hearts of the thousands of people who were lucky enough to attend Kellys in the early days of the rave - a magical time made by Chris Hurley.”“He was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.”Another of the city’s home-grown talents, DJ Darren McMenamin said Chris was an inspiration to him and set him on the path to do what he truly loves.“Although I was into dance house music around the late s early s, it wasn’t until  and my first visit to Kelly’s, witnessing one of Chris Hurley’s now legendary all night DJ sets, that I even considered the thought of being a DJ,” he said.“Up on the Decks, top off, , people eating out of the palm of his hand...hanging on every tune! Everyone focused on him. I was instantly drawn into the scene.“After going week in, week out, for a few months, the Point Inn opened on Sundays with Chris at the helm. I was there the first night and didn’t take long to be over chatting to Chris about music and some general trainspotting on my behalf.“He was always generous with his time and knowledge and a true inspiration for me and many like me. After a couple of years raving I then went on to become a DJ myself and anytime I ran into Chris he always had time for chat and always showed me a lot of respect.“In more recent years we spoke a lot through Facebook and he invited me along to play at his Barn -year reunions in Sandino’s which was a real honour.“He was a gentleman and a true pioneer of the dance music scene and will be sorely missed.”Stephen Porter from Derry-based dance organisation Jika Jika, said Chris had the ability to unite people through his music: “We were very shocked and saddened to hear the news about Chris illness.“I was lucky to have got to know Chris over the years and he was always an inspirational figure to me and someone I looked up to greatly. His passion for music was infectious and his mannerisms would make you feel at ease.“His legacy is that of someone that brought a war-torn country together through music and firmly established dance music in NI. Deepest sympathies to all Chris friends and family.”While Ann Harley, Proprietor of Sandino’s, said: “Chris ran our Saturday nights for almost a year in . I had missed the Kelly’s Barn years, so didn’t realise at the time how well known and respected he was.“He put  per cent into every night he ran for us ,best DJs, classy posters and flyers, great attention to detail. Apart from that, from the start, he just fitted in and became a friend to a lot of us. Can’t believe we won’t see him again, as everyone says, a proper gentleman. RIP Chris.”‘Godfather of House’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPoignant tributes also came from those in the dance music community outside Derry. Not least from Chris’ dear friends.Mark Mc Dermott from Dungiven said he was honoured to have been his close friend: “To me, Chris Hurley was the epitome of a gentleman, kindness, the most great friend, and musician. Also the epitome of class but so humble at the same time. To know him well was a true honour. He was such an inspiration to me in all angles of le and he helped me in more ways than he will ever know. “Chris had talent to burn as a DJ from such a young age and was a pioneer in music, the first to create the house music dance scene in Ireland that will forever be remembered as the Love Years, aptly named as he not only bridged the religious ide at the time with music but he brought all the youth together. He was a living legend but his legend will forever live on in my heart, and the hearts of many.“Gone but never ever forgotten - the Godfather of House, but most importantly my dearest friend and brother in spirit.”Hector McLennan, a dance music promoter from Strabane who has passed the genes onto his own daughter, celebrated Ibiza club DJ, Loéca, paid a heartfelt tribute to ‘the Godfather of House’.“Chris Hurleys name is synonymous with the introduction, development and explosion of dance music in Ireland,” he said.“He has earned a permanent place in the history of our dance culture. He was Northern Irelands godfather of house. Im not saying that he was the only one, there were others who played their part, but he was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.“Chris had the tunes that every DJ wanted. Ive often been in situations with people in the music business and we would hear a tune. One of us would always say, \"That was a big Chris Hurley tune.\" Like DJs of his time, his message was spread through DJ Mix Tapes. What car didnt have a Chris Hurley tape back in the day “Over the last few years I enjoyed some great nights with Chris. We reminisced about the good old days and we hit it off because we were both excited about the current house music scene. Stand out moments include driving to Portrush after Sven Vath in Eglinton to hear Chris in Portrush with John Morrison on tow, a mad Paddys weekend in Portrush in  and of course having him as a guest in Sugar on a night co-promoted with Jika Jika. His love and passion for House Music had never faltered. He didnt want to re-live his success of the past but was still an innovator pushing out the barriers and seeking out those fresh new sounds.“I will always remember Chris for his love and passion for House Music. Chris Hurley, thank you for the memories.”\"He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music...he led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"Neal McClelland, DJ and Presenter at Downtown Radio and Cool FM, also paid his respects recognising how powerful Chris’ music was in turbulent times: “Chris was an innovator and total gentleman that loved the groove and helped shape the wave of rave that swept across our country and created the bridge between two religions that paved the path for the future through music.”Darren Drake, DJ and good friend, said: “Chris was a devoted father, a loving son, brother and uncle. Ever since our first meeting, in those halcyon days of the house music revolution of the early s, of which he was a true pioneer, Chris Hurley has been, and forever shall be, my inspiration and my friend.”Ray McLaughlin, also known as DJ X-Ray: “Chris paved the way for a whole new generation of DJs some of us wouldnt still be DJing todayit wasnt for his vision in the early s.”Glen Molly said he wished Chris could have been there for the th anniversary of the Barn: “The  years of the Barn was missing him,” he said, “I would really have loved him to have played it.”Timmy Stewart, a DJ from Belfast and close friend to Chris, said: “I loved the fact Chris was so upfront with his music.“We had heard Secret Knowledge’s ‘Sugar Daddy’ played on the Essential Selection one Friday night and he played a white label of it the very next night. I always felt privileged to be exposed to that level of cutting edge music especially at that age and time.”Col Hamilton, Promoter at Lush! Official , paid this tribute on behalf of the club where Chris first burst onto the scene: “We were saddened to hear the news of the passing of original Kelly’s resident DJ Chris Hurley.“Back in early  when Kelly’s Barn was a live band and rock venue, the late James Kelly let a young local lad start a Saturday ‘Club Night’, the rest, as they say, is history. Chris Hurley started with about  people on the first night and within six months was attracting thousands of clubbers from across the North and Donegal flocking to hear the latest UK European house music. To say he started a legacy would be only fair and Lush! would not be here  years later as one of the UK’s leading venues without Chriss original vision.“We would like to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to His Family circle and his young daughter. Until we meet again, old friend.”Liverpool DJ, Steve Vertigo, said a phone call in  from Chris went on to ‘open the door on a magical Northern Irish adventure that has rumbled on for  years’.\"When I met him we shared similar hairand were both bang in the middle of an incredible love affair with house music,\" he said.\"That first night waiting in the Barn for it to open with hundreds of people outside banging on the walls chanting Let us in!” like some sort of fantastic zombie survival film was only a hint of the craziness to come. That first booking turned into a friendship and many repeat visits hanging out for days after gigs in Portrush with Chris and Joanne. He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music. Always ready with a laugh and a plan and an appetite for good old-fashioned fun. He led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"In  I played one last time with him in the main room at Kelly’s, a reunion and a waypoint on a long journey that now feels so short. It brought back memories of beautul, messy hazy times in Portrush when we were all young and had no idea how big this dream of utopia would grow.\"Ill remember his smile and the way hed look you up and down, head tilted slightly back as hed work out whether you were talking rubbish and how he was going to wind you up. He was a romantic and a dreamer and the gods know we need more of those.\"My heartfelt sympathies to his loved ones, family and friends. He was one of the good ones. Rise in Power, Chris. Big Love.\"The Hurley family said that they have taken heart in the tremendous outpouring of love and sympathy since Chris’ death.In a statement they said: “We are finding it very hard to take in, we miss him so much - he was so special to each and every one of us.“As I said before Christopher was our hero what a fighter to the end - he always believed he was going to get better.“We as a family are so proud of what Christopher achieved through his music bringing everyone together. Tributes that have been made to Christopher are so special to us knowing how well he was thought of and showed us everyone thought the same as us...what a gentleman he was.”The late Chris was son to Joe and Margaret, loving father of Scarlett and the late Ava, brother of Joseph, Sharon and Rhonda, a loving brother-in-law and uncle and a legend in Irish dance music.PICTURED ABOVE: The late Chris Hurley whose passion for his music made him a favourite with dance music lovers in Derry and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"magee music diamonds pearl","story":"Pearl-Natasha Waungana Dohertywas born in Harare, Zimbabwe, where she lived until she was ten.

I had an amazing time there the teachers were so supportive and Miss ODoherty in P.E taught me so many le lessons between reminding me to tie my shoelaces so I wouldnt trip again”.And…“I wasn’t musical in school I was told I was actually tone deaf which knocked my confidence for years and I didnt think about music until I went to university in Leeds.\"I always wrote poetry and stories, it was a way to escape the noise of the world and create a safer world to be in and after I started putting the words to music they started coming to le and took on new energy. I met a producer in Leeds called Mike Brown and he helped me record my first two singles, ‘Autumn Sky’ and ‘Free’ ”.Then what ...\"These songs helped get me the opportunity to go back to Zimbabwe and there I ended up shooting the video for ‘Autumn Sky’, as well as collaborating with chart topping African artists including Dhadza D, Tehn Diamond and more.\"Im lucky that music allowed me to travel and Ive performed across Africa including Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa and more. Ive been home since  writing and recording since and last year saw me release my biggest single to date, ‘Moved On’ which got , streams in its first month on Spoty.\"I also played Stendhal Festival, Fringe Festival, as well as Foyle Maritime Festival, played live on the BBC and headlined my own show at the Nerve Centre. And it was the first time Id played at home with my full band which was awesome!\"I also was the vocalist and songwriter for the Peace Four project, Traditions Meet which saw me work on Irish tunes and jigs with a collection of cross community artists which was led by An Culturlann and Sid Peacock.What have you got lined up “I’m working with Rioghnach Connolly, Nerve Centres Artist in Residence on a collaborative song writing project. Im really excited to write with such a talented artist and I cant wait to see the results of this and on th April my new song Glory will be released on all online stores. Therell be a single launch gig, but more on that later. Before that, on rd April I’m playing the Ghostlight Sessions in Strabane with the full band. Later in the year I’ll be releasing ‘Lights On’, produced by Derrys own Ryan Vail and I just love the way he has pushed me on this song”. Nobody is saying that Ryan Vail is in any way pushy by the way.You’re the queen of self-promotion, is it hard work “Yes! Its so dficult. You have to be the fan, the manager and the singer. You have to believe that people need to listen to your music you have to make sure your quality of music is great and then you still need to perform the music perfectly.\"It can be a lot of pressure but you have so much control, and I like being in control. Its easier with the Internet and social media as you can reach a wider audience than ever before but you cant forget that you still need an audience who will leave their houses and watch you perform live\".She hasn’t been well lately and it may or may not have taken a lot out of her to respond to my interrogation but she did so kindly and finally informed me “my songs are all available on all online music stores and physical copies can be bought directly from me”.And now for something completely dferent….There has begun a series of lunchtime recitals in the Great Hall up in Magee andyou’re out on lunch and at a loose end then why not broaden your horizons with Suzanne Savage tomorrow at one.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp candidate calls decisive action universal credit","story":"SDLP Ballyarnett election candidate, Rory Farrell has called on the British Government to take “decisive action to protect working families” in the wake of a High Court ruling against the controversial Universal Credit benefits system.Judges in London recently ruled that the Department of Work and Pensions Minister had ‘wrongly interpreted regulations when calculating Universal Credit payments and that this had disadvantaged working families.Mr Farrell said: “Working families in Derry are losing out due to fundamental flaws in the Universal Credit system. The method used to calculate payments is unfair, reliant on employers reporting wages on time and can lead to massive rental debts.“Universal Credit replaced a host of benefits including Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit, and some families on the new benefit are beginning to witness its pitfalls. Working Tax Credit payments were based on expected earnings for the year, whereas Universal Credit payments are based on earnings reported to HMRC in the previous month.“Working in Colum Eastwood’s constituency office in Northside, we are contacted on a weekly basis by people receiving no Universal Credit payments due to inaccurate or late reporting of their wages to HMRC.“If wages are reported late then Universal Credit payments can be affected. It all comes down to the Assessment Period, the month long period preceding payment which is used to calculate entitlement to Universal Credit.“We’ve had countless incidents where employers have reported wages late which resulted in two monthly wages going into one Assessment Period, giving the impression of massive monthly earnings. This has led to no Universal Credit payment the following month.“The flip side is that there will then be a preceding Assessment Period with no wages reported which leads to an inflated Universal Credit payment. It all financially balances out over the two-month period but it makes it very dficult for families to budget.“But the critical and most worrying aspect is the impact on Housing Costs. Most people on Universal Credit get help with Housing Costs which goes directly to the landlord, the equivalent of the old Housing Benefit system.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“In a month where no wages are reported they get an inflated Universal Credit payment with Housing Costs paid directly to the landlord. In a month where two wages are reported, they get no Universal Credit payment and the landlord receives no rent.“The Universal Credit payments balance out over two months but the landlord only receives one months rent, leaving the claimant in rent arrears.“One real le example is where a young Derry mother’s employer reported wages ten days late and she now owes her landlord nearly £ in rent. Had the wages been reported on time, she would owe her landlord nothing.“The sad reality is thatyour employer reports your wages late to HMRC that it could cost you a months rent.“We’ve asked Universal Credit to recalculate monthly payments and Housing Costs based on the dates employees were actually paid, but theyve said the system doesnt allow for this.“The system must change. Entitlement to Universal Credit must be calculated on actual monthly income, not calculated on when it was reported to HMRC.”“The SDLP voted against all aspects of Welfare Reform. Universal Credit is wreaking havoc on our society and it should be scrapped. In the absence of that, the British Government must take decisive action to make it fairer system for all.”CAPTION: SDLP candidate Rory Farrell."},{"url":null,"title":"singer niamh mcglinchey perform walled city market","story":"Those attending this weekend’s Walled City Market are in for a musical treat as rising country star Niamh McGlinchey will be performing live at the event.The Market s to Guildhall Square this Saturday March nd from am-pm and Niamh will be performing on the day from pm-pm.The popular food and craft market is organised by Derry City and Strabane District Council and takes place on the first Saturday of the month every month.The market offers a wide range of speciality food traders with fresh breads, vegetables, meat, homemade jams and preserves as well as handcrafted products such as textiles and paintings.Nicolle Walters, Market Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council said she was pleased to be offering musical entertainment along with the usual offering of some of the finest locally produced food and craft products.“We are delighted to be able to add to the atmosphere in Guildhall Square with a live performance from Niamh McGlinchey who is one of the most in demand country performers on the circuit.“The stalls open from am to pm and offer a wide range of top quality fresh produce at affordable prices.“We also have street food and a wide range of locally produced craft products for sale soyou are out and about on Saturday make sure and come along.”Hailing from Gulladuff in County Derry, Niamh started her days as a folk singer and earned an All Ireland medal in solo singing.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshShe has made a number of high profile appearances including singing the anthem at Croke Park and appearing on RTE’s All Ireland Talent Show and TG’s Glor Tire and Opry Le Daniel,She has spent the last six years touring the UK, Ireland and America alongside artists such as Nathan Carter, Derek Ryan, Bagatelle and the Irish Dance Spectacular “TitanicDance.”Later in March she will be performing in the renowned Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, so be sure to pop by and enjoy this songbird’s performance before she take’s flight.Among the traders at the Walled City Market will be well known local company Doherty’s Meats who will be serving a selection of their award winning street food including beef burgers, hot dogs and Derry Stew made with their Special Mince.Other traders at Saturday’s Market will be: Windy City Baking Company, Granny Knitter, CM’s Pantry, Living Crystal, Willow Studios, Curry Sauce NI, Amara Dexter Cattle, Crepes N Coffee, Watercolours By Noeleen, Keltic Slates, Rainbow Tie-Dye, No  Creations, Doorish Art  Crafts, Bake N Joy, Coffee  Cream, So Skincare and Simply Irresistible, La Tia Juanas.Anyone interesting in finding out more about trading at the market are asked to contact Nicolle at [email#protected] or Tel:  .For further information visit www.derrystrabane Subsites Walled-City-Market Welcome.Find us on Facebook at www.facebook whatsonderrystrabane  or follow us on Twitter @Walledmarket."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wMlxcXC8yNjEzNTk1MFxcXC9Ccmlhbi1UaWVybmV5LW5ldy5wbmdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9jYWNoZS5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJmYWRkYzFmMTA2YjIzOTQ1NzFhYjIzYjBjZGZlNjNlNzdhNDE3M2EwIn0=/brian-tierney-new.png","title":"tierney welcomes buncrana road upgrade public information day","story":"The Department of Infrastructure is to hold another public information day on the proposed A Buncrana Road dualling scheme.The news has been welcomed by SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCllr Tierneysaid: “At a public meeting convened by the SDLP on th May , residents were able to air their concerns to engineers with regards to the proposed dualling of Buncrana Road and some of its impacts on the local community. “Officials from the Department and ARUP Consultants listened to concerns and undertook towith revised drawings aimed at addressing some of the issues raised.“We have continued to lobby with the Department for Infrastructure and are pleased that a date for another Public Information Day has been set for Tuesday th March, Da Vinci’s Hotel. “We are hopeful that residents’ concerns and suggestions will be reflected in the new plans.

It is not a satisfactory situation.Mr Billy McGivern, the Executiversquos area manager, admitted to councillors he was not happy with the situation in Ballynahinch and explained what had gone wrong with the Antrim Road site where  new homes were to have been built.ldquoWe did get planning permission for the site, he said. ldquoWe dug trial holes and the ground was satisfactory, but we were overtaken by discussions between the landowner and a private developer. The Housing Executive could not go through with a vesting order where a private developer is going ahead to build low cost housing.Mr McGivern promised that the Executive would press very strongly for sites in Ballynahinch and would be meeting with local planners in an attempt to come up with an answer.Ballynahinch councillor Mr Eddie McVeigh agreed there were problems obtaining sites, but he pointed out that the town was not scheduled for any new homes until - and he wanted other sites investigated as soon as possible.Cllr William Brown felt the now abandoned Antrim Road site was not all it was supposed to be anyway and it would have been foolish to proceed with a site which would have flooded, as it had done in the past.Cllr Francis Laverty wanted to know how the Executive could justy giving houses in Ballynahinch to people from Drumaness.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick firemen had another busy week, during which they attended several gorse fires and a chimney fire.On Saturday they were called to a gorse fire near Irish Street and the previous day they attended a Gorse Fire at Gallows Hill.On Thursday they were called out three times. The first was in the morning to St Johnrsquos Old Peoplersquos Home in Pound Lane, but they were not needed as the fire alarm had gone off accidentally.KILLOUGH mdash Killough Village Committee is pressing the Housing Executive to repair extensive storm damage caused to houses during the Christmas period.Damage caused to several of the new houses in the Castle Street area was one of the main problems discussed at a meeting of the committee recently.ldquoSerious storm damage to the roofs occurred, especially over the Christmas period, and this has not been fixed, the committee claims.ldquoLetters were sent to the Housing Executive and the contractor. The Executive sent a clerk of works to meet the contractorrsquos men at an arranged time, but they didnrsquot turn up, the committee said.ldquoThe occupants are very annoyed about this lack of interest and are now awaiting immediate action before dampness causes more serious damage.The committee has also hit out at the delay in truing to prove the ownership of the village harbour. They say it has ldquogone beyond a joke and intend sending a delegation to Down Council in a bid of finally resolve the ownership question.ldquoNothing can be done to start work on the sadly neglected harbour area until the present owner is contacted and public ownership is established. We firmly intend to pursue this matter until work has begun, the committee added.In the evening they attended a gorse fire on the Saul Road and several hours later they attended a chimney fire at Bobbie Hanveyrsquos photographic shop in Irish Street.ARDGLASS mdash Local planners have been asked to keep watch on a dredging operation currently underway at Ardglass harbour.The call has come from Down Council chairman Eddie McGrady, who is concerned not so much about the dredging but what is happening to the materials being taken from the harbour.Local councillor Dermot Curran is also concerned. He said that a tipping operation at the rear of the Seaview estate has not been properly maintained mdash much to the disgust of residents.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Three pupils from Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have won a Raleigh Boxer bicycle in a national lsquoWheels Projectrsquo open to Tufty Clubs.The bicycle, which will be used by the Tufty Club members at the school, was the top price in the - years section of the competition which was organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.Members of the schoolrsquos Tufty Club entered the competition, but it was the entries of Jason McKeown, Paul Beattie and Paul Chambers that clinched the top prize.COMBER mdash Comber police are investigating a number of thefts which took place in the town over the past week.Thieves entered the Rle Club in Railway Street and took away away a number of bottles of spirits on Wednesday evening.

We really are in need of fund raising from the public to help keep us going.Glebe House manager Diarmaid McGarrigle blames the rise in student overheads as one reason for the shortage of dedicated volunteers, calling it a ldquopoor indictment on our society.Mr McGarrigle said up until a few years ago Glebe House benefited from a ldquoteam of dedicated, driven and enthusiastic helpers.He said that is no longer the case because students were now having to seek paid employment to cover tuition fees and other costs.ldquoIt is a shame because young groups need volunteers from their own peer group to relate to, he explained.ldquoWe can offer volunteers a wide iety of skills to choose from as we have  acres of farm land, animals to look after and an environment to plan and maintain. We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal.

He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago.

He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK.

Pic by Victoria Jones PA WireMr Corbyn told Labour MPs on Monday that he was ready to support moves to demand a public vote “to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.Theresa May’s dramatic announcement on Tuesday that she would allow MPs to vote on delaying the UK’s EU withdrawal beyond March  took the sting out of an evening of Brext votes which had been expected to feature a number of ministerial resignations.Any Conservative bust-ups have now been delayed for up to two weeks, as Mrs May prepares to bring her Withdrawal Agreement back to the Commons for a “meaningful vote” on March .If she fails to overturn the -vote mauling the Agreement received in January, votes will be held on the following days on blocking a no-deal Brexit on March  and extending the two-year Article  negotiation process.Mrs May’s U-turn threw a spotlight on the Labour leader, whose “constructive ambiguity” on Brexit has long frustrated those in his party who back a so-called People’s Vote and played a part in the defection of eight MPs to the new Independent Group last week.Labour’s annual conference voted to keep a second referendum on the table, but made clear that the party’s priority was an early election to allow it to implement its Brexit plan for a customs union with a UK say, close ties with the single market and dynamic alignment with EU workplace and environmental regulations.Speaking to MPs on Monday, Mr Corbyn said that Labour would put forward its plans in an amendment to the Government’s Brexit motion, but was also committed to “putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.A briefing note to Labour MPs made clear the party would back the inclusion of Remaining in the EU on the ballot paper, as an alternative to a “credible Leave option”, but would not back no-deal being a choice on offer.Mr Corbyn failed to back a referendum amendment tabled by Independent Group MP Anna Soubry, which was not selected for debate on Wednesday by Speaker John Bercow.But anti-Brexit campaigners will hope that he will now give his full support to the People’s Vote cause.William and Kate show their pulling power at Belfasts Empire Music Hall Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy.

Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
