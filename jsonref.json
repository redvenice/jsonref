Women take memorial picture while spending an afternoon around the Persian Gulf Martyrs\u0027 Lake in Tehran, one not wearing the hijab or headscarfAn Associated Press reporter spotted about two dozen women in the streets without a hijab over the course of nine days, mainly in well-to-do areas of Tehran - a mall, a lakeside park, a hotel lobby.Many other women, while stopping short of outright defiance, opted for loosely draped colorful scarves that show as much hair as they cover. Even in Tehran\u0027s Grand Bazaar, frequented by many traditional women, most female shoppers wore these casual hijabs. Still, a sizeable minority of women was covered head-to-toe in black robes and tightly pulled headscarves, the so-called chador.       Iranian women take a selfie around of the Persian Gulf Martyrs lake, west of the capital TehranThe struggle against compulsory headscarves first made headlines in December 2017 when a woman climbed atop a utility box in Tehran\u0027s Revolution Street, waving her hijab on a stick. More than three dozen protesters have been detained since, including nine who are currently in detention, said Masih Alinejad, an Iranian activist who now lives in New York.Despite attempts to silence protesters, public debate has intensified, amplified by social media.Last month, a widely watched online video showed a security agent grab an unveiled teenage girl and violently push her into the back of a police car, prompting widespread criticism.       In this Saturday, July 6, 2019 photo, women walk on the shore of the Persian Gulf Martyrs\u0027 Lake in Tehran, Iran. President Hassan Rouhani and Iran\u0027s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have supported a softer attitude toward women who don\u0027t comply with the official dress code. However, hard-liners opposed to such easing have become more influential.They have called for harsh punishment, even lashes, arguing that allowing women to show their hair leads to moral decay and the disintegration of families. The judiciary recently urged Iranians to inform on women without hijabs by sending photos and videos to designated social media accounts.\u0027The more women dress in an openly sexual way, the less we\u0027ll have social peace, while facing a higher crime rate,\u0027 Minoo Aslani, head of the women\u0027s branch of the paramilitary Basij group, told a rally last week.       Reformist Iranian MP Parvaneh Salahshouri said coercion does not work to enforce compulsory headscarves for womenAnother gathering was attended by several thousand women in chadors. One held up a sign reading, \u0027The voluntary hijab is a plot by the enemy.\u0027Reformist lawmaker Parvaneh Salahshouri said coercion does not work. \u0027What we see is that the morality police have been a failure,\u0027 said Salahshouri, who wears a headscarf out of religious belief.Changing hijab rules through legislation is unlikely because of the constraints on parliament, she said.Instead, women should engage in non-violent civil disobedience, Salahshouri said. She cautioned that it\u0027s a slow, difficult road, but that \u0027Iranian women have not given up their efforts.\u0027The hijab controversy goes back to the mid-1930s when police forced women to take off their hijabs, part of a Westernization policy by then-Shah Reza Pahlavi. Under his son and successor, women could choose. Western apparel was common among the elite.       Iranian women wearing the chador, a tightly-bound head and neck scarf, attend a ceremony in support of the observance of the Islamic dress code for women in TehranA 2018 survey by a parliamentary research center indicates that most women wear a casual hijab and only 13 per cent opt for a chador.Attitudes have changed. In 1980, two-thirds believed women should wear hijabs. Today, fewer than 45 per cent approve of government intervention in the issue, the research said.Iran has seen waves of anti-government protests, including an outcry after a 2009 election many contended was stolen by hard-liners. Those with economic grievances frequently protest.Alinejad, the activist, argued the campaign against forced hijabs carries symbolic weight, saying that mandatory headscarves were \u0027the symbol that the Iranian government used to take the whole society hostage.\u0027In recent years, she has posted videos and photos of activists, including of women filming themselves as they walk in the streets without a headscarf. Alinejad said she receives more than 20 images a day, but posts only some.       Iranian women in contrasting styles of dress spend an afternoon around the Persian Gulf Martyrs\u0027 Lake in TehranThe activists in Iran take risks.In March, human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has represented female protesters, was sentenced to 38.5 years in prison, of which she must serve 12, according to her husband.In April, activists Yasaman Aryani, her mother Monireh Arabshahi and Mojgan Keshavarz were arrested after posting a video showing them without headscarves in the Tehran metro. In the video, they distributed flowers to female passengers and spoke of a day when women have the freedom to choose.Amnesty International said on Monday that Iranian authorities have used incommunicado detentions, prolonged solitary confinement and threats against family members to coerce detained activists to retract their opposition to forced veiling in video-taped \u0027confessions.\u0027 The group said it had detected such a pattern in six cases since April.       Two Iranian women take a selfie outside a shopping mall in northern Tehran.Some activists maneuver carefully.The 30-year-old fire-safety consultant said she tries to avoid policemen when she walks the streets without a hijab. She said she grudgingly complies with the dress code when she delivers lectures or sings in a mixed choir - activities she would otherwise be barred from.At the high-end Palladium Mall in northern Tehran, several shoppers casually ignored a sign reminding customers that the hijab is mandatory. One woman only pulled up her scarf, which was draped around her shoulders, when she stepped into an elevator and found herself next to a security guard.Nearby, 20-year-old Paniz Masoumi sat on the stone steps of a plaza. She had dyed some of her hair blue, but kept that funky patch hidden under a loose scarf.She said police recently impounded her car for two weeks, fining her amid claims that a traffic camera snapped her with a below-standard hijab.If hijabs were voluntary, she\u0027d throw off hers, Masoumi said.

She had a considerable reputation as a photographer but, in the years to come, it seems to me, we will cherish her still more warmly and regard her work even more highly. The black-and-white pictures from the 1930s and 40s – kids playing in the streets, old people keeping a watchful eye on the neighbourhood – have a lyrical grace and a rough-and-tumble tenderness. The kids are having a lot of fun – even if that fun involves someone getting hurt – and it’s fun looking at the pictures. They’re easy on the eye in the way that Anna Karenina is easy to read compared with Ulysses. Henri Cartier-Bresson was a decisive influence but Levitt seemed happy to survey the flow of life casually going about its unruly business rather than pouncing on instants of suddenly perfect visual geometry. Her photographic moments, as a result, contain entire childhoods, whole lifetimes of everyday disappointment and routine happiness: the kind of stuff we associate with narrative fiction rather than photographs.In the 1950s she began shooting in colour – not as a formal experiment but as a natural extension of the urge James Agee had observed in the earlier black-and-white work: “to perceive the aesthetic reality within the existing world”. When almost all of this colour work was stolen by a burglar she started afresh in 1971.This picture is part of a retrospective of Levitt’s work now on show at Arles photography festival. I like fondly to think that Levitt had photographed the lady in the marbled blue dress on the left before, Seven Up!-style, caught in a similar gesture of playful triumph – now that she’s old it might just be backache – when they were both young, in the 1930s. But the other woman, on the right, haven’t I seen her before too, at exactly the age she is now, looking on with that same attitude of rough-hewn, nosy resignation, in black-and-white pictures from before the war? There is, in other words, something timely and eternal about Levitt. So while her city has changed, has become, in many ways, a playground for the young and affluent, this picture also depicts a distinctively 21st-century scenario: Airbnb guests, with all their luggage, wondering when their host is going to show up. Help is, as they say, at hand it’s just that no one knows what form it might take.• Helen Levitt: Observing New York’s Streets is at Espace Van Gogh, Arles photography festival, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17e1bbfae1e5c637b33a576c3b6844bc3fc09ad7/0_286_4285_2570/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc8458700bc997a36bb7ded0330d935","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The running of the bulls in Pamplona, Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, the earthquake in California and the Tour de France – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc4611913e167184c439f0a9eec3c3f91a4220e/0_0_1563_2000/master/1563.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe5de1cbcba07917d0714d27ccffd369","title":"alan turing to feature on new 50 note","story":"Mathematician who cracked Enigma code was persecuted for his homosexuality in 1950sAlan Turing, the scientist known for helping crack the Enigma code during the second world war and pioneering the modern computer, has been chosen to appear on the new £50 note.The mathematician was selected from a list of almost 1,000 scientists in a decision that recognised both his role in fending off the threat of German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic and the impact of his postwar persecution for homosexuality.The announcement by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, completes the official rehabilitation of Turing, who played a pivotal role at the Bletchley Park code and cipher centre.William Shakespeare was the first historical character to appear on a Bank of England note in 1970. Here’s the full list of the historical characters that have appeared on banknotes issued by the central bank in England and Wales over the last five decades.1970 William Shakespeare, playwright (£20) 1971 Duke of Wellington, soldier and statesman (£5) 1975 Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing (£10) 1978 Sir Isaac Newton, physicist and mathematician (£1) 1981 Sir Christopher Wren, architect (£50) 1990 George Stephenson, engineer (£5) 1991 Michael Faraday, scientist (£20) 1992 Charles Dickens, author (£10) 1994 Sir John Houblon, first Bank of England governor (£50) 1999 Sir Edward Elgar, composer (£20) 2000 Charles Darwin, naturalist (£10)2002 Elizabeth Fry, prison reformer (£5)2007 Adam Smith, economist (£20)2011 Matthew Boulton and James Watt, steam engine industrialists (£50)2016 Winston Churchill, prime minister (£5)2017 Jane Austen, author (£10)While at Bletchley Park, Turing came up with ways to break German ciphers, including improvements to pre-second world war Polish methods for finding the settings for German Enigma machines.The Bank praised Turing for his role as a scientist and for the impact he has had on society. Prosecuted for homosexual acts in 1952, an inquest concluded his death from cyanide poisoning two years later was suicide.The Bank acknowledged Turing’s pivotal role in the development of early computers, first at the National Physical Laboratory and later at the University of Manchester.“He set the foundations for work on artificial intelligence by considering the question of whether machines could think,” the Bank said. “Turing was homosexual and was posthumously pardoned by the Queen, having been convicted of gross indecency for his relationship with a man. His legacy continues to have an impact on both science and society today.”Peter Tatchell, the veteran gay rights campaigner, said the £50 note announcement was a “much-deserved accolade for one of the greatest minds of the 20th century”.Turing’s face will appear on the new £50 polymer note when it goes into circulation in 2021, following a public consultation process designed to honour an eminent British scientist.The Bank said it had received a total of 227,299 nominations, covering 989 eligible characters. These were narrowed down to a shortlist of 12, with Carney making the final choice.The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, were Mary Anning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger, and Alan Turing.Speaking at the launch, Carney said the selection process for new notes was “as inclusive as possible.” However, MPs and campaigners had warned that choosing a white scientist risked sending a “damaging message that ethnic minorities are invisible” while on Monday the campaign group, Banknotes of Colour, said its 150,000-strong petition to have an ethnic minority on a banknote had “not been taken seriously” by the Bank.Asked by the  whether the new £50 note was a missed opportunity to reflect erse modern Britain, Carney said the Bank wanted to celebrate “all aspects of ersity” and that “to not represent the scale of scientific achievement in this country would be a mistake”.He added: “We want to represent as best as possible all aspects of ersity within the country, from race, religion, creed, sexual orientation, disability and beyond. What we have today is a celebration of one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists in the United Kingdom and not just this country’s history but world history.”The note was unveiled at Manchester’s Museum of Science and Industry, a short walk from the Manchester University building where Turing helped develop programming for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.A new exhibition at the museum showcases several artefacts connected to the pioneering scientist, including an original Enigma cipher machine used in the second world war, electronic components for a Ferranti Mark 1 computer and a Manchester University marketing brochure from 1951 with a photograph of Turing leaning over a computer.It was also in Manchester where the campaign to clear Turing’s name began. The original petition calling for a posthumous pardon was begun by William Jones, a computer scientist living in the city, and eventually reached 37,000 signatures, prompting Turin’s royal pardon in December 2013.John Leech, the former Liberal Democrat MP for Manchester Withington who helped lead the campaign for a Turing law, said he was “very emotional” to see the new £50 note at the official unveiling and that it was a “massive acknowledgement of his mistreatment and unprecedented contribution to society”.Leech said: “It is almost impossible to put into words the difference that Alan Turing made to society, but perhaps the most poignant example is that his work is estimated to have shortened the war by four years and saved up to 21 million lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d601dbf8877adb1fc1a9fb5a4fa3ae9e5c2a1f33/10_208_3466_2080/master/3466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c495018f537926fc9f47aff44ee8b23b","title":"boeing 737 max ordered by ryanair undergoes name change","story":"Decision fuels speculation that troubled plane will be rebranded once it is given all clear to flyA Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair has had the name Max dropped from the livery, further fuelling speculation that the manufacturer and airlines will seek to rebrand the troubled plane once it is given the all clear to fly again.Photos have emerged of a 737 Max in Ryanair colours outside Boeing’s manufacturing hub, with the designation 737-8200 – instead of 737 Max – on the nose. The 737-8200 is a type name for the aircraft that is used by aviation agencies.The Max aircraft remains grounded worldwide after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 people. Boeing has yet to convince regulators that software modifications are sufficient to ensure the plane’s safety.Ryanair has 135 of the 737 Max models on order, the first five of which are due for delivery in the autumn, once regulators have declared the plane safe. The airline’s fleet order is comprised entirely of a larger version of the Max 8, with 197 seats, which it has until now referred to in official Ryanair announcements as the 737 Max 200.Neither Ryanair nor Boeing has commented on nor confirmed the substitution of the 737-8200 for the better known Max, as seen on the photographs taken at Renton in Washington, US, and posted on social media by Woodys Aeroimages. In previous photos from the same source, new Ryanair 737 Max 200 planes from Boeing are shown with 737 Max on its nose.It is understood that what is painted on the plane is a matter for the airline rather than the manufacturer. According to sources reported in the Wall Street Journal, the Max plane is unlikely to return to the skies before 2020.Ryanair would not be the first airline to use a different formulation in referring to the plane. International Airlines Group, which owns carriers including British Airways and Aer Lingus, was equally coy when purchasing discounted Max planes from Boeing last month. Announcing the letter of intent signed at the Paris airshow, IAG referred to “200 B737 aircraft” that would join its fleet from 2023, which it described as “a mix of 737-8 and 737-10 aircraft”.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp e into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane\u0027s black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFlight ET302 crashes approximately six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it is recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.Plenty of observers – among them Donald Trump – have advised Boeing to rebrand the plane before its eventual return to service. The US president tweeted in April: “If I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, \u0026amp REBRAND the plane with a new name.”Boeing told reporters at the Paris show that it would consider changing the name to help the model return to the skies, although the company said it was not working on a name change in its most recent statement on the matter: “We remain open-minded to all input from customers and other stakeholders but have no plans at this time to change the name of the 737 Max.”The Max is Boeing’s top-selling aircraft, with about 5,000 ordered, although deliveries have ceased since the grounding in April and IAG’s is the only significant – and provisional – order.Investigations into the two disasters involving the 737 Max have highlighted the role played by anti-stall software that countermanded pilots’ commands as both planes crashed soon after takeoff. Airlines fear some passengers will refuse to fly on the Max.United Airlines, one of the main operators to date, has drawn up schedules without the 737 Max until November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a0602cc0cf06b1a03a90dadc656f178e3f78c24/0_157_4703_2822/master/4703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31740f2b780b0aeaada0d9903e876bd5","title":"invasion electric scooter backlash","story":"They’re cheaper than cabs, less effort than a bike and more convenient than buses. But as the number of e-scooter accidents rises, a backlash is growingMost of the people riding electric scooters around Copenhagen glide like swans, bodies motionless and serene with heads tilted into the sunshine.I am the ugly duckling, wobbling and jerking while I struggle to figure out exactly how this two-wheeled contraption works. Where do I put my feet? How hard do I thumb the accelerator? And how on earth am I meant to indicate left and press the brake with my left hand at the same time?It doesn’t take long to start gliding, even if I don’t feel very swanlike, or to notice that people in Denmark have found all sorts of less conventional ways to use e-scooters since they were introduced in January. Couple after couple perch together, heels of their feet barely balancing on the footplate. A traveller presses his suitcase between his knees while he crosses the junction near Tivoli Gardens. Two teenagers dart along the footpath outside the city’s central station, nipping between pedestrians.“I’ve seen a guy sitting on a suitcase using it as a scooter chair,” said Jesper Hemmingsen, a researcher at the Danish council for road safety, the RST. “I’ve seen parents delivering their children to school, a child standing at the front and their parents steering. It’s an easy way to get there, but it’s not a safe way. I’ve seen parents hire scooters for their kids to give them something to do. People treat them like toys. But they have no protection.”Over the past 18 months, it feels as though e-scooters have taken over many of the world’s cities. Scooter share firms have staked claims in more than 100 cities worldwide. Lime and Bird (from the US) and Voi, Circ, Flash and Tier (from Europe), are start-ups dripping with venture capital backing, attempting to create and carve up a market that is changing cityscapes everywhere.But piles of scooters discarded by the roadside, a worrying number of injuries and even some road deaths have provoked a growing backlash in some places.Those dangers were underscored recently when Emily Hartridge, a 35-year-old YouTuber and TV presenter, was killed while riding an e-scooter in Battersea, south-west London, after a collision with a lorry at a roundabout. Last month Paris – the e-scooter hub of Europe, with an estimated 20,000 trottinettes on the streets – saw its first fatality after a young man was hit by a truck.So are e-scooters a vital new part of modern, eco-friendly urban transport, or are they a risky and unnecessary fad, pushed by tech investors desperate to disrupt the status quo? And what can people in the UK, where the use of e-scooters remains illegal on both roads and pavements – despite the rise in models for sale in shops – learn from the experience of other European cities?Copenhagen, where e-scooters arrived nearly six months ago, is well-placed to answer this question. The police and road safety council are assessing the impact of the seven scooter firms and 7,000 scooters that have arrived since the Danish government introduced a trial period on 17 January.Pedestrians complain about scooters strewn across pavements and that they are a hazard for blind people and wheelchair users, as well as other anti-social behaviour: one young man rode an e-scooter through the aisles of a Netto supermarket in Odense seven times in one day.The city is flat, which helps, but more importantly there are miles and miles of wide roads with dedicated cycle lanes, usually raised and separated from car traffic with a kerb. No one has to compete for space. A scooter shouldn’t need to be anywhere near a lorry.But the road safety council is still worried about a growing number of injuries. “At the moment we have an assumption that it’s the same level of injuries for e-scooters as for cyclists,” Hemmingsen said, mentioning a recent study by two casualty departments in Copenhagen that found an average of about two injuries a day. About 800 cyclists a year are seriously injured.Copenhagen police are also acting. After running an information campaign, senior officers mounted an operation against drink-riders earlier this month, posting officers around the city centre.In one night last weekend, 24 e-scooter riders were stopped on suspicion of riding while over the legal alcohol limit, and four more for some form of narcotic intoxication, superintendent Allan Teddy Wadsworth-Hansen said. They face fines of up to 2,000 krone (£240).One of the motorcycle officers standing in Frederiksborggade, a main route into the heart of Copenhagen’s night life, stopped one rider and breathalysed him. Then a second arrived who had also been drinking. “While he’s still trying to process the first one, a third e-scooter turns up with two people on it,” Wadsworth-Hansen said. “When they see the police, they try to slow down. The woman on the back falls off – she wasn’t hurt seriously – and the driver turns out to be driving under the influence of alcohol. And then a fourth one approaches, and he has also been drinking.”Although there is sometimes a spike in the number of car drink-drivers over the summer, “you would never get four drivers in a row over the limit,” Wadsworth-Hansen said. “It doesn’t really bode well for e-scooters late in the evening, because drinking and driving is dangerous.”“Road users are used to seeing bicycles, but they’re not used to e-scooters. When you see someone standing up, arms by their sides, it’s easy at a glance to think they are a pedestrian and not realise they’re coming towards you at 20kmh,” he said.The experience of Parisians suggests that it’s not only e-scooter riders at risk. Isabelle van Brabant was hit by an e-scooter in the park at Les Halles in May, breaking her wrist in two places and causing a bone tear. For the pianist at the Paris Opera, it’s a professional disaster as well as a personal one. “She cannot play piano for one year, and piano is her life,” said her husband Jean-René Albertin. “When Isabelle was at the hospital, they said that each day 10 people come in for treatment. We think about 200 people a day are hurt.”They have set up a campaign group, Apacauvi, to win compensation for victims, with legal actions planned against the Paris municipal authorities and the rider who injured Van Brabant. “We have received 10,000 messages and we have about 850 people who want to participate in the association – people who have been hurt,” Albertin said.He wants the French government to force riders to take out insurance before they start riding, so that victims can be compensated from a central fund, even if an inidual rider cannot be identified.Paris’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, was in favour of e-scooters as a greener alternative to cars, but she has announced a crackdown on the “anarchic” dockless scooters. From this month, bad parking, riding on pavements and breaking the 20kmh speed limit will all result in fines. Police said they had issued 1,000 tickets and impounded 600 scooters.Albertin is unconvinced. “People just ignore the rules,” he said. But he is not in favour of an outright ban, as in the UK. “I don’t think making them illegal is right.”Britain remains a lacuna for the e-scooter share firms because, for at least the last 30 years, it has been against the law to ride them either on the road or the pavement. Electric scooters, like Segways, hoverboards, Go-Peds and self-propelled unicycles, are neither roadworthy enough under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to be registered as vehicles – complete with licence plate – nor can they be used on the pavement: an offence against the Highways Act 1835. People are occasionally prosecuted.Yet the e-scooter trade is flourishing. Halfords has 15 models available in the “kids zone” on its website. Argos has 23, also marketed as toys with designs from Trolls, Star Wars and Jurassic World. Ministers are in a bind, under pressure to liberalise or be left behind, while also wanting to enforce the law to prevent further tragedies like the one in Battersea.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told the Observer there was a “pressing need for the government to provide clarity and guidance” on e-scooters.In March, then transport minister Jesse Norman told the Observer he was considering licensing e-scooters, and his successor Michael Ellis is overseeing a review of legislation at the Department for Transport. But the government is also concerned about retailers flouting the law, and Ellis will hold a roundtable with Halfords, Lime, Bird and some manufacturers to urge them to tell consumers that they might be able to buy an e-scooter, but they can’t ride it in a public place.“We are examining whether they can be used safely on the road – and if so, how that should be regulated to ensure the public’s safety,” Ellis said. “However, companies must understand that reviewing laws does not necessarily mean laws will change. People who use e-scooters need to be aware it is currently illegal to ride them on the pavement and the road.”At night, the streets of Copenhagen are busy with e-scooters, and it’s easy to see why so many people have been stopped recently for drink-riding. You’re free to travel on a whim: it is cheaper and more immediate than cabs, far more convenient than buses or trains, and doesn’t require the effort of riding a bicycle.“It has completely ided people,” Hemmingsen said, as we walk round the meatpacking district. “Either people think they are the best thing ever or they are a scourge. I saw someone had put one in a rubbish bin. They dredged the harbour in March and they found 12, and scooters have only been here since January.”Here, there are neat rows of five Lime scooters on the street corners, and we soon catch up with the person leaving them there: Andrew, a Romanian driving a Lime van who has been working in Copenhagen for two months, repairing and recharging the scooters.He shows me how the handles, the GPS tracker and other parts of the scooter are damaged – “by drunk people” – but not very often. In other cities, scooter-share companies will pay freelancers, nicknamed “juicers”, a bounty for each scooter they charge, but Andrew says that there are 20 people like him in Copenhagen who are all well-paid Lime employees.There is some dispute about how long an e-scooter will last – some need to be replaced after just 28 days’ use in Paris, Albertin says, while Hemmingsen says they can go for up to three months. Andrew says many last much longer. The closest comparison in the UK is with dockless bike companies, three of whom have pulled out of the market within a year, complaining that vandalism in Britain is higher than anywhere else they have done business.The e-scooter firms say they take safety very seriously, and each app will remind riders of some basic safety tips when they scan and hire a scooter. Kristina Nilsson of Voi said the Swedish firm was in the process of creating dedicated parking spots in the 31 cities where they operate, giving riders the incentive of extra credits if they leave them in the right place.“We’re also in the process of rolling out speed zones, so in certain areas you go slower than 20kmh,” she said. Nilsson claims the crackdown by Paris is having an effect: “I understand Paris will have a tender for having only three players there. And we hope to be one of those three.”Some cycling charities see e-scooters as potential allies in the battle to get better cycle paths. Rachel White, head of policy at Sustrans in the UK, said they were “generally supportive” of scooters, if speeds were limited and they were kept off pavements. Beyond safety, they are only worried that having access to effortless travel might make us put in less effort. “A slight concern is that they don’t have the same health benefits as walking or cycling,” she said. “But generally, another group of organisations lobbying for more protective cycleways can only be a good thing.”The UK’s road network may yet dictate the future of e-scooters. In London the volume of traffic dwarfs the number of cars in Copenhagen while the cycling network is far less developed. London has 239km of cycle paths – less than the 375km in Copenhagen, and serving 13 times as many people. And outside the capital, the fragmented and often unreliable public transport system means commuters are wedded to their cars.Paul Hodgkin, CEO of UK mobility start-up Ginger, believes that in spite of this, Britain can introduce e-scooters safely. His firm is in talks about putting e-scooters in business parks and campus universities – on private land. “Innovation is happening elsewhere. Wait-and-see is not a neutral position. If we take too long, the industry will move on and we won’t be able to help set the model and get it right,” Hodgkin said.• This article was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify a comparison of cycle paths serving London and Copenhagen, measured in kilometres.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f59d9a50bc424bf4a1d5e746497e6f41b09d347b/0_37_2866_1720/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fd2fbb9487478f361cadc2c7de56192","title":"christine lagarde ecb berlin eurozone yanis varoufakis","story":"The incoming European Central Bank chief must call for an end to the eurozone’s suicidal fiscal rules, which have now run out of roadChristine Lagarde was a key member of the infamous troika – Greece’s official creditors – who crushed our people’s resistance to perpetual debt bondage. The other key figure alongside the International Monetary Fund’s then managing director was Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who played a central role in that drama by engineering the closure of Greece’s banks. Now, four years later, Lagarde has been anointed to succeed Draghi at the helm of the ECB.Despite her role, and the dealings we had when I was Greece’s finance minister, not once did I feel animosity towards her. I found her intelligent, cordial, respectful. She even acknowledged, in private at least, that Greece had been given a raw deal and that my campaign to cut our public debt was right and proper. Lagarde’s priority was holding the troika’s line and minimising any challenge to its collective authority.The question now is whether Lagarde’s skills are in tune with the task of leading the ECB in the post-Draghi era. Much has been made, by supporters and detractors, of both her unquestionable talent for managing complex institutional tensions and her non-existent monetary policy background. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that the two most influential central banks, the Federal Reserve and the ECB, are now to be led by lawyers with no academic monetary background. The shifting consensus on who is best placed to oversee monetary policy reflects a crisis of financialised capitalism that traditional central banking can no longer address.Lagarde’s greatest challenge is that she is replacing a man credited with saving the eurozone by means of policies that are no longer fit for purpose. If she departs from Draghi’s script, she will face fierce criticism. And if she does not, the eurozone’s never-ending crisis will spin further out of the ECB’s control.Draghi saved the eurozone by printing trillions of euros to fund the bankrupt banks and to allow Italy, Spain and other stressed states (though not Greece) to roll over their debts. To do this, he needed to skilfully subvert the eurozone’s rules which, in turn, required painstaking work to co-opt Germany’s Angela Merkel in his great clash with both the Bundesbank, Germany’s powerful central bank, and Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister.While Draghi’s wall of money helped the eurozone perk up, it could not cure its underlying disease and had some pretty nasty side-effects. Stubborn negative interest rates continue to undermine pension funds and insurance companies in Germany and beyond. Rates remain negative because investment is woefully low due to investors’ self-fulfilling pessimism given the prospect of more austerity.This creates deflationary pressures that eat into the savings of the middle class, replace quality jobs with precarious ones and, thus, beget political monsters across Europe.Most commentators wonder whether Lagarde will be brave enough to continue with Draghi’s “unconventional” policies. This is the wrong question to ask since his trick for keeping key countries, such as Italy, in the eurozone has reached the end of the road both technically and politically.Technically, because Draghi’s success in persuading Berlin to let him buy Italian public debt, and thus keep Italy in the eurozone, hinged on the promise to buy debt from each member state in proportion to the size of their economy – ie buying approximately €2 of German debt for every €1 of Italian debt. However, with Germany producing no new public debt, courtesy of running a budget surplus, Draghi’s strategy for buying Italian debt has fizzled out.And politically, Draghi’s trick has also expired because the deflationary dynamic of the last decade has given birth to a Eurosceptic rightwing Italian government unfazed by the prospect of Italy dropping out of the eurozone.The pertinent question to ask about Lagarde’s ECB tenure is: can she push Berlin to ditch the eurozone’s suicidal fiscal rules (which reinforce Europe’s deflationary dynamic) and to accept the idea of a common, safe debt? If she does not do so, no matter how energetically she continues to impose Draghi’s policies, she will fail the test of history. To succeed she needs to be subtle, creative and confrontational.Subtlety requires that she does not ask Berlin explicitly to denounce dogmas that have, over the years, acquired quasi-religious status.Creativity will help her sell the abandonment of fiscal rules as their reinforcement, via the interest rate mechanism. For example, Lagarde could propose that the ECB help member states refinance their debt, but only the part they were allowed to have according to the eurozone’s own rules – thus, giving Rome a market-based disincentive to borrow excessively. Similarly, there are imaginative ways to create the common debt that Berlin detests but which is essential to the smooth operation of any monetary union – for example, by insisting that the ECB borrows on its own account to roll over Italian, Spanish, German, etc, debt already purchased under Draghi.Lagarde is certainly smart enough to grasp the necessity of such a feat – and to pull it off if she puts her mind to it. The real question is whether she has the inclination to confront Berlin head-on, to the point of telling the German government that it is her way or, ultimately, the end of the euro and a chaotic return to the deutschmark. The omens, I am afraid, are not good.During her IMF days in Washington, Lagarde often had to choose between policies that were to Berlin’s liking or in the fund’s interests. The clearest example was over the extending of Greece’s insolvency by a lethal combination of more loans and more income-sapping austerity. While the IMF’s staff were adamant that Greece needed an outright debt reduction, Lagarde repeatedly sided with Berlin. Forced to choose between Berlin’s favouritism and the interests of the institution she led, she unfailingly opted for the former. If she continues this behaviour after her Frankfurt move, her ECB career will prove inauspicious.• Yanis Varoufakis is the co-founder of DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement).

The headlines wrote themselves last week as more Change UK debris reformed as the Independents. Which faction was definitely, absolutely, fighting on as a party, and which bit was refusing to establish one? Was this the Peoples’ Front of Judea, or the Judean Peoples’ Front? Who got custody of Sarah Wollaston?It feels like some time ago, but for one short period back in the spring, it looked as though the formation of the Independent Group might just catalyse the unravelling of both parties of government. As one of the key instigators of the plan, I can tell you there was only one real metric of success that first week: could we get to the end of it without becoming a punchline? That we pulled that off was a testament to the desire of millions of people, feeling as politically homeless as the MPs that jumped, for something hopeful.We all know what happened next. The formation of the political party, Change UK, and its subsequent rather small and imperfectly formed electoral showing meant that moment passed almost as soon as it came.Nothing can be done, the moderately minded MPs of both legacy parties say, look at what Change UK did and take heed. Our failure is used as the proof point that something new can’t emerge. And yet: in many respects, the case for a proper realignment is stronger than when we left our parties.I shoulder my share of the blame for soiling the pitch. To rush to establish a political party, as just 11 MPs, was an act of hubris. That logo! The bus! We took the kicking that we deserved, especially when our desire to stand in the EU elections seemed destined to split the remain vote. But to use our (predictably) poor showing as an excuse for inaction, is surely the most cynical response of all.We were never going to be able to provide a compelling, centre-ground, future-focused electoral offer on our own. The act of leaving our parties was the beginning of something, not an end in itself. But others still need to face up to their own dilemma in representing parties they believe are unfit for office.So – to the real point of this missive. To my former Labour colleagues (for the Tories’ moment of reckoning will come in the autumn) let me say this: Don’t let Change UK put you off from acting.After last week’s revelations, you know everything you now need to about your leader. He isn’t going to change: the shutting down of democratic processes and debate his instincts on national security the vacuum of leadership on Brexit the stain of anti-Jewish racism in the party and his lack of interest in getting a grip. Truthfully, all this was visible the last time you passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership by a margin of four-to-one.Only two things have changed: his grip on the machinery of the party (insurmountably tighter) and his proximity to Downing Street (undeniably closer). The final foxhole that the moderate Labour MP will sink themselves into is “he’s unelectable, so it doesn’t matter”. Even if this were the case, it should matter. But I think that assessment is also catastrophically wrong. This was the prevailing wisdom last time around, before Labour went on to gain seats and deny the Tories a majority.If all you can come up with is stay and fight, you’re actually going to need to do both. In 2016, the Parliamentary Labour party delivered 172 votes to challenge Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Today’s threshold is 52 MPs and MEPs, and the window for a challenge is closing. If you don’t act now, you will be heading for a speculative autumn election, and campaigning to make a man you believe is unfit to lead your party the leader of our country.There are just 10 days to go before parliament slumps into its long summer – if you can get one in five of your colleagues to support a challenge to the leader of the opposition, you must act now.

However scary it seems, we know deep down that at such fraught moments the unadulterated truth must be spoken out loud – without it there is no real chance of growing closer.The same goes for the European Union. I absolutely love the EU – but if we Brits get a chance for a second referendum in the UK, we will need to argue for remain in different terms than we did last time. We will need to articulate the value of our continuing relationship to the EU in an honest and grownup conversation. We have learned from 2016 that simply cheerleading will not defeat the elaborate lies we know our opponents will concoct, and the disinformation they have already propagated.And, sure, the EU is far from perfect but it is much more than the present state of its institutional organs. It is above all an ideal of community born out of the ashes of the second world war and cemented by the values at the heart of the hard-fought peace: democracy, partnership, and human rights.But it is precisely because I love the EU that I am intent on being honest with all those who are a part of it. Far too often the institutions that are meant to serve us fail to live up to our ideals. No doubt this is no different in Brussels than in Westminster, Washington DC or Paris. Citizens across democracies are desperate for the political class that represents them to champion meaningful answers to their most pressing problems. These days the only visible “solutions” on offer in too many democratic capitals are the fake solutions of the right: endless austerity, hate and renewed nationalism.It is this scourge of nationalism, this contagious preference for scapegoating over dialogue and sustainable co-creation, that is the greatest threat to the European project. Of course, we find this reality starkly visible in the Brexit project, but it is much wider than the UK.Now that I sit in the European parliament, I find myself wondering: what would the generation that fought the war, survived the camps and rebuilt Europe think of our present situation? How would they see far-right Viktor Orbán’s capacity to bulldoze and blackmail his way into blocking from the commission presidency any candidate who poses a threat to his own regressive ideology and anti-European objectives? How would they feel about austerity policies and the Fortress Europe that faces migrants seeking safety on our shores? I suspect they would be heartbroken. François Mitterand’s warning to the European parliament in 1995 that “nationalism is war” (“Le nationalisme c’est la guerre”) and his call for European leaders to be s of peace, security and the future seem more prescient than ever.As a first step towards remedy, it is time to draw inspiration from the examples of the founders of the European project who were not afraid to imagine Europe anew. We must now paint together a future for Europe with all the colours of a vibrant, people-powered and youth-centred democracy: a future of universality, shared purpose, humanity and dignity for all.Let’s start by having European citizens directly elect the president of the commission, giving the European parliament the capacity to propose legislation, and ensuring that human rights and the rule of law are enforced in all member states. Then we need a green new deal financed by a green European investment bank with citizen oversight to reach zero-carbon economies by 2030.Ours is a future of empathy and solidarity, where as citizens of a shared world Europeans consciously and sustainably lead the way to a better, more democratic, greener future for all. This is the vision that we have to fight for – just as our predecessors fought for the very idea of a European Union in the last century.Sometimes for relationships to endure we must find the courage to become better versions of ourselves. This is such a time for the European project.• Magid Magid is a Green party MEP and former lord mayor of Sheffield"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"12 of the best beaches in wales in pictures","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

This presents some very real risks, which we have seen highlighted by the recent failures of some academy trusts.” The system of summary evaluations of Mats was introduced this year and allows Ofsted to carry out inspections of a number of schools and publish inidual reports. Overall findings are discussed with trust leaders before a summary evaluation report on the work of the Mat is published, though an inspection grade, which would be normal with schools, is not given.Six Mats have been the subject of summary evaluations, among them the Outwood Grange academies trust, which has in the past been criticised for its discipline policy and high levels of exclusions. Ofsted’s report was positive overall but recommended that the trust should reduce exclusions by continuing to improve pupil behaviour.Ofted published a report on Monday based on an investigation into Mats, which found that schools in larger trusts benefited from economies of scale, back-office support, training, career progression and recruitment. However, it said some Mats had taken on a large number of struggling schools too quickly, without always having the capacity or leadership necessary to improve them.A Department for Education spokesperson said the academies programme and the freedom it gave school leaders has been at the heart of the government’s education reforms. “Ofsted have already published a number of summary evaluations reports, which are among a wide range of tools we use to hold academy trusts to account. This includes published information about trust performance, annual accounts and letters to trusts where there are issues of under-performance or weaknesses in governance or financial management.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801e44bbbdc1707ef6972a145c98e1a88cae216e/0_299_3721_2232/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6c30c883159fcfb4042c41dfdfc1c8b","title":"james bond 007 black female actor lashana lynch daniel craig","story":"Online joy over Lashana Lynch inheriting James Bond’s codename may be premature. White men won’t give up their hero status so easilyFans have been hoping for a black actor to play James Bond at least since 2012, when Idris Elba was first rumoured as a possible successor to Daniel Craig. The franchise seems to have finally come through this weekend it was reported that Lashana Lynch is going to be the new 007.There was much celebration on social media, which is understandable. But it may be a little premature. Casting black female actors as legacy characters is a great step towards rectifying the historical racism and sexism that has led to a disproportionate number of those characters being white men. But it’s only a step. Black women also need to be written with respect they have to be presented as natural, worthy heroes who deserve to wear the cowl or cape or tux in question. Otherwise, the new hero just becomes another way to demonstrate that the real, worthy hero is the white guy.There are numerous examples of this dynamic. One is the character of James Rhodes, who in various Marvel comics takes over from Tony Stark as the hero Iron Man. Rhodes is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), too, and has long been presented as a kind of successor in waiting for Robert Downey Jr’s Stark.But, despite being the heir to the Iron Man helmet, Rhodes has never managed to get much attention or respect in the MCU. He was first played in the original Iron Man film by Terrence Howard, but creative and money differences meant the actor was cut from Iron Man 2. The role was taken over by Don Cheadle, who got to suit up as War Machine, an Iron Man clone, in a number of MCU films.After Stark dies in Endgame, though, it’s not Rhodes who is pushed forward as his heroic heir, but the white Spider-ManPeter Parker (Tom Holland). Parker is willed access to Stark’s global weapons system in Spider-Man: Far From Home. He and the entire cast of that movie talk at length about who should pick up Stark’s legacy. The most obvious answer is Rhodes, the guy who’s been piloting the armour for years. But he’s not even mentioned no one, apparently, remembers that he exists. Casting a black man as an important legacy character doesn’t matter much if you push him off to the side as soon as it’s his turn to put on the boots.Netflix’s Marvel show Iron Fist dumped its POC legacy character even more dramatically. The martial arts master Iron FistDanny Rand was portrayed for two seasons by Finn Jones. In the last episodes of season two, the Iron Fist power, complete with chest tattoo, was passed to Colleen Wing, played by Jessica Henwick, an Asian woman. Jones never seemed comfortable in the Iron Fist role his Danny Rand was a whiny nonentity, and he performed the fight choreography with a remarkable lack of conviction. Henwick was a much more likable and physically adept performer. It would have been exciting to see her in the title role. But as soon as it passed to her, Netflix cancelled the show.Another instructive example is the character of Bonnie in the television show The Vampire Diaries. In the books that the series is based on, Bonnie is white. The showrunners, though, chose to cast actress Kat Graham. That was meant to be a progressive move. But, as Ebony Elizabeth Thomas argues in her book The Dark Fantastic, the results were mixed. The show’s creators cut out most of Bonnie’s romantic plot arcs and made her a much less sympathetic character than she is in the books. They may have been concerned that white viewers would have trouble identifying with a black character. Whatever their reasons, Thomas points out that the casting change alone was not enough to overcome the powerful impulse to treat black girls’ stories as secondary to those of their white counterparts.The difficulty with changing legacy characters is that the original is generally seen as the iconic version, and successors are temporary and secondary. As a result, the non-white or non-male versions of the character can be treated as afterthoughts or sidekicks, or as mistakes to be quietly pushed from centre stage.There are some counterexamples. The animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse featured African-Latino Miles Morales as Spider-Man, and Morales did get to be the hero of the story, with Peter Parker serving as secondary support. Similarly, Jodie Whittaker’s Dr Who is unquestionably the star of her own episodes. Ocean’s Eight gender-swapped Ocean’s Eleven, and, while a couple of characters from the original franchise have cameos, they never steal the spotlight from the women (as if anyone could steal the spotlight from Rihanna).So will the new Bond treat Lashana Lynch as the real, heroic, central 007? Early reports suggest maybe not. Supposedly, Lynch has inherited the 007 codename, and her mission is to ask Craig’s Bond to come out of retirement for a serious mission. That sounds as if the white, male Bond is still considered the best of the best, with Lynch relegated to a supporting role. It’s not hard to imagine her written as little more than another, slightly glorified Bond girl, who gets killed off halfway through.Or the franchise could do better than that. If the plan is to set up Lynch to take over the mantle from Craig and helm a few Bond movies herself, that would be great. But it’s premature to give the film-makers too much credit. Experience suggests that, no matter what they say to the contrary, white guys are reluctant to pass their legacies on to anyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff85c1697d49a38811677a4a8b351f6d1bb925f/1397_23_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c1dceec99eec30fa0dffe5d5bfebdaf","title":"lashana lynch new 007 james bond daniel craig","story":"Daniel Craig retains title role but 25th instalment in the franchise reveals codename has been reassigned to British actor Lashana LynchWhile Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the next film, the franchise is set for a shake-up, with reports claiming that black British actor Lashana Lynch has been cast as 007 – taking over Bond’s secret agent number after his character leaves M16.The Mail has quoted from an anonymous “movie insider”, who says that the 25th film opens with Bond (Craig), retired in Jamaica, being called back to action to fight a new villain.“There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says, “Come in 007”, and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman,” the source said. “It’s a popcorn-dropping moment. Bond is still Bond but he’s been replaced as 007.”Originally from West London, Lynch, 31, made her film debut in 2011’s Fast Girls, but her breakthrough role came earlier this year, as fighter pilot Maria Rambeau in Captain Marvel.The news of her being given Bond’s famous code name has been widely praised on social media, coming weeks after US singer Halle Bailey was cast as Ariel in Disney’s live action remake of the Little Mermaid.The 25th Bond film – which is being shot in Italy and the UK – has been plagued by difficulties, beginning in October 2015 when Craig said he would “rather slash my wrists” than play Bond again.Despite once saying he would rather take his own life than reprise his role as 007, Daniel Craig confirms he will return as James Bond for the franchise\u0027s 25th movie.Danny Boyle confirms he is working on a script for the next Bond film alongside his Trainspotting collaborator John Hodge.EON Productions’ Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the custodians of the Bond movies, confirm production will begin at the start of December 2018, with the film released in the UK on 25 October 2019 and in the US a fortnight later.Boyle quits the movie over \u0027creative differences\u0027.

Green-shouldered tomatoes too, fat red peppers and a bunch of basil, its leaves as big as bay. A heavy wedge of watermelon perhaps, a cool cucumber and spiky bunches of hot rocket. Summer shopping is frustrating. Peaches or nectarines? Peas in the pod or broad beans? Should we buy radishes and artichokes? We need food for the grill, something to marinade, and yet we still want something of substance. (Seafood for a potato-topped pie, chicken for the barbecue.) From now till late autumn there is almost too much from which to choose. We should make the most of it.A halved watermelon becomes a fixture in the fridge from now till early autumn. Its ruby flesh chilled and waiting to become part of a salad or cut thick and brought out on a plate of crushed ice to finish a garden lunch. A watermelon laughs loudest when it is matched with chilli as it is so often in Mexico, but also when in the company of salty cheeses such as feta or ricotta salata.In deepest summer, I soak iceberg lettuce, bunches of thick-stemmed watercress and white-nippled radishes for 20 minutes in a bowl of ice and water to crisp and refresh. The watermelon needs a good hour or two in the fridge before slicing. The marriage of ice-cold melon, salty cheese and chilli is dazzling. Tweak the amount of chilli flakes to suit your own taste. The batch I have at the moment is fiercely hot, so I proceed with caution, a pinch at a time.Serves 4-6 as a side dishwatercress 1 bunchred chicory leaves 100gradishes 200gcoriander seeds 2 tspolive oil 4 tbsppumpkin seeds 45gfennel seeds 1 tspchilli flakes a pinchwatermelon 1kgmint 10 leavessalted ricotta 50gWash the watercress, discarding any tough stems or less than perfect leaves then submerge in a large bowl of ice and water. Separate the chicory leaves, halve the radishes, then add both to the bowl. Leave them for 20 minutes to crisp and curl.Use a pestle and mortar or spice mill to grind the coriander seeds to a coarse powder. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, then add the coriander, pumpkin and fennel seeds, moving them around for a minute or two until they are warm and fragrant. Add the chilli flakes, continue cooking for a minute, then remove the pan from the heat and set aside.Peel the watermelon, cut into thick slices and then into large chunks into a bowl, removing the seeds as you go.Finely chop the mint leaves, add to the melon then crumble or coarsely grate the ricotta over them. Drain the watercress, chicory and radish and add them to the bowl.Tip the seeds, spices and their oil over the watermelon and tumble everything together gently then transfer to a serving dish and bring to the table.A spice-speckled yogurt marinade is something I use a lot with chicken I plan to grill. It must be said that it does have a habit of sticking to the bars of the grill and the smoke that ensues sets off the fire alarm, so I have taken to browning the marinated chicken under an overhead grill in the oven. The meat shouldn’t be too close to the heat, lest the skin brown before the flesh is cooked through. I move the oven rack closer to the heat towards the end of cooking, to encourage a crisp skin. I think a little charring here and there is to be positively encouraged.Grind the saffron to a powder, tip it into a small bowl then pour the hot water over and leave for 10 minutes.Finely chop the chillies and put them into a large mixing bowl. Peel the garlic, finely chop and add to the chillies, then stir in the yogurt and the saffron liquid and set aside.Place a chicken thigh skin-side down on a chopping board then cut out the bone with a sharp knife. Open each boned thigh flat, skin side down, then bat out with a heavy weight such as a rolling pin or cutlet bat, till the meat is about ½cm thick. Submerge the meat in the yogurt marinade and set aside for a good hour.Put the rocket leaves into a large bowl of ice and water and leave for 15 minutes. Peel the cucumber, then cut into large diagonal chunks. Pick the parsley leaves from the stalks and add to the cucumber, then drain and shake the rocket dry and toss with the cucumber, olive oil and white wine vinegar. (No salt or pepper is needed here.)Heat an overhead (oven) grill. Line a grill pan or oven tray with foil, lay the pieces of chicken on it skin-side down and cook, a good 15-20cm from the heat source, for 8-10 minutes, then turn over and cook the other side. Check the flesh is cooked right through and adjust the proximity of the oven shelf to the heat as necessary. The chicken should be nicely browned, cooked all the way through, its skin patchily gold and dark brown.Serve the chicken hot with the cucumber salad.Prawn shells make a light but flavoursome stock. Stuff the usual aromatics in with them – bay, peppercorns, parsley stalks – but not carrots, which can introduce too much sweetness. I used hake, which was snow-white, cheap and sustainable, but haddock or cod are suitable too, especially if the fillets are thick.I prefer a filling that is mostly fish, but the recipe lends itself to some improvisation. You could cut down on the fish and add instead a couple of handfuls of lightly cooked and skinned broad beans or a large leek sliced and softened in butter.Serves 4raw prawns 500g large bay leaves 3black peppercorn 10water 600mlfloury potatoes such as maris piper 850golive oil 5 tbsphake 700gspring onions 3butter 50gplain flour 50gdouble cream 100mlSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel the prawns, putting the shells into a medium-sized saucepan and returning the prawns to the fridge. Add the bay, peppercorns and water to the pan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, partially cover with a lid, then leave to simmer for 30 minutes before removing from the heat.Peel the potatoes then coarsely grate them. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the potatoes and let them sizzle for a few minutes until pale gold. Using a draining spoon or fish slice, transfer them from the pan to a piece of kitchen paper.Strain the stock and discard the prawn shells and aromatics. Skin the hake and cut into thick pieces about 4cm in length. Roughly chop the spring onions.Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan, add the flour and cook over a moderate heat, stirring constantly till you have a smooth paste. Pour in the prawn stock, stirring with a wooden spoon until you have smooth sauce. As it bubbles, stir in the cream and a few grinds of salt and pepper. Add the hake, pushing the fish under the surface. Leave them for three or four minutes then add the prawns and the chopped spring onions.Transfer the filling to a pie dish, scatter the fried potato over the surface, leaving a few gaps here and there. Bake for 30 minutes till the sauce is bubbling up through the crust.A scarlet slice with which to start dinner a light garden lunch or a weekend breakfast, there is almost no stage on a summer’s day when this tomato toast isn’t appropriate.

Halve, seed and roughly chop the peppers. Put the peppers, shallots and the whole cherry tomatoes snugly in a roasting tin, pour over the 6 tablespoons of olive oil and roast for an hour until all is soft and the skins are blackened here and there.Toast the pine kernels in a dry, shallow pan till golden, shaking them now and again, so they colour evenly. Cut the beefsteak tomatoes into large pieces, put them in a bowl then tip in the pine kernels. Tear the basil leaves from their stems and add them to the tomatoes together with a little salt and a splash of olive oil.Slice the ciabatta in half horizontally. Toast the cut sides until golden and lightly crisp, then place on a serving board or plate. Crush the roast vegetables to a rough puree with a fork, or in a blender or food processor, and spread generously over the toasted bread. Pile the chopped tomatoes and basil on the toast, cut each piece into four slices and serve.Jelly and cream was one of the most looked-forward-to desserts of my childhood, albeit orange jelly from a packet and tinned cream. Don’t even think of juicing your own cherries for the recipe that follows. Better I think is to find a brand of bottled cherry juice without added sugar. (Health food stores are a good hunting ground.) I like a soft, barely set jelly that glows in the glass and shimmers on the spoon rather than one you can set in a mould and turn out. Put a spoonful of the cherry cream on top of the jelly and dig deep for a little of both the sweet, orange-scented cream and sour garnet red jelly.Enough for 6 large wine glasses or 12 small onesgelatine 7 sheetscherries 200gcherry juice 1 litreFor the creamcherries 150gcaster sugar 3 tbsporange finely grated zest of 1 smalldouble cream 250mlPlace the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and leave for a few minutes to soften.

It is usually started by Dad because the plates are not hot enough (so the food goes cold). The discussion then treads a familiar path. Dad’s fixation with hot plates is put down to his Lancashire childhood – my grandma was extremely keen on heating plates, and believed that piping hot food and hot plates was evidence that it was freshly cooked (ie, not sitting around).The irony of this was that when faced with Grandma’s food, everyone spent a great deal of time puffing in and out, saying: “Hot, hot!”, then blowing on the food to cool it down. The opposite pole of the discussion is still that the plates, and subsequently food, are too hot. This is usually started by me, and it boils down to the fact I live in Italy, but that’s for another column.There was also polarity when it came to soup – hot and cold. At least, that was how I used to think about it: there are soups that warm when it is cold, and soups that cool when it is hot. What is becoming more and more apparent is that many of the soups I enjoy most, regardless of the season, inhabit the space in between the extremes – a just-warm to room-temperature spectrum.I have been thinking about this a lot this summer, for as much as I like an icy gazpacho, Vichyssoise, almond or cucumber soup, I think I most enjoy the flavours that come with a soup that is served just-warm. I am thinking about Jane Grigson’s mint and pea, or one that is made with a floppy-leaved Sicilian green called tenerumi, and one made from a pap of bread and tomato, or borlotti beans and pasta – all soups that benefit from moderation rather than extremes. Marcella Hazan has a lovely description of Milanese minestrone with rice in her book The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, describing how, in the hotter months, restaurants would make it in the morning, then leave it sitting to settle to room temperature in readiness for lunch.In the summer I, too, make this Sicilian minestra di patate e peperoni – red pepper, tomato and potato soup – in the morning so it is ready for lunch. I thought it was an odd-sounding soup when I first read about it, but it is surprisingly good, the soft sweetness of the pepper, red onion and ripe tomatoes given starchy substance by the potato.The “recipe” I first followed was a sketch, with no real quantities, from a friend, which I found quite liberating, but I include one below. I haven’t been adding spinach or chard because I didn’t fancy them. The advice of another recipe is to add a spoonful of red-wine vinegar at the end. It is a lovely addition, especially if you have a good vinegar, the soft acidity sharpening the edges and contrasting nicely with the mellow sweetness of the red peppers. For a smoother texture, half the soup can be blended, then added back in at the end. If you are particularly averse to pepper skins, you could cook them separately, roasting, resting and peeling, then adding them towards the end of simmering. You will be skin-free, but it also means the soup won’t have the same depth of flavour or rosy-red colour.Resting the soup once you have made it isn’t just about temperature, but flavour, which develops while it sits. I love this soup when it is just warmer than room temperature, with bread and cheese on the side.“Minestra” comes from the word, ministrare – to administer or share out. The beauty of soup is not just the sharing, but that it is given the shape of the dish it is put in – and the dishes can be any temperature you like.6-8 tbsp olive oil1 red onion, peeled and slicedSalt and black pepper1 large potato (about 400g), peeled and diced2 large red peppers, deseeded and diced2 large tomatoes, peeled, deseeded and roughly chopped1 handful spinach or chardRed-wine vinegar (optional)Put the olive oil, onion and a pinch of salt in a large, heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat.

I had never before thought of it in the same light as a tomato, but tossed in this simple salsa, its sweetness and acidity work remarkably well with the caramelised, fatty pork.Although you can slow cook ribs, they are also beautifully tender when roasted hot and fast.For the marinade1 dried chipotle chilli, or 1 tbsp smoked paprika2 tsp cumin seeds2 garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp dijon mustard2 tbsp tomato puree2 tbsp molasses sugar75ml cider vinegarSalt and black pepperFor the pineapple salsa½ small, ripe pineapple, peeled and core removed½ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped½ small bunch mint, finely chopped ½ small red onion, peeled and finely choppedJuice of 1 limeHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan) 390Fgas 6, if you are going to cook the ribs without marinating. For the marinade, put the chipotle chilli in a small pan, cover with boiling water and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until soft. (Alternatively, to speed things up, put the chilli and water in a heatproof bowl and blast in a microwave for a minute or two). Once soft, discard the stem and remove most of the seeds. Transfer to a tall jug with the cumin, garlic, mustard, tomato puree and molasses sugar. Blitz with a stick blender, slowly pouring in the vinegar to create a smooth paste, and season well with salt and pepper.Put the ribs in a large, foil or silicon-lined baking tray and rub in the marinade. Preferably, leave to marinate for a few hours, or overnight, but if you want to serve them sooner you can cook them immediately. Roast for an hour, turning them over halfway, until the ribs are golden, caramelised and the meat is soft. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and rest somewhere warm for 10 minutes.To make the salsa, cut the pineapple into long, thin strips, then finely chop and transfer to a bowl. Add the other ingredients, and season to taste, adding more lime if needed, and a pinch of sugar if the pineapple is not sweet enough.Serve the ribs with the salsa, some baked potatoes and a crisp slaw of wafer-thin red and white cabbage, radishes, fennel and chopped coriander.Sweat two onions in butter for 15 minutes until soft, then add the marinade ingredients, plus half a bottle of ketchup for a delicious homemade barbecue sauce (ramp up the chilli, if you like). Or mix the marinade into pork or beef mince for delicious burgers. Eat any leftover salsa with chargrilled mackerel or baked sweet potatoes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7945f7520c8f361b5fd9ca45d7ea03f0a741d833/0_186_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3277ae13c51e1a2238f7d845bc6a2f6","title":"rose seeds from syria refugee family cultivating new life lebanon","story":"Sweet-smelling success for Syrians who have settled in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley is dampened by growing anti-Syrian sentimentby Jenny Gustafsson in the Bekaa valley photographs by Alia HajuWhen the plastic bucket is filled with roses, Nahla al-Zarda takes it into the kitchen, where she separates the petals from the buds. She soaks them in boiling water, which blushes pink.“I love this colour. It will be even stronger when the drink is ready,” she says.Her husband, Salem al-Azouq, a man in his mid-40s, is out picking in the small field behind his house, which is filled with roses of the same shade.“There was nothing here when we came five years ago. It looked like that,” he says, pointing to the wheat plantations on either side of the plot.It is six years now since they came to Lebanon, and five years since they moved to the makeshift house at the edge of the plantation. Before that, they were in a refugee camp, like many of the 1 to 2 million Syrians in the country.Al-Azouq works quickly and with ease. He only picks large buds, leaving the smaller ones for later. Now, during the season, he harvests two or three times a week, preferably in the early morning.“That is the best time. The rose is still asleep, holding on to its fragrance,” he says.Behind his back, in the far distance, lies the mountain range separating Lebanon from Syria. Al-Azouq’s home village is beyond those mountains, in a farming area near Damascus.He started coming to Lebanon in 2006 for seasonal work, just like hundreds of thousands of other Syrians. It was always in cultivation: roses and trees were his speciality. Then, the war came. The couple, with their small twin daughters and baby son, fled.“We had just spent all our savings on building a house. Nothing is left of it now. You don’t even hear birds singing in our village today,” says al-Azouq.His youngest son, two-year-old Ahmad, follows his father through the field. When they pass by a tap and buckets being filled up, he stops to play with the water. Al-Azouq points to the different things he grows: red and white roses for people’s gardens, trees about to bear fruit, rosemary, basil and lavender. But the star is a bright pink rose with a fragrant smell, the one he was picking earlier.“It’s the sultani, the best kind of rose. No other has the same strong flavour,” he says.For the rose growers of Lebanon and Syria (lands that gave name to the Damascus rose, cherished by Shakespeare, the Babylonians and ancient Egyptians), this is what ultimately matters. Most of their roses go into making one of the most significant culinary products in the region: rose water.This scented liquid, still produced with the same distillation technique that 11th-century medical scholar Ibn Sina invented, is used in a range of Middle Eastern recipes. Lebanese and Syrians add it to their cheese dessert kanafeh, as well as their date cookies and syrupy baklava. Turks and Iranians flavour ice cream and Turkish delight with it Indians their lassi.Sweets aside, rose water has always had an important place in folk medicine as well, and is used for ailments including digestive issues, high blood pressure and insomnia.“For us, it is part of our tradition of mouneh, preserving food for the winter. This is how we capture the flavours of the season,” says Lebanese food writer Barbara Massaad.The couple do not produce rose water themselves – they do not have the equipment, and al-Azouq’s expertise lies in cultivation and growing. They sell to others in Lebanon doing distillation, both in the Bekaa Valley and on the coast.Despite the history that Lebanon shares with Syria, and the many family ties that cut across the border, anti-Syrian attitudes have been growing in the country. Refugee settlements have been raided and families evicted, and municipalities have imposed curfews on Syrians.“Families are not allowed to leave the camps without a permit, not even to buy water or see the doctor,” says Doha Adi from the organisation Sawa for Development and Aid.After several years of extending great hospitality to Syrian refugees, Lebanon has been struggling with an economic crisis and foreign minister Gebran Bassil recently made anti-refugee statements on Twitter and in speeches.“This way, people are steered towards blaming refugees for their worries, even when they have nothing to do with it,” says Adi.Cultivating roses, al-Azouq and al-Zarda work in one of only three sectors legally open for Syrians: agriculture, construction and waste management. They pay rent for their land, as all refugees do, including the majority of those living in camps.“The flowers we grow are from Syria. We brought seeds with us when we left,” says al-Azouq.He stretches out his hand to pick a rose and almost grabs hold of a bee – but that is OK, he says, he usually gets stung once a day.“I am happy for the bees. They are a sign that the fields are healthy.”Al-Azouq brings two-year-old Ahmad into the kitchen. He is about to go and pick up the other children from school, then pass by the organic farm he runs together with other Syrians, Lebanese and a French brother and sister. Using natural techniques, they aim to protect the bioersity of the region, not least species that have suffered from the war in Syria. They cultivate a range of fruits and vegetables there – but no roses. These are reserved for the family’s backyard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52451c09394c2a7f0abd39c35be13f2116ada46e/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b8304b944be8df0d9a177e34a8b90e8","title":"campaign yorkshire queensbury cycle tunnel backed landowner","story":"David Sunderland says he will block works to close disused Queensbury rail tunnelThe campaign to turn a disused railway line in Yorkshire into England’s longest cycle tunnel has received a boost in the form of a defiant landowner who refuses to let it stay shut.A row has erupted over the 1.4-mile (2.3km) Queensbury line between campaigners, supported by the local councils, and the Department for Transport (DfT), which wants to fill in sections of the tunnel with concrete and then leave it to collapse.David Sunderland, who says he owns the land at one end of the Queensbury tunnel, will not grant access to allow any works to proceed.Alongside nearly 3,500 other objections on Bradford council’s planning website, he wrote that he would not cooperate with any works to abandon Queensbury tunnel, describing it as “an important and valuable public asset”.In response to the application to fill in the tunnel from Highways England, which manages the tunnel for the DfT, he says he will not grant access to the land unless the proposal for a cycle path goes ahead.The campaigners say there is a “once-only opportunity” to turn the tunnel, disused since 1956, into a subterranean walking and cycling route connecting Halifax to Bradford and Keighley. It would form the heart of a new cycle network that would decrease obesity, reduce air pollution and present an alternative to car use in an area where not many people currently cycle.They argue that the plans to abandon the tunnel are now estimated to cost at least £5m of public money, whereas the repairs are estimated to cost up to £6.9m. Sustrans, the environmental charity, has produced a report suggesting the Queensbury cycle route could bring £37.6m worth of economic, health and tourism benefits over 30 years.Highway England’s contractor began strengthening vulnerable parts of the tunnel last year before the main phase of work, which requires planning permission. However, the cost of that work has shot up after Highways England failed to pay the £50 annual rent on a pumping station that keeps the tunnel free from water, resulting in the pump being switched off and the tunnel flooding with 8.2m gallons of water, according to Graeme Bickerdike, who coordinates the Queensbury Tunnel Society’s engineering activities.He said: “Thanks to a combination of fear, ignorance, hysteria and occasional outbreaks of incompetence, Highways England has cost the taxpayers a huge amount of money.”He added: “As we look at our environmental and health responsibilities, we need to facilitate people getting out of cars and on to bikes, which means providing the infrastructure for it.”Campaigners are supported by Bradford and Calverdale councils and local MPs. Holly Lynch, the MP for Halifax, has said restoring the tunnel would return £2.31 in benefits for every £1 invested. In a letter to Bradford council, she says this is a “return that is regarded by the government as high value for money”.Judith Cummins, the MP for Bradford South, has written to Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to call on the government to intervene. She argues that filling in the tunnel is “just so directly at odds with the government’s cycling and walking strategy”. During a debate on cycle and walking paths last week, she said: “The tunnel should be the jewel in the crown of a new cycle and walk greenway to connect the great city of Bradford with Halifax. We should be taking advantage of our historical assets to benefit all of us for years to come.”A decision on whether planning permission will be granted is expected later this month.A spokesperson for Highways England said: “We have now submitted our planning application to Bradford council for further safety work to close Queensbury tunnel.“All the comments that have been received so far will help the council make their decision and we would like to thank everyone for taking the time to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23004210bbfa25a6bb8214e300f849896bcfbae5/0_423_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7b37ce5fdea03f910c3cc77cba6c718","title":"eating disorder obsessive exercise swimming plumpness power","story":"I was used to strict fitness regimes, but lazy, pleasure-driven swims helped me to feel more comfortable in my own skinIt was last September, while on a hen weekend in north Wales, that I realised how important swimming had become to me.There was a temporary break in the organised fun and a clutch of attendees I vaguely knew from university asked if I would join them for a dip at the nearby beach. The conditions were hardly dreamy: it was raining I hadn’t bought a bathing suit the only towel I could use was the child-sized one provided by the Airbnb. But I took them up on it all the same. “I’ll be with you in five minutes,” I said, grinning.In the past, I would have required more coaxing spontaneous, sociable swims were hardly my default mode of exercise. I’d suffered from anorexia in sixth form, and although I’d recovered while at university, in my mid 20s I’d started to slip back into that old, punitive mindset. Supposedly “healthy” eating plans were accompanied by a strict exercise regime: running. Five times a week. Solo. (Just like when I was a calorie-counting A-levels student, I craved control. Having someone join me would require compromise and flexibility – two concepts that seemed about as palatable to my weight-conscious self as supersize tubs of lard.)To clarify, this wasn’t a constant period of anguish. Rather, it was three years or so in which I’d flit between nervy months of restraint and periods of respite when I somehow felt grounded enough to … well, chill out a bit. In these stretches, I could skive my runs entirely – or ditch them for a more leisurely form of exercise. I started going for lazy, pleasure-driven swims, and in doing so clutched at a lifeline that would eventually haul me from the whirlpool of self-criticism and obsessiveness for good. (Well, almost.)As a child I had enjoyed visiting my local pool, but seeing as you can hardly open a newspaper nowadays without someone gushing about wild swimming, the adult me gravitated outdoors. On trips to visit family in Sweden, I floated languorously around calm, cavernous lakes. And like all good arty millennials in London, on boiling Saturdays I made for the ponds on Hampstead Heath.It wasn’t until the hen party, though, that I realised how profoundly swimming had changed me.Tragically, a women-only weekend like that – one involving glamorous outfits and carefully apportioned “getting ready” time – would normally bring out the worst of my neuroses. But instead of glaring at my thighs in the mirror, I was bobbing up and down in the sea in greying underwear, too busy squealing at the cold to think about anything else.The physical benefits of wild swimming are well documented. But for me it was about more than the rush of adrenaline that comes with charging into a freezing sea, or the blissed-out peace you feel while towel-drying your hair in the cool evening air. Swimming outdoors, it turned out, had fundamentally recalibrated my mindset around exercise. After all, unlike running, it wasn’t an activity that I could control and schedule. Unless you’re phenomenally hardy, it’s weather-dependent – and, equally, unless you happen to have a lido on your doorstep, it hinges on location. You do it with friends, and having company blasts any perfectionist routines (“If I don’t do blah lengths in blah amount of time, I will have failed!”) out of the water. I started to appreciate the relief that comes with letting forces beyond yourself – the weather, the seasons, other people – dictate your agenda. While it’s no bad thing to take your fate into your own hands, I had a habit of squashing it once it was there. Swimming taught me the good that can come from letting go.It also helped me to embrace my body. After all, in the water, plumpness is power. When I was at my lightest, in school, I was cold all the time – and swimming, particularly outdoors, was out of the question. But now I can do lengths and lengths without a worry. I’ve stopped dieting, and while numerous factors brought that about, the way swimming made me feel more comfortable in my own skin undoubtedly contributed.Nowadays, I get into the water as much as I can. But it isn’t a strict routine I approach it as a treat, like going for an ice-cream. While I still run, swimming has helped me see the benefits of exercising less intensively. I do a slow jog a couple of times a week – and most of the time it is motivated by a desire to let off steam rather than a compulsion to shed calories.I’d be lying if I said I had shaken off my anxieties completely. I suspect I will always have an obsessive side. Happily, though, swimming is not only helping to keep this under control – it is also the result of doing so. If I’m relaxed enough to jump into the waves on an overcast Saturday, chances are, life is pretty sweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b01f58e04f9596cd30673e0eb8cfcc9a816a253/176_0_5104_3064/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db2128b1cbe57c9389ad0aacb4bc67f6","title":"how we met his tinder profile said he wanted to cycle round the world i asked when are we leaving","story":"Mike and Helen Langridge live in Edinburgh. Mike, 32, is a solicitor and Helen, 30, works for an outdoors clothing companyWhen Helen saw on Mike’s Tinder profile that he was a keen cyclist and wanted to cycle around the world, she sent him a message. “I said: ‘When are we leaving?’,” she recalls, “and he said: ‘How about Tuesday?’”When they met up in a pub a week later, in January 2016, they talked about the trip. “It was, initially, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny? How would you do it?’,” says Helen. “It was on the second date that it started to be a bit more: ‘Why shouldn’t we do it?’ We weren’t happy with our jobs, and we had no responsibilities to hold us back.”After four weeks they were a couple, and after five months they moved in together, mainly to save money. They sold everything worth selling, and stopped spending. Mike was working long hours as a trainee solicitor, but took an evening job in a restaurant. Helen worked in a medical lab and transcribed medical notes in the evenings. In November 2016, Mike proposed, and in April 2017, they embarked on their round-the-world cycle ride. They left on a Tuesday.“Lots of people would say to us, especially when we’d been on the road for a while, ‘That must be like 10 years of marriage condensed into 18 months,’” says Mike. “In a way it was, because we spent every day together.”They didn’t cycle side by side the whole way. “We would very rarely lose sight of each other, but it didn’t mean we were always in conversation every second of the day,” says Helen. “Occasionally I wanted some of my own time, but even then I was like: ‘Don’t go too far.’”They got to know each other, and themselves. “It was a big lesson in compromise, communication and listening,” says Mike. “Not just what someone was saying, but all the non-verbal things: is Helen tired? Is she stressed? She’s saying we can go on, but does she mean it?”And they saw each other during extreme moments. Cycling across Australia – in 40C heat, into a headwind that meant they couldn’t travel more than six miles an hour – was the most brutal time, physically and mentally. “For weeks on end, nothing changed,” says Helen. “We both reacted very differently to release that stress.”Helen cried every day Mike tended to bottle up his emotions, but, after a minor disagreement, had a meltdown. “It’s probably quite a rare thing to learn about a partner,” says Helen. “I guess not many people experience that kind of extreme to know how the other person would react.”Moving on to the US, they cycled from San Diego to Yosemite national park, where they got married. “I think by then we’d done a year and about 12,000 miles,” says Mike. “We were like: ‘We’ll be fine we’ll still love each other enough to get married.’” Their parents and a couple of friends flew out, then Mike and Helen carried on. It was about a month later that Mike nearly died of hypothermia in the Rockies. “That was our honeymoon,” he says with a small laugh.They had left Salt Lake City and were cycling along the hard shoulder of the interstate highway when a storm came in. Within minutes the temperature had dropped to about 4C and there was nowhere to shelter. Helen was in front. “Over the noise of the traffic I heard him shout, so I turned around and he had his eyes closed but he was screaming and crying, and he wasn’t really with it. I don’t know how he hadn’t already cycled into traffic because he was weaving along the hard shoulder with his eyes closed. I dropped my bike, and caught him. His body was curling over the bike and I couldn’t unfurl him.” She turns to him. “You weren’t reacting to me.”She waved a car down and a man helped drag Mike off the bike and get him into the car to try and warm him up until the ambulance arrived.After Mike recovered, they cycled on through Canada, and two months later flew to France and made their way back home, arriving in the UK in August last year. Was it hard to get back to a more normal life? “It’s almost like it never happened,” says Helen. “All those amazing experiences and places and people, it’s like it never happened.” Mike had the harder task, she says, going back to work so quickly.There are new adventures, though of a more stationary kind (they are buying their first house). Everything in their relationship until now had been focused on the trip, says Helen – either planning it, or on it. “I think there was a risk that our relationship was so based around that trip that it could have fallen apart once we came back,” she says. “But it’s very naturally changed into a relationship at home.”Want to share your story?

What’s behind the malaise?Louise set herself two New Year’s resolutions for 2019: to start yoga, and to keep a journal. She did better than most people, sticking to both for five months. About six weeks ago, however, she recognised something was off. “During May, I noticed all I kept writing was how lethargic, below average or ill I was feeling.”Writing in her journal in the first week of June, the 30-year-old from Nottinghamshire wondered if hitting the six-month mark and “the downwards slope to winter” was taking its toll. “I was ready to brush it off as irrational,” she said, “until I saw this.”“This” was a  callout on “mid-year burnout”, asking readers to assess their moods and energy levels at this point in 2019 – were they tracking upwards with the mercury? Or were the longer, warmer days not having the positive impact they usually did?It was undeniably, as one reader said, “a self-selecting sample answering a leading question” – but many more saw the words: “Could you be suffering from mid-year burnout?” and responded with an unequivocal yes. Their responses, mostly submitted on condition of anonymity, told of sleep disrupted by lighter evenings, of unusually bad hay fever, of illnesses still lingering after months.Readers wrote of feeling as if they could fall asleep standing up, of waking with a racing heart or clouded mind, of having lost their energy, appetite or libido. They felt stretched too thin, in and out of work. They would go on holiday and spend all day in bed – or come back from holiday and find the positive effects gone after a couple of days. They were regularly surprised to find themselves irritable or tearful. Many said it was as if the joy had been sucked from life.Some were people whose existence was threatened – by debt, poor physical and mental health, underemployment, austerity, hate crimes or insecure work and housing. But even those who should have been thriving, or at least broadly fine, reported an apparent groundswell of malaise.For every reader who scoffed at the premise of mid-year burnout (“a trendy tag for tiredness. What the hell has the calendar got to do with this?”), there were many like Charlotte, a 47-year-old from East Sussex. “I wake up in the morning and think, did I get drunk last night?” she wrote. “And then I remember, no, this is just what normal feels like now. I’m just tired and moody all the time.”I understood, because I felt the same way. Summer was typically the season when everything just flowed, when longer days and warmer nights seemed to make it easier to balance life and work, while making the life part effortlessly more fun.Not this year, though. This year Lana Del Rey’s seven-year-old Summertime Sadness re-entered the US iTunes chart (“Is everyone OK?” fretted a viral tweet). Though I love my job, have no children or mortgage, am in good health and have taken regular holidays, by June it felt as if I was already out of fuel when I thought I’d only just stopped to fill up. The thought of another six months of running on empty seemed both impossible and inevitable.Gina, 33, from Kent, knew just how I felt. “The weekends don’t seem to bring respite at the moment,” she wrote. She and her husband were both “unusually tired and in need of a holiday this year”, despite a good work-life balance and holiday allowance. “I don’t think you would know from looking at us that we feel burned out – we are very active, busy people, with wholesome leisure activities and an active social life. But it all feels like too much.”There were obvious, numerous and very real reasons why people might be struggling. This was different (and, of course, incomparable, in terms of stakes or urgency): fatigue, felt both at a gut and bodily level, and in the atmosphere. Rob, 53, from The Hague, described himself standing in the shower each morning, yawning. He ached to take some time off, “to do nothing but just be”. “It’s like I lifted my head and it’s June already – how did that happen? It was Christmas a few weeks ago, wasn’t it?”There is some psychological significance to the midway point of the year, as a logical opportunity to take stock. People may be reminded of the optimism that they felt in the new year, or the goals that they set and are now no closer to achieving. “I think all the prospects of possible change die down, and it just becomes a slog towards the end so you can start afresh,” said Louise.Parents (and teachers) find themselves beset with demands for end-of-term events such as sports days and performances. “It is like a race to get to the finish line at home and work,” said a 42-year-old mother of two working in higher education in Worcester. “It is worse than December by some distance as there is only a long summer of juggling childcare and work commitments as a reward.”As in the runup to Christmas, social calendars also tend to fill up in summer – and the assumption of a lighter workload and a break is not always borne out. “It seems that it’s not only the onslaught of work, with various people off on holidays and clients wanting everything, even on a Sunday, but the birthdays, parties, gigs, all at once,” said Robert, 35, from Manchester. “It sounds like I’m being ungrateful. I’m not – I’m just utterly drained.”Other readers attributed their low mood and energy levels to the news cycle. Jan, 38, from Edinburgh, said the expectations of picnics, barbecues and socialising were “emotionally incongruous” with the climate emergency, Trump, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and “the Tory leadership nonsense”: “This year more than ever, I want to hide from the world.”Many readers were holding out for autumn, winter, September, November, Christmas – a point in the not-too-distant future when this low ebb would pass, like bad weather. I thought I understood why. It was the same reason that I’d classified my own desperation as being of the mid-year. It was that the alternative was too grim to consider: that this threadbare feeling wasn’t seasonal, tied to longer, warmer days – but our new basal temperature.But Dr Natasha Bijlani, a consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, says that is exactly right. “I am sceptical about there being such a thing as mid-year burnout. We do know that there are high levels of burnout in our society in general I think it’s reaching epidemic levels. If you asked people the question in April or September, you could say it was the three-quarter-year burnout.”That doesn’t dismiss the issue rather, it casts it as catastrophic. Any discussion of burnout is valuable when so many people are suffering in silence, says Bijlani. “It allows people to be aware of all the time, not just in the middle of the year.”The World Health Organization clarified in May that it does not consider burnout a medical issue rather, it understands it to be an “occupational phenomenon” resulting from chronic and unmanaged workplace stress. It “should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life”.Definitions serve a purpose – especially when classification as a medical condition paves the way for treatment by medication. But for many, the suggestion that feelings about work can be restricted to “the occupational context” will provoke hollow laughter.Readers wrote, with no small desperation, of the impossibility of keeping their job separate from other areas of their life. A 38-year-old public servant said her husband was supportive, their jobs were rewarding and meaningful, their four children “thriving” – but she was hanging on by a thread. “My husband is exhausted with work too, and every day we say, ‘We can do this – just keep swimming.’ Some days it feels like everything is in its place and this is working other days – like today – it feels like the wheels are coming off.”The fix is not as straightforward as taking time off when that can create more work in the leadup, and another pile on your return (while those who remain take up the slack). Londoner Claire, 35, used to work 60-hour weeks, only able to catch up on sleep and laundry at the weekend. “It always got worse in summer – the bosses would take the full six weeks off work and come back all refreshed, while my ‘holiday’ was the August bank holiday weekend, when I’d go to visit family and I’d crash out from exhaustion.”Bijlani sees only the most severe cases of burnout at the Priory, but she lays the blame with a culture that frames overwork as the norm, and the technology that facilitates it. She urges people to observe strict limits on work, and to put themselves first: if that sounds indulgent, she says, it’s only more evidence of the ridiculous state we’re in. Work-life balance should be for everyone, not just those at the tops of their fields. “I’ve had people come in and say, ‘It’s all right for the CEO to do that, but I can’t,’” says Bijlani. “It needs to filter down.”Siobhan Murray, a resilience coach, psychotherapist and author of The Burnout Solution, says the pressure is built into society – from millennials who have had their worth eroded by competitive but unpaid internships and unstable work (“By the time they’re into their late 20s, they’re already burned out”) to thirtysomethings racing to achieve the “bizarre goal” of retiring by 40.Others took on more obligations, such as caring for their elderly parents, without thinking to let go of others, only realising they were overcommitted when they reached breaking point. Of Murray’s 12 current clients, more than half had been signed off work with burnout on their doctors’ orders – some for as long as two months. “There are degrees of burnout,” she says, “and the average  reader isn’t necessarily at that high end where they’re being signed off or going to the Priory – but they could fast be approaching it.”The discovery that a long-awaited getaway may not be as restorative as you had hoped can be a dismal wake-up call. Shorter, more regular holidays throughout the year can help – she suggests taking a week off every three months.We can dream of the introduction of a universal basic income or four-day working week – but for as long as burnout is the baseline of society, Murray says iniduals must be realistic about the demands on their time. She recommends a regular “life audit”, reassessing commitments or goals to prioritise those that matter. “You can’t hit a gym class in the morning and be a parent and travel with your job and see your friends because there are not enough hours in the day. We spring clean our houses we have to get into the habit of doing that with our selves and our lives.”A more balanced schedule – grounded in inidual priorities and realistic expectations, and protected against every attempt to undermine it – may enable us to feel more in control of our lives, says Murray. “It’s about being able to get into bed every night and say: ‘OK, this didn’t work, but this did, so you know what, I did a good job today.’” More openness about the pressures that many of us are under can help us realise that we are not alone, and seek help when we reach breaking point. “There’s a sense of personal failing to burnout, but it’s not,” says Murray. “Sometimes we just need to be able to say: ‘I’m not coping.’”The people who have successfully safeguarded themselves against burnout have learned to go easy on themselves, and they have defined personal boundaries that they defend against everything the world is going to throw at them. “I can guarantee that those are not people who are never going to get burned out and who just have it all sorted,” says Murray. “They’re the ones who have actually experienced it, and know what they have to pull back on in order to be able to live.” And not just until the autumn.All names except Murray and Bijlani have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbc4a9515bb473288c2cd82757157ca764dd5a03/220_0_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb727dd733ffe11058dfa99144d3b1e7","title":"theresa may refuses to defend journalists right to publish leaks","story":"No 10 declines to comment on police threat to prosecute under Official Secrets ActDowning Street has refused to stand up for the right of journalists to publish leaked official documents in the public interest after police warned last week that editors could face prosecution if they reveal any further diplomatic cables from the British ambassador to the US, Sir Kim Darroch.No 10 declined to say that the police should not be telling journalists what they can print, with Theresa May’s official spokeswoman only saying that she believed in a free press.Neil Basu, the politan police assistant commissioner, was criticised on Friday by Tory leadership hopefuls and others for warning owners, editors and publishers not to publish any leaked diplomatic cables because it could be a breach of the Official Secrets Act (OSA).He partially retreated on Saturday, saying the force “respects the rights of the media and has no intention of seeking to prevent editors from publishing stories in the public interest in a liberal democracy”.However, he added: “We have also been told the publication of these specific documents, now knowing they may be a breach of the OSA, could also constitute a criminal offence and one that carries no public interest defence.“We know these documents and potentially others remain in circulation. We have a duty to prevent as well as detect crime and the previous statement was intended to alert to the risk of breaching the OSA.”Boris Johnson, who is expected to be chosen by the Conservatives as the new prime minister next week, said that stopping newspapers printing such documents would represent “an infringement on press freedom and have a chilling effect on public debate”.His rival, Jeremy Hunt, tweeted that the leaks had “damaged UKUS relations \u0026amp cost a loyal ambassador his job, so the person responsible MUST be held fully to account. But I defend to the hilt the right of the press to publish those leaks if they receive them \u0026amp judge them to be in the public interest: that is their job”.Sadiq Khan, the Labour London mayor who is responsible for policing in the capital, told the Daily  on Monday: “Free speech is a vital cornerstone of our democracy. We are rightly the envy of the world. The media must not be told what they can and can’t publish.”However, May’s spokesman refused to comment on the row after repeated questioning at No 10’s regular daily briefing for journalists.“The Met have issued two statements, both of which are a matter for them and I won’t be commenting on either,” he said.“As the the prime minister has said the leak was completely unacceptable and the person who leaked the documents should now face the consequences. I’m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation and it’s important the police are now able to get on with their work. The police’s investigation to identify the leaker has the government’s full support.“On press freedom, the prime minister’s views are very well known. As she has said, a free press is one of the foundations on which our democracy rests.”Most of the offences covered by the legislation affect crown servants and government contractors. Any unlawful disclosure relating to security or intelligence by a member of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ is an offence. Officials do not need to sign the act to be bound by its provisions. The maximum punishment for leaking documents is two years in prison or an unlimited fine.An official is guilty of a crime if he or she \u0027without lawful authority makes a damaging disclosure\u0027 of information about international relations between states, defence, law enforcement, or which falls into a class of information likely to damage the security services’ work. Leaks are deemed to be damaging if, among other consequences, they \u0027endanger the interests of the United Kingdom abroad\u0027. There is a defence for any leaker that they released the material not knowing it would be damaging.\u0026nbspProsecutions under the Official Secrets Act are rare. Recent cases have included that of the MI5 agent David Shayler\u0026nbspin 2002. He was jailed for six months. In 2007, a Scotland Yard civilian employee,\u0026nbspThomas Lund-Lack, was sentenced to eight months for leaking information on planned al-Qaida operations in Britain to a Sunday Times journalist.A number of cases have involved civil servants who mislaid sensitive information. At least one,\u0026nbspRichard Jackson, a Cabinet Office official, was fined £2,500 under the act after he left classified papers relating to al-Qaida and Iraq on a train.\u0026nbspThe police are investigating who leaked Darroch’s memos to the Mail on Sunday, which published more revelations from the ambassador’s memos at the weekend, after Basu’s warning that official documents should be handed back to the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d11c627c6f7476f4200952f5871e442b663e838/0_118_1181_708/master/1181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2224ae4d69b178c8a919baea4bd22fc3","title":"beth ditto how we made gossip standing in the way of control bible belt","story":"‘The lyrics came out in a two-minute splurge. I drew on personal experiences, like growing up in the Bible Belt and being labelled a bitch’In the early 2000s, everyone I knew was in a band but none of us dreamed of breaking through. I used to record my vocals in the bathroom and I was really bad at writing lyrics. So we had lots of half-written punk songs.I’d always been scared of writing lyrics but Standing in the Way of Control came out in a two-minute splurge. I drew on personal experiences, such as growing up in the Bible Belt and being labelled a bitch because I wasn’t going to scripture class, and being called weak because things like sexism, racism and homophobia really affected me. My size was more of an issue then too. I wasn’t bullied at school or anything – I was outgoing and popular – but I’d ask myself: “Why do people think like this?”I guess everyone can relate to the title, the idea of resisting control. It wasn’t just my gay friends who were having dark times. The economy was shit and people were struggling. We were called a gay band, a queer band, a riot grrrl band, but we were just working-class kids and people connected with our song.So many people have told me, “That song got me through ninth grade”, which makes me very happy. Sadly, the song’s as relevant now as ever, and the friend who I wrote it for is having the same crisis once again.We wrote this song in our drummer, Kathy Mendonça’s basement. We were just jamming and I had this disco guitar riff in my mind. Beth’s lyrics filled in the spaces. A band in a basement is a good, simple, organic way for a song to be born.Kathy had a very simple, primal, garage-rock way of drumming, like Moe Tucker from the Velvet Underground. When she left to pursue a degree, Hannah Billie stepped in, using the hi-hat cymbal – and the song just came alive. We recorded it at Bear Creek with Guy Picciotti from Fugazi – a big hero of ours. It was our first time in a real studio but they let us be ourselves. It was still pretty DIY.By then, we’d been playing at being rock stars for years. I first met Beth when we were 13, in Arkansas, and I put her band’s music out on my little cassette tape label. The Bible Belt has some lovely people but can be oppressive when you’re a young punk rocker with a crazy haircut or blue hair. People used to chase us around town.Standing in the Way of Control turned us from outcasts into a mainstream band. The Soulwax remix ended up on the soundtrack for TV series Skins, which was huge in the UK at the time. Beth won NME’s cool Person of the Year award and was loved because of who she is. Everything just started rolling for us. We went on the Jonathan Ross Show. We were driving to another show when we heard our song on the radio for the first time. Everyone went: “Waaaaaah!”I think we handled our British success pretty well. No one became an egomaniacal rock star asshole and we didn’t turn into Oasis and beat each other up. We played some wild shows that felt like Stooges concerts. Then it was nice to come back to America where nobody cared about us and everything was back to normal.• The UK leg of Gossip’s tour celebrating the 10th anniversary of their album Music for Men starts on 19 July in Glasgow.

Times have changed. In 1992, when out women in pop were virtually unheard of, the Canadian singer’s landmark album Ingénue subverted traditionally conservative country music – initially to bad reviews. When she came out during the album’s promotional campaign, some radio stations stopped playing her music and she faced a picket line at the Grammys (she has since shrugged this off, saying she’d already faced worse when she made an anti-meat-eating advert for Peta). By then, though, Constant Craving was a global hit and Ingénue was on its way to shipping multi-platinum, turning lang into an icon.The strange thing about her performing the album again now – on the Ingénue Redux tour – is that for all the progressions of same-sex marriage, oppressive attitudes are rising once again. Recent homophobic attacks and last week’s startling news that intolerance of gay sex is on the rise for the first time since the 1980s Aids crisis have certainly sharpened the songs’ relevance. When lang sings about being unable to discuss her feelings so she ends up talking to herself, “causing great concern for my health”, in The Mind of Love, she could have written the words yesterday.With her black suit and boyish quiff, the 57-year-old retains the androgynous style that once led Madonna to exclaim, “Elvis lives, and she’s beautiful” and paved the way for, say, the gender-fluid Héloïse Letissier, AKA Chris. lang’s voice remains as pure as the proverbial driven snow and yet, serious song content aside, she’s a hoot. She asks the audience “How the Hull are you?”, illustrates the accordion-powered Miss Chatelaine with a comical Morecambe \u0026amp Wise-type jig and makes rude jokes about “strapping on” her acoustic guitar. Suddenly, though, she announces an end to the “bantz” because it will ruin Ingénue’s “hypnotic effect” and she’s right.These are songs of desire, denial, repression and devotion. Wash Me Clean finds her reaching deep into her well of emotions for the line: “My desire carries no shame.” Her excellent band, featuring Ingénue bassist David Piltch, deliver the album’s mix of roots and lush pop almost entirely as it was, although there’s a new monologue about a cypress tree. A jazzy Season of Hollow Soul erupts into its soaring Abba-style chorus Outside Myself remains an ecstatic cry for freedom.lang’s concerns are always widening. She talks about the “insanities” in the US and dedicates songs to environmentalist Greta Thunberg and gun control campaigner Emma González. When she urges everyone to turn the world’s rising hatred into love, it’s more heartfelt plea than cheesy patter. The encores include a beautiful reworking of Neil Young’s Helpless and a version of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah wherein lang holds every note like a prayer.Constant Craving closes the Ingénue section, as on the album. lang delivers it perfectly before handing the microphone to the audience for them to sing, slightly off-key but joyously and arm in arm. The evergreen chorus of “Constant craving has always been” sounds like an uplifting celebration of hard-won freedoms and a defiant manifesto for battles that are still ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c02472062070f107f6bcebf07ee7cc2a764a962/0_0_14473_8684/master/14473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3c06fa898ca329a44ae1dad7ad7c1ed","title":"euthanasia and assisted dying rates are soaring but where are they legal","story":"It is available in a growing number of countries and jurisdictions – but not the UK, where it remains outlawed“The main difference between euthanasia and assisted suicide is who performs the final, fatal act,” said Richard Huxtable, professor of medical ethics and law at the University of Bristol.Euthanasia refers to active steps taken to end someone’s life to stop their suffering and the “final deed” is undertaken by someone other than the inidual, for example a doctor. If the person concerned has requested this, it falls under the term “voluntary euthanasia”.Assisted suicide is about helping someone to take their own life at their request – in other words the final deed is undertaken by the person themselves. Assisted dying can be used to mean both euthanasia, generally voluntary, and assisted suicide however, some campaign groups use it to refer only to assisted suicide of terminally ill people.“One of the dilemmas we have in these ongoing debates is how people use the various phrases,” says Huxtable. Most, but not all, jurisdictions that allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide require the involvement of medical professionals.Palliative sedation, in which people can request to be kept under deep sedation until they die, is allowed in many countries, including the Netherlands and France – is not euthanasia.The Netherlands and Switzerland are the most well known, and Belgium considered perhaps the most liberal, but several other jurisdictions allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide. That said, permitted circumstances differ considerably.In the Netherlands both euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if the patient is enduring unbearable suffering and there is no prospect of improvement. Anyone from the age of 12 can request this, but parental consent is required if a child is under 16. There are a number of checks and balances, including that doctors must consult with at least one other, independent doctor on whether patient meets the necessary criteria.Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada and Colombia also allow both euthanasia and assisted suicide, although there are differences – for example only terminal patients can request it in Colombia, while Belgium has no age restriction for children (although they must have a terminal illness).Again, the exact circumstances in which assisted suicide is allowed vary, with some jurisdictions – Oregon and Vermont – only allowing it in the case of terminal illness. For some places it is permitted not because laws have been passed, but because laws do not prohibit it. For example in Switzerland it is an offence to assist a suicide if it is done with selfish motives. “The result of that is there is this growth of not-for-profit organisations,” says Prof Penney Lewis, an expert on the law around end-of-life care at King’s College London.Other countries, including New Zealand, are considering legalising some form of euthanasia.Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal. Euthanasia can lead to a murder charge and assisted suicide could result in a sentence of up to 14 years in prison.It is not normally illegal for a patient to be given treatment to relieve distress that could indirectly shorten life – but this is not euthanasia. It is already legal in the UK for patients to refuse treatment, even if that could shorten their life, and for medical care to be withdrawn by doctors in certain cases, for example where a patient is in a vegetative state and will not recover (sometimes controversially called passive euthanasia).Total figures from around the world are hard to collate. Figures from Switzerland show that the numbers of those living in the country who underwent assisted suicide rose from 187 in 2003 to 965 in 2015.Agnes van der Heide, professor of decision-making and care at the end of life at the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, says the reason euthanasia is more common than assisted suicide in the Netherlands is multifaceted. Doctors may feel that by performing the deed themselves they can have more control over dosages and the time the procedure takes.“Patients are often in a very advanced stage of their disease where it is practically difficult if not impossible to drink the lethal drink they have to take when they chose for assistance in suicide,” she adds. “It is a very bitter-tasting drink and it is quite an effort to drink it until the end,” she added. There might also be an element of viewing the act as a medical procedure and hence preferring a physician to do the job.Lewis says the vast majority of people do not end their lives by euthanasia even if they can. “There is far more withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, even in jurisdictions that permit euthanasia,” she says.Noa Pothoven, who was 17, died last month – she had anorexia and severe depression. At first media reports suggested she had been “legally euthanised”, but later reports said it was unclear how she died, with her friends releasing a comment saying that she died after she stopped eating and drinking.Van der Heide said that while she could not comment on Pothoven’s case, it is possible for minors over the age of 12 to seek euthanasia or assisted suicide in the Netherlands, under certain conditions.In some places, yes. According to van der Heide, while suicide tourism is not formally forbidden in the Netherlands, physicians must work with the patient to establish that they meet certain criteria. “I think if a physician would provide euthanasia to a patient he doesn’t know then it is very likely that the regional committee would have a problem with that,” she says.However, people do travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide. According to statistics from Dignitas, 221 people travelled to the country for this purpose in 2018, 87 of whom were from Germany, 31 from France and 24 from the UK.Euthanasia and assisted suicide have proved contentious among doctors. Some argue that support for such ideas goes against the commitment to “do no harm”. Others say some people might choose not to end their life if they are made aware that they could be made comfortable with good end of life care.“Some health professionals are familiar with the care of dying patients and with what palliative care can do – so they may have a feeling that assisted dying isn’t always necessary ,” says Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford. “All the criteria and also the practice of euthanasia is mainly shaped by how physicians feel it should be,” says van der Heide. “I think for the typical patient with end-stage cancer and severe unbearable suffering, there is hardly any physician in the Netherlands who thinks that the issue of harming patients is at stake there.”That depends how you look at it. Support for the Dutch laws clearly remains high, but some say there are signs of a “slippery slope”, with the practice being applied too widely.However as Huxtable points out, other jurisdictions including Oregon show that broadening of use is not inevitable. “The fact there has been some slide in the Netherlands should give everyone reason to pause,” he says. “We should think right form the outset what do we think in principle is defensible and are we going to – and we should – police the boundaries.”There have also been allegations of malpractice. In 2018 both the Netherlands and Belgium reported their first cases in which doctors were investigated for possibly breaching the laws, with three more investigations under way in the Netherlands involving the euthanasia of psychiatric patients.“Nowadays there are more controversial cases, so the likelihood that there now will be cases that do not fulfil the criteria to the extent that the public prosecutor thinks it is necessary to install a criminal procedure is more likely than it used to be,” says van der Heide.There have been concerns by disabilities groups that as euthanasia and assisted suicide become more common, it could put a pressure on those living with non-terminal conditions to end their lives. But van der Heide says doctors in the Netherlands take great care when dealing with requests to make sure patients meet strict requirements, and turn down those who do not.She adds that the development of laws to allow euthanasia or assisted dying must be handled carefully. “I indeed acknowledge that having a system in which euthanasia is an option should be really carefully monitored and researched because it in principle involves the risk of life of vulnerable people being regarded as less worthy or more prone to doctors’ assistance in dying,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

The party denies the allegations.It represents another major challenge to Corbyn from within his shadow cabinet, after the deputy leader, Tom Watson, wrote to Jennie Formby, Labour’s general secretary, accusing party bosses of having “smeared” former staff members who criticised Labour’s handling of complaints.Watson himself has come in for criticism for taking Formby to task when she is undergoing chemotherapy, and Labour has accused the BBC of bias over the Panorama programme.In their letter, the four Labour peers set out their concerns about the party’s approach to tackling antisemitism, saying: “It is now a toxic and endemic problem that we have failed to eradicate. Whatever action has been taken has failed to give confidence to Jewish and non-Jewish members alike that there is an absolute determined will to effectively deal with their concerns.“This failure goes to the core of Labour’s values and ideals. How can we be seen to be the party that above all others promotes equality, and that embodies anti-racism and anti-discrimination, if we appear to tolerate antisemitism?“It is deeply saddening, but not surprising, that three of our valued colleagues recently resigned the Labour Lords whip. The scale of abuse that they and others have suffered is heartbreaking.”They also criticised the party’s reaction to the allegations about the handling of complaints made in the Panorama programme. Labour responded by complaining to the BBC and dismissing the whistleblowers as “disaffected employees”.They said: “Also heartbreaking was the decision to attack those who spoke out in last week’s edition of Panorama. Whilst there may be genuine concerns about the making of the programme, the accounts of members and former staff was powerful and shaming. We understand that any employer requires former staff not to disclose sensitive data, but non-disclosure agreements should never be used to silence criticism or to avoid embarrassment – especially by the Labour party.”They made a three-pronged offer to Corbyn for peers to help tackle the problem, saying a small panel from the Lords could review the Panorama allegations and report back to the leader, national executive committee and wider party.“This would necessarily mean that they have full access to existing and former party staff, as well as all paper and electronic records,” they said.The second offer was to draw on the trade union, legal and other experience in the group to set up a new complaints process, and the third offer was to propose how the party’s governance arrangements could be improved to foster transparency and proper decision-making.It ended: “As the leader of our party you have a responsibility to ensure that we do this. In particular, you need to demonstrate decisive leadership that Labour is determined and committed to do everything possible to remove antisemitism, and those that defend it, from our party. Without full openness, this is a cancer that will continue to grow – and, in hurting us, it will most hurt those that need a Labour government.”The letter came as Labour staffers demanded an explanation from party bosses over the treatment of the Panorama whistleblowers. Eight former employees discussed the handling of antisemitism allegations on the programme.More than 200 former and current Labour staffers wrote to Corbyn asking for more support for whistleblowers after the programme. That letter, coordinated by the former MEP candidate Amy Fowler, said staff had watched the programme on Wednesday night with “alarm and anxiety” and that the party’s response had been “to smear Jewish victims, and former staff, accusing them of acting in bad faith”.It said: “The way the party has threatened and denigrated these whistleblowers is appalling, hypocritical and a total betrayal of Labour’s core values. Exposing racism and corruption represents Labour values in action, and these whistleblowers should be thanked, not demonised.”It also addressed a series of questions to Corbyn about the extent of his knowledge about any interference in antisemitism cases and the workplace atmosphere in the party.“The crisis has moved beyond a question of rules and disciplinary processes, to a question of a political culture, and crucially, leadership,” the letter said. “As its leader, the moral responsibility for Labour’s antisemitism crisis ultimately sits with you. Own that responsibility, or give it away to someone who will.”Labour staffers in the GMB union have also submitted a motion for discussion at their branch meeting this week, demanding an apology for the party’s response and condemning “obscene threats of legal action”.The motion, which will be debated on Thursday, condemns the Labour press office’s Twitter response to the programme and says it was “unacceptable for an employee’s workload or the culture of an organisation to cause staff to have breakdowns or to contemplate suicide as several whistleblowers claimed on the programme”.In response to Panorama on Wednesday, a Labour party spokesperson said several of the whistleblowers involved were staff with political grudges against Corbyn.“These disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind,” the spokesman said. “It is simply untrue to say that there were any significant number of disagreements about what constituted antisemitism.“Labour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased fourfold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/199858d27fb8a3815025a7d17dda40ff59624513/0_145_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c088026320bbcaba4c430594f0940206","title":"share your memories of the apollo 11 moon landings","story":"Do you remember where you were when man first landed on the moon?

Indeed, later in his career Turing wrote a seminal paper explaining how patterns such as spots and stripes can appear during chemical reactions.While the importance of Turing’s work and the foundations he laid have become increasingly apparent with time, so too have his personal struggles. These have been highlighted in a biography and a number of plays in the 1980s, as well as the 2014 film The Imitation Game, in which Turing was played by Benedict Cumberbatch.Born in London in 1912, Turing joined Sherborne school at 13. His reports suggest his abilities were mixed, but hint at his imagination and originality. “He must remember that Cambridge will want sound knowledge rather than vague ideas,” his physics teacher wrote.Turing joined King’s College, Cambridge, in 1931 and became a fellow there in 1935. What followed were a number of seminal ideas, including his vision of a universal computing machine, which can be fed an algorithm for a particular computation and then apply it. It was an idea that was to be pivotal in the development of the computers we use today.After a stint at Princeton University in America, Turing returned to the UK, where he worked in code-breaking. With the outbreak of war, he joined Bletchley Park.As a gay man in the early 1950s, at a time when homosexual acts were illegal, Turing faced a demeaning choice when a burglary at his home brought Turing’s relationship with a man to police attention.He was found guilty of gross indecency and had to decide between going to prison or undergoing chemical castration. He chose the latter, a horrifying treatment that involved hormonal injections.Turing died in June 1954, aged 41, at his home in Wilmslow, near Manchester, in an apparent suicide. On Christmas Eve in 2013, the Queen signed a posthumous pardon for him.Turing’s legacy lives on in the machines we take for granted every day, with his name also linked to burgeoning advances. The best known of these is the benchmark Turing test for whether a machine that can think like a human, which hinges on whether human judges can distinguish a computer’s text answers from those given by a person."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c75660ef976f3730ada8d62033aaf2e443703d2/0_543_3345_2006/master/3345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d7aaba15b00ff8ee1431749ff34ba4","title":"did you solve it cheese cube nibbles","story":"The solutions to today’s problems - with cheesy pics!Earlier today I set you the following four puzzles:1. You have a cube of cheese that measures 3 x 3 x 3 inches, and you want to slice it into 27 smaller 1 x 1 x 1 inch cubes, as shown below. If you have a straight knife, what’s the minimum number of slices you need to do it? You are allowed to rearrange the pieces after each slice.Does it make any difference if you have a really, really elastic cheese?With a rigid cheese, the minimum number of slices is 6, which are the slices along the dotted lines in the picture. That’s two through each set of parallel faces. Consider it this way: if you are going to cut the cube into 27 smaller ‘subcubes’, these subcubes will be the 9 on the bottom horizontal slice, the 9 on the middle horizontal slice and the 9 on the top horizontal slice. The subcube in the centre of the middle slice will require six slices, because it has six faces, and each of these faces will need to be cut from a different slice. (All the other subcubes have once face that is part of an external face of the original cube, so these subcubes require less slices. But the middle one requires six).In the case of a really, really elastic cheese, if it were possible to fold the cube over, so that one slice could cut two faces (These faces would be parallel once the cheese was unfolded), then theoretically you only need three slices: one slice for each set of parallel faces. You would need to fold the cheese over in three different (perpendicular) ways for each of these slices. Messy!2. A cube of cheese is ided into 27 identical smaller ‘subcubes’, as above. A mouse starts at one of the corner subcubes and eats his way through the cheese (without ever passing through the same subcube more than once.) Whatever subcube the mouse is in, it can only move into a subcube that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to it.Show a path through the cheese that passes through every subcube and ends in the centre subcube, or prove that such a path is impossible.It’s impossible. Imagine that the 27 subcubes are coloured as in a 3-d chequerboard, so every white cube is vertically and horizontally adjacent only to black cubes, and vice versa. Let the corner sub cubes all be black. The cube thus contains 14 black sub cubes, and 13 white sub cubes. The centre subcube will be white.If the mouse can only travel horizontally or vertically, the subcubes it travels through must alternate black and white. So if the first cube visited is black, every odd-numbered cube it visits will be black, and every even-numbered cube will be white. It is therefore impossible for the 27th cube to be white, so the (white) centre cube cannot be the final cube visited.3. A cheese cube is sitting on a horizontal table. If you slice it in half by making a vertical cut, midway between, and parallel to, two of the sides, the cross section of the cut will be a square.How do you slice a cube into two equal parts, such that the cross-section of the slice is a hexagon?The fact you can get a hexagon out of a cube is a lovely surprise. You cut it like this:Reader Rachel Baker made one out of butter (she had ran out of cheese):4. How do you slice a cube of cheese into six pieces of identical volume with only three cuts?The most pleasing symmetrical method is to cut down the diagonals, as Rachel Baker demonstrates here with a cube of parmigiano reggiano. Slice 1 is vertical from the diagonal on the top face to the diagonal on the bottom face.Slices 2 and three are between the diagonals on other pairs of faces. Each of the three diagonals needs to meet at one of the vertices of the cube.The six pieces are all tetrahedrons – four-sided objects where each side is a triangle, in this case isoceles triangles. The pieces have identical volume but are not identical, coming in two orientations. Rachel’s impressively neat slicing earns her today’s prize of one of my books. Rachel’s is not the only solution. A simpler method is demonstrated here by Ed Southall. Easy cheesy!In fact, Ed came up with many creative solutions. Just as there is more than one way to skin a cat, there is more than one way to slice a cheese cube.Ed knows a thing or two about geometry and canapés: he is the author of the fantastic Geometry Snacks.

Spread out in the right places on Mars, the sheets would warm the ground and melt enough subsurface ice to keep plants alive.Robin Wordsworth, who worked on the sheets at Harvard University, said: “If we want to make sustainable habitats on another planet using present-day technology, this approach could be very useful. It’s completely scalable, so the area covered could be anywhere from a few square metres to large regions of the planet.”Should humans ever decide to spread beyond Earth, as the late Stephen Hawking declared we must, then growing food on alien worlds will be a skill that has to be mastered. But on Mars the conditions are hardly conducive. The planet is frigid and dry and bombarded by radiation, the soil contains potentially toxic chemicals and the wispy atmosphere is low on nitrogen.In the past, scientists and science fiction writers have proposed “terraforming” barren worlds, an approach that calls for the whole atmosphere to be rebuilt. In 1971 the American astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that vaporising the northern polar ice cap on Mars might release enough water into the atmosphere to do the trick. More modest ideas have involved erecting greenhouses instead.The aerogel sheets do not solve all of the problems but they could help future spacefarers create fertile oases on desolate planets where plants and other photosynthesising organisms can take root. Because life would only grow beneath the sheets, the risk of contaminating the rest of Mars with foreign lifeforms would be minimal, Wordsworth said.“Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the Martian surface could therefore allow photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention,” the researchers wrote in Nature Astronomy. The sheets could be laid directly on the ground to grow algae and aquatic plants, or suspended to provide room for land plants to grow beneath them.Wordsworth said: “The best place to try this is similar to where you’d want to land humans: at mid-latitudes where sunlight levels are still relatively high, but where it’s close enough to the polar caps that near-surface ice deposits are still scattered around.“You can imagine this being used in a number of ways. The most achievable in the short term would be a small-scale test with a robotic lander. In the longer term it could be used in support of human exploration missions, and eventually to produce long-lived habitats that you would aim to make as self-sustaining as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10541d22facbcaadfefece21f39b888f9d9d88e2/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d63ecf7871a3ea01e5897b1ea2c07c6","title":"how has the menopause affected you share you experiences","story":"We’d like to find out what sort of support you have had at work or home and what if anything has helped symptoms?

India losing is always an event, all the more so when it’s “a nipper” and the crowd is fully involved. But the final probably shades it, if only for the fact it was a complete mind-bending LSD trip of cricketing lunacy.EJ Clearly the last one. But West Indies v New Zealand ran it close – it also had more dynamic inidual performances, a see-sawing narrative, multiple Sheldon Cottrell salutes, and a lot more sixes than the final.TA The final: the greatest match in the history of one-day cricket, if not all cricket, with heartbreak and joy ided only by the number of boundaries. A highly commended too for every game at Old Trafford, especially the semi-final.VM Stokes’ catch at the Oval launched the tournament brilliantly but Martin Guptill gets the gong for his run out of MS Dhoni at Old Trafford and that throw at Lord’s which prompted the ricochet.AB The last half-hour of the final.

So how about Martin Guptill’s glory moment, running out MS Dhoni in the semi, while Ian Smith screamed “IS THIS THE WORLD CUP?” It wasn’t, but it might have been.TA When Eoin Morgan gave the ball to Archer for the super over, trusting his youngest, newest bowler with the World Cup’s most pressurised moments. That ability to hold their nerve was utterly astonishing.VM Bangladesh. They travelled far and filled every corner of Taunton’s County Ground including a prestigious area in one of the pavilions, prompting the innocent query: “Are they members?”AB Pakistan’s, and in particular the guy dressed as a sheikh who arrived for the match against India at Old Trafford riding a white shirehorse down the Talbot Road.

At least sanity prevailed for the final.AB That more of the tournament wasn’t available on free-to-air TV, blame the ECB and the ICC for their money-grubbing broadcast strategies, which price the terrestrial stations out of bidding for the rights.AM The ECB’s “not us, guv” spin whenever they fielded questions about the TV rights, as if the ICC is independently-run and they have zero influence from their seat at the top table. Laughable stuff, really.BR The format is wrong. World Cups need at least three knockout rounds. Take a hit on the guaranteed Indian TV money. They’ll still be there to the end anyway.EJ That most people in the UK had little idea their country was hosting a Cricket World Cup until the final. Sky’s generous agreement to share coverage on free-to-air TV was too little too late.TA The tournament’s half-arsed attitude to sustainability. The competition played lip-service to the idea of being green, despite most of the playing nations being at the heart of the climate emergency.VM The format changes every time. So does my view of the best one. Currently I favour 14 teams, two groups of seven, a passage to the semi-final for the group winners, “quarter-finals” for the other four qualifying teams. This means fewer games and a slightly shorter tournament – so the ICC may not like it.AB Kill off the Royal Stag “Make It Large” adverts, for one, with their ear-bleeding jingle. If you want to fill grounds with families, don’t then try and flog them whisky. Especially if the whisky is Royal Stag.AM Would be head-to-head results between sides ahead of net run-rate in the hierarchy of tie-breakers for the group table(s). It just seems like a simpler method for the wider public to understand.BR Expand it to 12 teams. World Cups need to spread the game not concentrate its energy in one place. And as for the cricketarist … I will look for you. I will find you … And I will kill you.EJ I’d like to see the cricketarist replaced by musical entertainment that’s both musical and entertains. And less American-style forced fun on the big screens between overs – no one needs snack cam, or Lord’s trying to Make It Large.TA Other than get it on free-to-air TV … ensure that the scoreboards do what they say they’ll do. Too often they were plastered with adverts at crucial times – irritating for regulars, hopeless for new fans.VM … not be accustomed to 50-over cricket since none of the best ones will have played this format in county cricket for four years. It’s been a grand tournament, but the ECB has relegated the 50-over game it becomes developmental and peripheral from now onwards. However if they reduce matches to 100 balls per side in 2023 the rest of the world had better watch out.AB … keep getting bowled out in 16.4 overs because all their players will have spent the last four years playing in The Hundred?AM … probably still be in decent shape given the ages of those currently in the team and some very good players of spin. With domestic 50-over cricket set to become second-class, it’s further down the line where you worry.BR … have a completely different team. Only Archer in the current one is under 28. The top three will be 33 or 32 and the best bowler from the final will be 38. The question is whether there’s a layer of talent waiting to come through. The back-up batting here suggests it’s quite a big question.EJ … have some World Cup winners in their team. And that’s a first.TA … not be able to top that!

The hosts lifted the trophy for the first time after beating New Zealand following a super over at Lord’s.England matched New Zealand’s score of 241 from the final delivery, but earlier in the concluding over they were awarded six runs in bizarre circumstances. With nine needed from three deliveries, Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid pushed for a second run when a throw from the boundary deflected off Stokes’s outstretched bat and away to the boundary for four byes and six in total.But Taufel, who was named the ICC’s umpire of the year on five occasions, told foxsports.au: “They should have been awarded five runs, not six. It’s a clear mistake. It’s an error of judgment.Law 19.8 of the MCC rulebook states: “If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be any runs for penalties awarded to either side and the allowance for the boundary and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.”Taufel told the Sydney Morning Herald: “So given that scenario, five runs should have been the correct allocation of runs, and Ben Stokes should have been at the non-striker’s end for the next delivery.”Replays showed Stokes and Rashid had not crossed when the throw came in from Martin Guptill. The ICC, meanwhile, are said to be satisfied with the conclusion of the final, which after both the match and the Super Over were tied went down to boundary countback, with England having struck 26 over the course of the day to New Zealand’s 17.A spokesperson told the  that this method of super over tie-breaker is well established across a number of domestic Twenty20 leagues and would only be reviewed in conjunction with them.

One thing no one has ever recommended, though, is the remedy the ECB concocted for their World Cup winning team, which involved a meet-and-greet with hundreds of screaming primary-school children on the outfield at the Oval, a round of press and TV interviews, and then, to cap it all off, a swift hair-of-the-dog with Theresa May at No 10 Downing Street.

This time you wondered, for a minute, whether Eoin Morgan was going to lose the World Cup trophy when he disappeared beneath a wave of overexcited schoolchildren, who started climbing all over him, and each other, to get at it. At one point, one of the bigger kids among them seemed to have actually wrenched the cup away from him, before someone wisely decided that maybe they should hurry the thing back indoors again.The players stuck it out for another 10 minutes before someone snapped and the stewards decided to kettle all the kids in a far corner. After that, the players took a quarter-lap of honour in front of the few hundred adult fans who had come down to the ground after the ECB put out an invitation by email late on Sunday night. There is no point lying, it seemed a fairly strange, subdued, and chaotic way to celebrate one of the great sporting achievements. In 2005, when England regained the Ashes, they marked it with an open-topped bus parade and a party in Trafalgar Square that pulled in almost a quarter of a million. This time, aside from the kids, they had perhaps a quarter of a thousand.“Yes, a very different celebration today compared to the one in 2005,” said Ashley Giles, who was involved in both, that one as a player, this as England’s director of cricket. “But the guys coming down here today, sharing it with these kids, things like this are how you inspire future generations.”It felt almost as if the ECB had spent so long planning how to win this World Cup, hiring Trevor Bayliss, rejigging their central contract system, rearranging the county schedules, that they had not actually stopped to think about what they would do if they did. It turned out that the children were all going to be here anyway for an event that had already been arranged by Surrey. They had decided a couple of months ago to throw an after-the-Cup cricket carnival for kids from the local schools and clubs, and England were piggybacking on that. The ECB reached out to them two weeks ago and asked if the team could come along to join in with them.Silly as it all was, it felt sweet and fitting, too, a small new beginning for a sport that has been in slow decline for the past 14 years, ever since the ECB first shut it away behind a paywall on Sky TV. Amazing as Sunday’s game was, one day on free-to-air TV is not going to fix that. There is a long way to go, but maybe here, among all these little kids in their blue baseball caps waving their plastic bats and going crazy for their new heroes, screaming, shouting, clamouring, yammering over Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid and the rest of them, there were the seeds of the revival.Joe Root seemed to think so. “It shows it’s a growing game and we’re doing everything we can to widen the reach of it,” he said. “As a team we talk a lot about how we want to leave the game in a better place when we finish. And I feel like the way we’ve gone about things in this World Cup has, hopefully, done that, like we’ve given these children an opportunity to see what we’ve achieved and want to go on and emulate it for themselves. I was 14 years old when I watched that 2005 Ashes series and it was hugely inspiring for me. Hopefully we can do something similar for the next generation now.”There are questions about whether the ECB’s new competition, The Hundred, which will dominate the 2020 season, is really going to be the best way to build on whatever surge of interest the sport enjoys this summer. But their CEO, Tom Harrison, did not want to front up and answer them right now, even though he was milling around on the outfield.Giles did though. “It is how it is,” he said, when he was asked how he felt that 50-over cricket was going to be marginalised next season. “I think next year is really exciting, and our focus will move towards 20-over cricket much more, because there are two T20 World Cups coming up, so for us having the preparation period of playing the T20 Blast and The Hundred is probably much more suited for what we’re taking on. And wouldn’t it be great if we could go and win that, too?”Who knows, if they do, maybe the ECB will throw a proper party for them, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/769b5f92a63b9d3ff9c90cea84e53d252cd3e2c7/0_58_3940_2364/master/3940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9067692a04391ea513e7c13092ac7e9e","title":"eoin morgan england to remain captain cricket world cup","story":"Eoin Morgan has been backed to remain as England captain for the foreseeable future after masterminding the World Cup victory that has sealed his place in the pantheon of British sporting immortals.As the ticker-tape settled in the aftermath of England’s historic win over New Zealand at Lord’s, the 32-year-old said he would take time away from the game to consider whether he will still be worth his place in the team in four years’ time.But before the next 50-over World Cup, due to be hosted by India in 2023, there is its Twenty20 equivalent in Australia late next year. And while England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, is due to end his stint after the upcoming Ashes series, he fancies Morgan will at least want to lead his side to a second trophy.“Morgs is the leader of not just the guys in the team but off the field as well. He is the one who has really driven this forward. I think the rest of the boys try and run through a brick wall for him and the effort that Ben Stokes put in yesterday was just an example of that.”Jos Buttler, whose sharp gather from Jason Roy’s throw ran out Martin Guptill and secured England’s first men’s World Cup, would be the natural successor to Morgan given his current status as vice-captain.If Morgan’s imprint on this England team is unquestionable, then so too is that of Bayliss. The Australian was hired back in 2015 by Andrew Strauss, then director of cricket, off the back of a strong white-ball CV in a bid to end England’s shambolic record at World Cups.Bayliss was not immediately sure if he could deliver on the brief but by empowering Morgan and creating a relaxed player-led environment, he now feels the end result has supported his commitment to aggressive, positive cricket.Bayliss said: “It’s justification for how we went about it for the last four years. At different times we have copped a bit of criticism but we had an end goal in mind and this is the result.Bayliss had no doubts over the talents of Ben Stokes, a player whose all-round skills and commitment to training would appeal to any coach. He stuck by him during his well-documented off-field troubles resulting from the 2017 Bristol incident and saw this rewarded with the unbeaten 84 that rescued England in the final. Bayliss said: “I don’t want this taken out of context but he is a real fighter. What he did yesterday was extraordinary.”Asked if he doubted Stokes could resurrect his career after Bristol, Bayliss replied: “If there was one guy who could come back from that sort of adversity he was the one. I’m really happy he was able to show what he can do on a big stage. He is a leader of people off the field as well and not just on it. He is a guy that a lot of people gravitate to. Everyone in the team is so happy for him.”Stokes, slightly bleary-eyed, ahead of the team’s visit to No 10 Downing Street, said: “We deserved to be in the final for what we’ve done over the last four years. We would have been devastated if we hadn’t managed to lift that trophy.“Everyone here deserves to feel like a champion because we’ve just won it but when it comes to the Ashes this summer, it’s going to be heads on because it has to be. We may be world champions but also want to be Ashes winners as well.”The turnaround is indeed a quick one, with a four-day Test versus Ireland at Lord’s starting a week on Wednesday before the five-match bid to regain the Ashes from Australia begins at Edgbaston on 1 August.England’s squads are due to be selected in the coming days ahead of a training camp at the FA’s St George’s Park this weekend. Some cross-format players may well be rested for Ireland’s inaugural Test in England, while there are also injuries to overcome.Mark Wood, an incumbent after his five-wicket haul in St Lucia during the winter, suffered a side strain during the final – the severity of which is not yet known – and Jofra Archer, surely a given to make the cut after an English record 20 wickets in the World Cup, nursed a similar complaint throughout the campaign.

After 10 races it is the strongest opening sequence of his career and increased the Mercedes driver’s imposing lead in the world championship standings.Having taken the flag at Silverstone the five-times world champion, who has often come into his own at this stage of the year, also ominously warned that he is now feeling hugely confident with his Mercedes car.Hamilton won at Silverstone – a record sixth victory in the British GP – beating his teammate Valtteri Bottas into second after the Finn had started from pole. Hamilton harried him fiercely in the opening laps but Bottas defended superbly. However when Hamilton opted for a one-stop strategy, with Bottas committed to taking two, the race swung in his favour. A free stop under the safety car meant he took the lead and he drove superbly to take his tyres to the finish.Hamilton now leads Bottas by 39 points in the title race which, with 11 meetings remaining, is now a straight fight between the two Mercedes drivers. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who was 16th at Silverstone after he took a penalty for crashing into Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, is 100 points behind and effectively out of contention.Hamilton has won four of the past five championships and believes each one has brought him on as a driver but insisted he would not stop looking to further improve.“Every year you get a bit more comfortable within yourself and within the methods you use and the processes you go through,” he said. “But qualifying’s not been spectacular this year, still not perfect, there’s still work to be done but the races have generally been relatively strong.”Mercedes have won all but one race this season and completed a remarkable seven one-two finishes. Their car has a comfortable edge over the rest of the field and Hamilton was relishing in its performance.“My trust in the car is incredibly high,” he said. “I know what the car is able to do and so I guess the experience of last year has made me a bit more confident to push it more, and being that it is so close I need to try and eke a bit more out of the car.”In the buildup to the race, Hamilton had bemoaned the clash with Wimbledon and the Cricket World Cup final but on the ground at least, the British GP boasted the most spectators with a sell-out crowd of 141,000 fans. It was announced last week that the British GP has renewed its contract to host Formula One for a further five years and the dates of the race will be under consideration. Those watching at Silverstone on Sunday were treated to a thrilling encounter, with close racing, overtaking and wheel to wheel contests across the field.Despite the intensity of some of the racing, particularly between Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Verstappen, the stewards deemed it all to be hard but fair and imposed only one penalty, on Vettel for his misjudgment which he admitted had been a mistake.The drivers welcomed this approach by the stewards. Hamilton too approved of them allowing a hands-off approach as long as the racing was clean. “That’s what everyone wants isn’t it?” he said. “Good for them, I’m glad it was a great day for the sport.”With Mercedes enjoying a strong advantage and Ferrari no closer to matching them, the Scuderia’s task looks increasingly to be battling a resurgent Red Bull. Verstappen is now a solid third in the championship, 13 points in front of Vettel. At Silverstone their race pace was impressive and Pierre Gasly, who has had a lacklustre season thus far, returned his equal best F1 finish with fourth and pulled a great move to pass Vettel during the race.Hamilton knows he is now in a two-way title fight but bemoaned the lack of a greater challenge at the front. “I love the racing, I do love the racing element, I loved competing against Ferrari last year. I wish the battle today was with the Ferraris. It’s different when you’re racing within a team and I much, much prefer it when you’re racing with the Red Bull and the Ferrari, but currently that’s not how it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf5ec698c6b076af40816aef721090c3c84c34a2/0_110_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d782e7860c7bddafc7779025c8bfa39e","title":"novak djokovic roger federer grand slam record","story":"Wimbledon champion says Swiss rival is an inspiration and he hopes that he will still be competing at the age of 37At the end of this seesawing and tempestous epic, which was not only the longest final in Wimbledon history but perhaps its most dramatic, Novak Djokovic pointed one finger to the sky in triumph. He might as well have been waving it in defiance at the Centre Court crowd, who had spent four hours and 57 minutes willing and baying Roger Federer to victory.Afterwards the Serb explained that he had tricked his mind so that every time he heard “Roger” he felt that people were actually cheering for him. “If you have the majority of the crowd on your side, it helps, it gives you motivation, it gives you strength, it gives you energy,” he admitted. “When you don’t, then you have to find it within. I like to transmutate it in a way. So when the crowd is chanting ‘Roger’ I hear ‘Novak’. It sounds silly but it is like that. I try to convince myself that it’s like that.”It was not the only trick Djokovic pulled off to win his fifth Wimbledon title. He was the worse player for four of the five sets. He did not conjure a break point until deep into the fourth. He was down two match points at 8-7 in the fifth. His opponent served better, volleyed better, returned better, hit 40 more winners and won 14 more points. And yet Djokovic still emerged victorious. Brad Gilbert once wrote a book called Winning Ugly. This was the director’s cut.Afterwards the Serb admitted he was on the back foot for most of the match. Yet the way he was able to raise his game in each of the three tie-breaks while Federer slipped into his shell was deeply impressive. Djokovic’s fifth Wimbledon symphony might have been discordant but in some ways it was his most glorious.It also enhances his bragging rights. For in the decades ahead, when talk turns to who was the greatest, Federer, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal know their names will be rattled out fast and furiously. But Djokovic now has 16 titles, closing in on Federer, who has 20, and Nadal, who has 18. And at 32 he knows that time is on his side.Afterwards he issued an ominous warning to his great rival. “Roger hopes to inspire people to keep going at 37,” he said. “I’m one of them. The fact that they have made history of this sport motivates me as well, inspires me to try to do what they have done, what they’ve achieved, and even more.”Federer made his aggressive attention clear in his opening service game, with two aces and a rasping forehand winner. The Swiss continued to have the better of the first set only to falter in the tie-break. The crowd were deflated. They, like everyone else, had felt that the best chance Federer had was to start fast. Yet he had other ideas, breaking immediately before racing way to win the second set 6-1 – the most lopsided set he had won against Djokovic for seven years.He continued to press. But Djokovic, tennis’s greatest wall, stubbornly refused to budge. Time and again he was like the superhero Plastic Man, whose malleable body allows him to stretch to impossible lengths, getting balls back that Federer thought had been dispatched for a winner. Another tie-break came. Again Federer faltered. Somehow, incredibly, Djokovic was a set from victory.Federer looked to be tiring. Yet again he picked himself up and, when Djokovic erred, he went for the jugular to go 5-2 up and win the set. As he hit the winning point the decibel levels inside Wimbledon went from 0-100 faster than any sports car.Up until now it had not always been a match of the greatest quality. But the final set, which lasted two hours and two minutes, became intensely gripping and grippingly tense. Djokovic broke early and went 4-2 ahead, yet when Federer broke back suddenly 10,000 people were standing and punching the air as if they were at a religious revival. Briefly it seemed as if they were.Of course the Centre Court crowd wanted Federer to win. Could one blame them? This could be the last chance they get to see him, a dominant presence at Wimbledon for 16 years, on the court he loves best. They were similarly supportive of Serena Williams on Saturday, knowing that genius – no matter how brightly it burns – eventually has to fade.It looked as if they were going to have their wishes granted when Federer had his 21st grand slam title on his racket at 8-7 and 40-15 up in the final set. Yet Djokovic, just like when he saved two match points against Federer in the US Open in 2011, had other ideas. The first was saved with a thumping service return to the body. The second by a sublime passing shot as the Swiss player rushed into the net. It is possible to wound Djokovic. But putting him away is another thing altogether.On the match went until it got to 12-12 and became the first singles match at Wimbledon to end on a tie-break. Once again Djokovic handled the pressure better.Federer tried to shrug off the defeat, saying: “Every loss hurts at Wimbledon but I am very strong at being able to move on. I don’t want to be depressed about an amazing tennis match.” But rarely has he looked more deflated.With this victory Djokovic extends his lead over Federer to 26-22. For good measure he has also now beaten him in three of their four matches on grass. And once again he did so almost alone, except for those inside his player’s box and a pocket of Serbian fans cheering him on. Not for the first time he proved impervious – and imperious."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2645d2d718c24e59c0ae70f99c6af6934956781/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a72909475a86596349c2f676d2330b8","title":"prix arc de triomphe ticket prices horse racing longchamp","story":"France Galop, French racing’s ruling body, will cut admission prices for this year’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe and “promise that every English racing fan should have a proper drink” if Enable wins her third Arc at Longchamp in October, following widespread criticism of the facilities and customer service at the track in 2018 after a €140m (£123m) redevelopment.Thousands of British and Irish racing fans make an annual pilgrimage to Paris on the first weekend in October for Europe’s richest and most prestigious race. Last year, though, many left bitterly disappointed and threatening never to return, amid reports of extended queues for toilets, betting windows, sandwich kiosks and bars, many of which seemed to run out of supplies by mid-afternoon.The problems arose despite an attendance of just 35,000 on Arc day, 20,000 fewer than saw Golden Horn’s victory in 2015 before the old Longchamp closed for redevelopment.Fans paid €20 (£17) to watch that race, and €30 (£26) when the Arc moved to Chantilly in 2016 and 2017. For the first Arc at the new Longchamp, however, the price was hiked to €75 (£68). That will drop to €65 (£57) this year, while admission to the Jardin de l’Arc enclosure – described as “the biggest pub in Paris” – will be €20 from €30.

A full house of 140,000 at Silverstone, Wimbledon packed for the men’s final, the entire nation taking advantage of the free-to-air concession to follow the twists and turns of an unprecedented cricket showdown at a sold-out Lord’s. Who, we asked ourselves, does this stuff better? And yet amid the unfolding delirium of Sunday’s sporting cavalcade there were moments when it was impossible not to pause the action and ask what it means, in the times through which we are living, to find a few hours’ relief by cheering a bunch of talented people hitting a ball or driving round in circles.Whoever and wherever you were, it was a glorious day. There may have been nothing quite like having a seat at Lord’s as the astonishing climax to the World Cup final went through its various stages of escalating delirium. But the real place to be was in England’s back garden, with family and friends and a big screen and a bucket full of iced drinks. Then, as an average sort of day was transformed by golden late-afternoon sunlight, you could watch and marvel at it all, surfing on one wave of emotion after another.The TV cameras captured the enthusiasm of all those crowds, from the grassy mounds to the royal box. But that’s where Stormzy, Jeff Bezos, Sharron Davies, Daniel Craig, Seb Coe, Clare Foy, John Bercow and those nice Cambridges and Cumberbatches got it wrong. It was good to see them all showing up at a major sporting event. But they’d have been better off in a T-shirt and shorts in the back garden, soaking everything up at once, gripped by the dizzying crescendo of a unique day.It’s not necessary to claim that a record-breaking sixth victory at Silverstone makes Lewis Hamilton the greatest grand prix driver of all time or that the first Wimbledon men’s singles final to be decided by a fifth-set tie break was the greatest tennis match in history or that by fighting each other to the very end England and New Zealand had produced the greatest cricket match ever played. Probably none of those things is true. But we can be pretty certain that there has never been an all-round day quite like this one, when events followed each other in a way that otherwise happens only during an Olympic Games, with its formal and interlinked structure.The Olympics was the comparison that also came to mind while observing the joy of the crowds at all three places. Seven years ago this month Britain became the sporting centre of the world when London hosted the Summer Games. Immoderate expenditure and matching inventiveness allowed the country to show its best side, starting with an opening ceremony in which Danny Boyle brilliantly reacquainted us with our history, our ersity and our moral assets. For two weeks we were enraptured not just by the athletes’ achievements but by a comforting sense that we had recognised our better selves, despite the austerity measures newly imposed on British lives by the men occupying the best seats in the stadium.All things pass, we told ourselves. The Camerons and Osbornes will fade into history but our real values and principles, ancient and modern, will endure. Look at Jess Ennis, a mixed race woman from Sheffield. Look at Bradley Wiggins, born in Ghent and now enthroned at Hampton Court Palace. Look at Mo Farah, a refugee from Mogadishu. The future is right there, enfolded in a union flag, and it wasn’t formed on the playing fields of Eton. That’s what we said as the cheers faded on the last of those wonderful summer evenings, before the daily grind resumed.One Olympic cycle later a truer picture of Britain’s essential nature emerged through the result of the EU referendum, and Sunday’s events took place against the backdrop of a nation more deeply ided than ever, readier to turn disagreement into hatred and anger into violence. In such an environment even the bliss of a first win for England in a Cricket World Cup final could not feel entirely unmixed.No response to that triumph was more self-revealing in its stupidity, ignorance and opportunism than that of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who took to Twitter to proclaim that “we clearly don’t need Europe to win”. There are three answers to that. First, “we” don’t need Europe to win the Eton wall game, either. Second, the Ryder Cup. Third, he seemed not to have noticed that the squad deemed worthy of his accolade contains a host of players with immigrant backgrounds, including men born in Dublin, Christchurch, Bridgetown and Durban, and with skin shades and cultural affiliations reflecting what anyone can see on a walk through the ordinary streets of Britain. They don’t represent some utopian Rainbow Britain but they do represent the us that history has fashioned and which is under attack from those with a different agenda.For the participants the glow of that magical day will never fade. The rest of us can also cherish the memories and the sense of pride – not just in the prizes won in our name but in the knowledge that the stage and the audience proved worthy of the occasion. Hamilton and the England XI were inevitably cheered to the echo and beyond but Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, a Serb and a Swiss, could not have wished for a finer setting for their efforts or a warmer embrace from the crowd. It took all sorts, not least New Zealand’s widely appreciated sportsmanship, to create that day of marvels, allowing us another glimpse of our better selves. By the time the next one arrives the need might be even greater."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7913bc8469b82a3b4aa74dbc9eafcc5cbd169ac/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48ed7fe944fcafb41acb0b2f9ee49d33","title":"tour de france 2019 stage ten live","story":"A split in the peloton meant several GC contenders lost almost two minutes as Team Jumbo-Visma’s young Belgian won a bunch sprint in Albi Van Aert wins a stage on his maiden Tour. The young Belgian went early, about 250m from the line and was able to hang on to win by a couple of centimetres despite a powerful late surge from Elia Viviani, who looked thoroughly disgusted himself as he crossed the line. Van Aert has never competed in a race of longer than seven stages in length before this Tour. He has already spent time in the white jersey for best young rider and now has a stage win to his name. Pinot loses 1min 40sec: Thibaut Pinot, Rigoberto Uran, Richie Porte, Jakob Fuglsang and Alexey Lutsenko roll over the line, having lost 1min 40sec on their GC rivals. The 24 year old Belgian wins the stage. I think Wout van Aert has got up to win it for Team Jumbo-Visma. 500m to go: Sunweb continue their lead out, with one and then another rider peeling off the front. 1km to go: Sunweb have four riders in front of Matthews at the sharp end of the race, with Caleb Ewan and Peter Sagan lurking with intent behind them. 2.7km to go: Deceuninck-Quick Step step up the already relentless pace at the front, hoping to get Elia Viviani to the front in the final 200 metres. The yellow jersey group lead the Pinot group by 1min 08sec. Team Sunweb are also forming an orderly queue, preparing themselves to lead out Michael Matthews. 5km to go: The gap from the yellow jersey group to the Pinot group increases to 1min 04sec. Mikel Landa is a further 30 seconds back. 7km to go: Movistar’s riders drop back to try to limit the damage for Mikel Landa, leaving Nairo Quintana and Ernesto Valverde to fend for themselves in the yellow jersey group, where Team Ineos continue to put the hammer down. There is some confusion about the whereabouts of Caleb Ewan, who is only a slip of a lad and difficult to pick out. 13km to go: The Pinot group is now 46 seconds behind the yellow jersey. At the front of the course, along with Julian Alaphilippe, Team Ineos are shovelling coal into the furnace in an effort to end the challenge of several struggling GC contenders. In terms of potential stage winners, Alexander Kristoff and Matteo Trentin are also well positioned, along with Elia Viviani, Sonny Colbrelli, Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews. 14km to go: Caleb Ewan, Elia Viviani and Peter Sagan are all in the front group and seem the most likely contenders to contest the sprint. Ewan, in particular, could really do with a win. Having already used up their domestiques, the big-hitters in the PinotUranPorteFuglsang group are now 28 seconds behind the leaders. Vincenzo Nibali has been dropped to the third group on the road. They’ve shot their bolt, the gap is widening and the riders in the yellow jersey group are working hard to pile on the hurt. 19km to go: The Pinot group has closed the gap to 13 seconds after a heroic dig at the front by Astana’s Alexey Lutsenko. Now Richie Porte takes over. 2okm to go: Yup, Fuglsang is in the second group, which is currently 29 seconds behind the yellow jersey group and losing more time. Team Jumbo-Visma’s George Bennett is in the third group, which is 1min 38sec behind the yellow jersey. The breakaway has been caught: That was inevitable, but the big news at the moment is that the peloton has split into three parts and several big names have been caught in the second group, which is 25 seconds behind the first. Porte, Pinot and Uran are among them. There is a suggestion, as yet unconfirmed, that Astana’s Jakob Fuglsang may also have been caught out. An email: “Biscuits in the US are kind of like fluffy, less dense scones but without the fruit,” writes Paul Fox. |Bojangles are pretty good but Popeye’s are better, with spicier Cajun chicken.” “The US South prides itself on fluffy, delicious buttermilk biscuits,” writes Rory Kramer. “It’s a soft, leavened bread that’s often super buttery yet somehow also light. Biscuits are glorious and Bojangles is a great chain and I say this as someone who has never lived in the south but acknowledges the gloriousness that is fried chicken and biscuits.”29km to go: Correction: Thibaut Pinot, Giulio Ciccone, Vicenzo Nibali, Richie Porte and Fabio Aru have all missed the split and are on the chase in the second of the three groups the peloton split into a few moments ago. 30km to go: The relentless pace at the front of prompts the peloton to fracture into three different groups. EF Education First rider Rigoberto Uran looks to have been caught out. All the rest of the GC contenders are well placed in the front of the three groups. 35km to go: Several riders are dropped off the back of the peloton as race leader Julian Alaphilippe puts in a big turn on the front of the bunch, alongside Elia Viviani. The gap is in to 56 seconds. The bunch is currently booting along at 46km per hour, compared to the breakaway’s 44.6km per hour. That’s quick. 36km to go: The gap from the six-man breakaway to the bunch is 1min 26sec. By my estimation, between Friday’s stage and today’s stage, I have now done 10 hours worth of consecutive Tour de France live blogging, in which precisely little or nothing of interest has happened for nine hours and 58 minutes.Fight! Fight! Fight! “Responding to John O’G’s anti-Bojangles slander on the Tour live blog,” writes Kyle Taylor. “Chicken and biscuits are great, whatever the elitist guy John O’G says. Bojangles biscuits especially are incredible. Definitely one of the better fast food restaurants in the US. “I hate Trump but sports stadium branding has literally nothing to do with where candidates have rallies. This particular coliseum is in Charlotte, North Carolina which is a very important place for campaigns to go.” Chicken and ... biscuits? Somebody is going to have to talk the rest of the class how that works. What kind of biscuits? Of course, here in Blighty, biscuits are what Americans call “cookies”. I’m guessing nobody is going to Bojangles for a feed of roast chicken and chocolate Hob Nobs or Custard Creams. 52km to go: Several teams take the opportunity to have unofficial feed zones in place for the peloton as they make their way up the final climb. I will take this opportunity to have a short, unofficial break of my own before we get to the business end of the stage. The gap is two minutes, I’ll be back in about five. 53km to go: The gap goes back out to 1min 34sec as the breakaway group hit the top of the day’s final climb. For the fourth time today, Natnael Berhane leads the escape party over the top. He’s in fifth place in the King of the Mountains standings. Behind them, the peloton is back together, although Ryan Zabel and Yeann Offredo have been dropped. 58km to go: The peloton splits up as Team Ineos up the pace at the front and the crosswinds buffet the bunch. A group of 30 or so riders - among them, polka dot jersey Tim Wellens - are now 30 seconds behind the yellow jersey group. The gap from our six-man breakaway to the yellow jersey is now a mere 40 seconds. An email: “On the subject of you looking up Deceuninck,” writes John O’G. “I used to watch Nascar and there was one race that was sponsored by Bojangles. I looked it up expecting it to be some sort of gentlemen’s club but it was, in fact, a fast food shop whose specialty was ‘chicken and biscuit’. Chicken and biscuit! Needless to say I did not frequent that establishment when I was in the States.” I think Donald Trump staged one of his rallies at a place called the Bojangles Coliseum, which is another reason not to patronise the restaurant of the same name. Gareth Thomas responds: “I have not attempted to throw a kettle over a pub while riding at 60 mph down the south side of the St Gotthard pass,” he concedes. “But I’m sure there are many reasons why this could prove unhelpful behaviour on Swiss roads.” 69km to go: Team Ineos are leading the charge in the peloton, as the teams of various GC contenders move to the front of the peloton, alert to the dangers of crosswinds on the exposed, narrow road they’re travelling along. The gap is 1min 07sec. 72km to go: Yoann Offredo is currenbtly struggling to stay in touch with the peloton. The Wanty-Gobert rider spent much of last week in breakaways, but has been feeling poorly for the past couple of days. Nearby at the back of the bunch, polka-dot jersey Tim Wellens has dropped back to his team car to get some ice to stuff down the back of his shirt. Some correspondence: “In response to Gareth Thomas clocking 60mph on a steel-framed racing bike with small touring panniers on the fast downhill run south of the St Gotthard pass some years ago,” writes Craig Fawcett. “I’ve got a mate who once threw a kettle over a pub.” “Re: the optimum point, due to drag, when Gareth Thomas cannot go any faster downhill,” writes Nic Clarke, who is a science teacher. “That would be, as my year 9 class could tell you, your terminal velocity. Well at least half of them. Probably.” A question: “What do you think is next for Cav?” asks Lloyd. “Do you think he can come back next year (and motivated as never) or is it the end of an era?” It’s a good question and a difficult one to answer, not least because he was suffering a debilitating virus for much of last year. He’s not getting any younger and there are some speedy young bucks in the ranks that are probably faster than him, but he may well have a couple more Tour stage wins left in his legs. He’d certainly have fancied his chances today, if he hadn’t been controversially dropped by Team Dimension Data the week before the Tour commenced. 86km to go: With six lots of points already snaffled, Sonny Colbrelli is the first man from the peloton to roll over the line, shadowed by Peter Sagan a few metres behind. The gap from the breakaway group to the bunch is now 1min 33sec. 88km to go: Odd Christian Eiking is first over the line at a decidedly uncontested intermediate sprint. Anthony Turgis is second and Mads Wurtz Schmidt is third. Intermediate sprint: The breakaway is approaching La Primaube, the secen of today’s intermediate sprint. While none of the chaps in today’s breakaway are in contention for the green jersey, there are cash prizes up for grabs for the teams of the first three riders over the line. First gets €1,500, second trousers €1,000 and third gets €500. Behind the breakaway, Peter Sagan already has his customary stranglehold on the green jersey and leads Michael Matthews by 60 points. Sagan has 204 points, Matthews has 144 poiunts, Sonny Colbrelli is third on 129, one point ahead of Elia Viviani.93km to go: The field passes through the small southern city of Rodez, which isn’t too far from Carcassone, Toulouse and Montpelier on the map.An email: “Cav’s got Quick Step in his house,” writes Matthew Trim, sending this report veering perilously close to Hello! magazine territory, as we step inside Mark Cavendish’s well appointed Tuscany villa. An email: “Max Richez was clocked at 96.7kph which sounds like a lot,” writes Gareth Thomas. “It is roughly 60.5mph. I clocked 60mph on a steel-framed racing bike with small touring panniers on the fast downhill run south of the St Gotthard pass some years ago. There is an optimum point, due to drag, when you cannot go any faster. Panniers don’t help either!”103km to go: The gap continues to hove between two and three minutes and is currently at 2min 37sec. Michael Schar (CCC), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) are the men in front and the intermediate sprint is next on their agenda, although they may pass through the feed zone first, if they haven’t done so already. 107km to go: And Quick Step make laminated flooring. I knew that already. 110km to go: Curiosity finally having got the better of me, I have discovered that Deceuninck, of Deceuninck-Quick Step fame, make sustainable PVC windows and doors. By their own account, their “heritage flush and sculptured sash windows look great in any surrounding, from country cottages to modern townhouses. Their subtle charm and elegance will transform your home. The collection is ideal for period properties and for those who want to add or restore character to their homes with its unique, unrivalled, aesthetics and sympathetic symmetrical design giving a property perfect balance and harmony”. Yep, it’s come to this.

Yeah, I’ll let you through.’”The film, Filth \u0026amp Wisdom, wasn’t too well received, alas. But being handpicked by Madonna for her directorial debut – McClure must have felt she was about to make it? “When you’re young,” says the actor, her blue eyes widening, “it’s hard because your expectations are so high. Just having so much rejection, I’d built quite a thick skin. Even so I was like, ‘This is it, I know it.’ And it wasn’t, again.”It’s safe to say McClure has made it now. We are sitting in a fancy London hotel and, last night, she was at a screening of her latest drama, though she insists: “I don’t want to feel that relaxed about things. I live in the real world and I don’t take things for granted.” As the newly promoted DI Kate Fleming in the BBC’s Line of Duty juggernaut, McClure reached a prime-time audience, and her recent documentary, Our Dementia Choir, was one of the most affecting TV shows of the year. Now she’s about to star in a standalone film, one of three dramas in an anthology for Channel 4, created with writer and director Dominic Savage.Her film, I Am Nicola, is about a disintegrating relationship set against a background of coercive control. When Savage asked what kind of story she’d like to do, McClure said a drama about a relationship. “I’m fascinated by them,” she says. “It’s such a massive part of who you are, and it’s destructive – and it’s amazing. I had ideas about what I wanted that to feel and look like. I love watching people doing really boring, normal stuff. Dominic’s brave enough to do that, to capture it.”Nicola is a hairdresser while her boyfriend (Perry Fitzpatrick) has an office job, and their relationship begins to feel suffocating. Some of I Am Nicola is based on McClure’s own experiences: “Jealousy and trust issues. It can be quite isolating and you don’t really know you’re in it when you’re in it.” These previous relationships weren’t abusive, though, as Nicola’s is. “It was just being young – two people not really knowing how to have an adult relationship.”Savage worked out the scenes, but the dialogue was improvised. “You’ll see a scene that could last two minutes but we’ve spent 20 minutes beforehand and after developing it, so it feels like you’ve got a lot of raw emotion. It’s interesting. I like working that way.” McClure has known Fitzpatrick since she was 11, when they both attended Nottingham’s drama group, the Television Workshop, where improvisation was a key part.McClure grew up in the city, where her dad was a joiner and her mum a hairdresser. She wanted to be a dancer, but when she got a place at drama school acting took over her life. “I felt such freedom, made a great bunch of friends, created drama and plays. My head just spun.”When she was 14, she got a place at London’s Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, but her parents couldn’t afford to send her. (Years later, she found letters they had written to the council and arts organisations pleading for donations.) “I didn’t really know what I was missing so it was fine. Looking back, you kind of go, ‘It wasn’t meant to be.’” And anyway, the workshop was brilliant. “It was a bit of a shithole, really,” she says, laughing. “That’s what I loved about it. There was this little dungeon of props and costumes – and they were minging. There were battered old settees we’d pull into scenes. There was stuff everywhere.”It wasn’t precious: everything could be ripped up or painted. She loved being able to swear in character, a novelty for a kid. “You couldn’t be told off. There was no judgment. It was free, so you had everybody from all walks of life, all ethnicities, all classes. It was the most incredible place because you were judged purely on your talent.”McClure did live in London for a while. “I always said I can’t stay here because …” She pauses, then becomes deadly serious. “I begrudge paying that much for a pint. It really does piss me off. My life is not predominantly my work. Jonny and my family and friends are my priority. I have a great opportunity to dip my toe into London, get loads of stuff done, and then I go home.”McClure’s first proper job was in Shane Meadows’s comedy-drama A Room for Romeo Brass, when she was 15. “I genuinely thought it was big-time,” she says, smiling again. “It was shown in Nottingham and all my mates went to see it. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m in a film! My life’s going to change overnight!’ Later I was told it was shown at six cinemas across the country. But in my head, it was everywhere – it was in America, they were going to discover me, Julia Roberts was going to want to cast me in her next film. I was young, really naive.”Meadows cast her again in his film This Is England, and she reprised her role as skinhead Lol for the TV spin-offs, one of which won her a Bafta. She had been working since she was 16 in shops and offices, throughout these early roles. “I do remember saying to them, ‘If it all goes wrong, can I come back?’” McClure, now 36, has been vocal about the lack of acting opportunities for those from lower-income families. “I think people think I’m against people who are privileged, and I’m not. I’m privileged now, to be able to pay my bills and do the work I do.” But “from what I hear, they are cutting drama and arts in schools and train fares aren’t getting cheaper”. It’s hard to afford last-minute trips to London when an audition comes up, she explains, “and people are struggling to join drama schools because of their financial situation”.McClure has set up a production company “to focus on working-class drama and comedy. I’m interested in stories I can relate to. It’s not always dark, it doesn’t always have to be a complete tragedy. And trying to get directors who are from a similar world – because it’s all right saying we’ve got this brilliant script, but all of a sudden you’ve got somebody directing it who’s not from that world. That can be tricky.”Although she has never experienced the sort of #MeToo harassment other women have spoken out about, she has experienced sexism. Or as she puts it: “I have experienced some right twats, as in men who treat men differently to how they treat me.” Things such as a male actor being asked if he is happy to start a scene “and I’m stood in the room at the same time. I’m like, ‘Yeah and I’m also happy to go.’ It’s little things like that, which you might think are nothing, but you’re offending me by not asking me. I am quite strong and to some people I might seem a little cocky, but if I’ve got an opinion I like it to be heard. That’s not me trying to be difficult. I’ve seen too many men walk into the room and go, ‘What’s happening?’ And then you do it as a woman and you feel like you’re being difficult.”She’d like to have a go at directing, and has one project “bubbling away”. In the meantime, is she having to plan her life around Line of Duty? “There’s nothing to plan around so I’m kind of ignoring it.” The sixth series has been commissioned but she doesn’t know any more than that. “No one’s got anything to tell us. Nothing’s been written.”When it started, they had no idea what a hit it would become. “Not in a million years. There’s nobody at the top telling you, ‘We’re going to make sure this is a success.’ It’s the audience who decides that, and that’s what I love about it.” She puts its success down to Jed Mercurio’s writing, but also to casting decisions – a mix of big names such as Thandie Newton, with surprising roles for, say, Neil Morrissey, more often seen in comedy. Even McClure and Compston were relatively unknown indie actors when the series began. “Totally,” she says. “I was a Shane Meadows kid, he was a Ken Loach kid. We’re these indie actors you wouldn’t think you’d trust with a BBC cop show.”McClure seems to approach her career with a simple combination of gratitude and hard work. “I have been lucky. I’ve lost jobs I’ve desperately wanted. I’ve gained jobs that became what I never expected them to become.” Trying to make it big in the US has never been a priority – she has never even been to Los Angeles, she says, then laughs at my disbelieving expression.“That’s the reaction I get,” she says. “What am I going to do? Go and knock on doors? I’ve done that since I was 11. It’s not that I don’t want to try it and do other things but I don’t know if, at 36, I’ve got the patience to sell myself again.” She smiles brightly. “I love British TV, I love British film. I like where I live and the work I get.”• I Am Nicola is on Channel 4 on 23 July at 10pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0bd1ee209cf6cbc3a4669c849b0b02b767a20/0_11_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f5c82086065fccbde3fd5d4433d97","title":"why are we like this the psychology of procrastination","story":"From deleting social media apps to setting limits on your screen time – here’s how to deal with the existential malaise of putting off the important thingsYou know that thing you’ve been putting off doing? Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible.

For a monthly fee of 2,000 yen, the firm offers a standard car for as little as 200 yen for 15 minutes.Anecdotal evidence suggests some users are taking advantage of the service’s low cost and convenience to nap while doing the rounds of client meetings on business trips or to escape bosses and other colleagues during lunch breaks. There has been a rise in the number of services – from karaoke to dining\u0026nbsp– catering to the solo customer.The need for a restorative daytime snooze is clear. One survey conducted using fitness trackers in 28 countries found that Japanese men and women slept on average for just six hours and 35 minutes a night – 45 minutes less than the international average. That made them the most sleep-deprived of all the nations surveyed, a phenomenon blamed partly on punishing working hours and long commutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af2c0eb2bc8736bf00c1677c945f4aefaed44260/16_0_4499_2700/master/4499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1542b6bd688557d09126ffb771957d32","title":"canada italian internment camps apology history","story":"Trudeau reopened a wound for families with his promise to apologize for the internment of hundreds during the second world warOn a rainy summer evening, Canadian federal police entered a social club in the city of Windsor and arrested bartender Michele Iannetta. Bewildered, he and others were rounded up and brought down to the local armoury.The police then descended on Ianetta’s house, where his wife, Antonia, and son, Guido, watched, frozen with fear, as officers rifled through the family’s belongings for evidence of his political sympathiesA naturalized Canadian citizen whose two brothers were serving in the Canadian military, Michele did not return home that night or the next he was eventually released four years later. He was never accused of any crime.“When something like that like happens, your neighbours look through curtains at what’s going on. There was a great deal of shame involved,” said Susan Iannetta, Michele’s granddaughter.The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, recently reopened bitter memories for Italian Canadians with a promise to formally apologize for what many consider a longstanding injustice: the detention and internment of hundreds of Italian Canadians during the second world war.“We have to face the dark chapter in our country’s history … Italian Canadians have lived with these memories for many years and deserve closure,” he told reporters. “It was a time when their patriotism was questioned and their lives thrown into chaos.”For decades, the Italian community has called on the government to recognize that it acted improperly when it detained hundreds of Italian Canadians, some of whom were Canadian citizens.Canada passed the War Measures Act in June 1940 after Italy declared war on the UK. The statute gave the government wide latitude to carry out surveillance on the estimated 31,000 Italians deemed “enemy aliens” in Canada, as fears of fascist sympathizers took hold.Police quickly cast a wide net: compiling lists of Italian men who were part of known fascist organizations – but also those whose only affiliations were to Italian social clubs.“There likely were some fascists with Italian passports in Canada,” said Raymond Culos, author of Injustice Served, a history of the internment. “The ones that really suffered where those who were just decent Italians living in Canada without any ulterior motive. But in 1940, the allies did not know what the future held.”In total, 634 men were picked up by the police. The average time in detention was 15 months, said Culos.Thousands more were forced to undergo a monthly registration process, checking in with the federal police to verify their address, said Culos. “In the words of one of the people I interviewed: ‘I was mortified.’ This woman she felt she was a Canadian and had been all her life.”Michele was eventually shuttled to Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and later to the city of Fredericton, where most of the men were held. He was unable to see his wife and three children for years – first because of restrictions, and later because of the cost.Michele only began speaking about his experiences in the camp in the two years before he died in 1973, said Susan.The internment of Italian Canadians came nowhere near the scope of Japanese Canadian detention, in which the entire population of residents – many of whom were Canadian citizens – were rounded up and sent to detention camps.But Canada apologized to Japanese Canadians in 1988 – and provided redress for internment and the seizure of private property – while successive governments have resisted formally apologizing for Italian internment, partly due to fears of liability. In 1990, the then prime minister, Brian Mulroney, offered a “full and unqualified apology for the wrongs done to our fellow Canadians of Italian origin”, but not in parliament. Trudeau’s government says it intends to issue a former apology in parliament, but has not offered a firm timeline.None of the people detained were ever charged with a crime, nor were they given access to a lawyer, said Culos. “Canadians of Italian origin, whose fathers and grandfathers were among those who were incarcerated, could be quite upset. Mr Trudeau’s statement will ease the pain for them, and I think they’re deserving enough of that kind of relief.”Susan Iannetta questioned the aim – and timing – of the apology.“It’s too late,” she said. “You can’t wipe away the shame.

About 700 people have recovered from infections.The latest official statistics list a total of 2,489 cases, of which 2,395 are confirmed. Twelve new cases were confirmed over the weekend and there were 10 deaths.The confirmed case announced late on Sunday in eastern Congo involves a pastor who became ill on Tuesday and sought treatment at a registered health centre. It is thought he was receiving care from a nurse at his accommodation in Butembo but decided to leave the city, and arrived at a health centre in Goma, North Kivu province, on Sunday showing symptoms of Ebola.The 46-year-old did not show signs of illness at three medical checkpoints on the 18-hour journey, though he gave different names, indicating a desire to hide his identity, officials said. He has now been sent back to Butembo for further care.While in Butembo, the pastor held regular services in seven churches, during which he laid his hands on worshippers, including people who were ill, the health ministry said.Officials called on local communities to take precautions such as washing their hands and avoiding physical contact with anyone suspected of contamination with the virus.The number of people moving around or through the zone worst hit by Ebola has been a big challenge for health services. Another problem has been attacks against health workers and treatment facilities. On Monday the health ministry said two Ebola awareness workers had been killed in the affected zone.Eastern DRC is home to a myriad of armed groups, and Mai Mai militia fighters are active near the hardest-hit towns. Health teams have been unable to access areas affected by violence to vaccinate people at risk of infection and to bring infected patients into isolation.At other times the violence against health teams has come from residents who do not want their loved ones taken to treatment centres or buried in accordance with guidelines aimed at reducing Ebola transmission.Health experts have long feared that the disease could make its way to Goma, which is located on the Rwandan border and is traversed by large numbers of travellers from across a vast area.The health ministries in DRC’s neighbours have been preparing for months for the possibility of cases, and frontline health workers have been vaccinated.While the experimental vaccine is believed to have saved countless lives, not all Congolese people have accepted it. Some falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because people can still develop the disease after getting the shot if they already had been infected.Peter Piot, who co-discoverer of the Ebola virus and has been a leading authority on the outbreaks since, called for “improved coordination, high-level political support, and urgent unified action” in the handling of the DRC epidemic.Speaking before a high-level United Nations and World Health Organization meeting in Geneva, he said: “There is no evidence that the end of this devastating epidemic is in sight. Rather, there is a real risk that this epidemic could further expand.”Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it much regretted the decision of the Congolese health minister to rule out the the WHO-recommended use of a second vaccine in North Kivu.“It is hard to understand why such a decision was taken, going so far as to ban any research on investigational Ebola vaccines in the country during this outbreak,” he said. “DRC has been a leader in innovation during Ebola outbreaks, and should remain at the forefront of research and innovation in this area.”LSHTM has been supporting the efforts in DRC to control the virus.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54cd855fc7cf4698c78a290dc8958cab2026c346/0_414_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb9d811345b9d17174d8431613597727","title":"france demands access to academic fariba adelkhah held in iran","story":"Fariba Adelkhah, who wrote Being Modern in Iran, was arrested in June, reports sayFrance has demanded immediate consular access to a senior French-Iranian academic who has been arrested in Iran.Fariba Adelkhah, a prominent researcher in anthropology and social sciences based at the Paris political institute Sciences Po, is believed to have been arrested in June.The detention risks increasing tension between Paris and Tehran at a critical moment in the crisis over Iran’s nuclear deal. European foreign ministers were meeting in Brussels on Monday in an attempt to preserve the deal, which the US abandoned unilaterally a year ago leading to an accelerating reciprocal withdrawal by Iran.The French foreign ministry said it had not yet been given “satisfactory” information on the status of Adelkhah, who is seen as one of France’s top academics on Iran.“The French authorities were recently informed of the arrest of Fariba Adelkhah,” the the foreign ministry said in a statement. “France calls on the Iranian authorities to shed full light on Mrs Adelkhah’s situation and repeats its demands, particularly with regard to an immediate authorisation for consular access. No satisfactory response has been received until now.”Adelkhah is best known for her book Being Modern in Iran, about changes in the country after the 1979 Islamic revolution.Sciences Po, the elite political science institute where Abdelkhah works, confirmed her arrest but refused to comment.Iranian opposition websites abroad have said Abdelkhah disappeared in June. Iran’s state-run Irna news agency quoted a government spokesman as saying on Sunday that a dual national had been arrested, without elaborating. The spokesman, Ali Rabiei, said he could not confirm any information.Adelkhah is the latest Iranian national also holding a western passport to be arrested in Iran. The UK has advised dual nationals against travel to Iran, saying the “dangers they face include arbitrary detention and lack of access to basic legal rights”.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been jailed in Tehran since 2016 on espionage charges. Dual Iranian-American nationals Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer, are serving 10-year sentences for espionage in a case that has outraged Washington.Meanwhile, Xiyue Wang, a Chinese-American researcher at Princeton University, is serving a 10-year sentence for espionage, and a US national, Michael White, 46, was this year sentenced to 10 years.A French academic, Clotilde Reiss, was detained in Iran for 10 months in 200910 before being released in a case that attracted widespread attention at the time.At a similar time to Reiss’s release, French judicial authorities set free Ali Vakili Rad, who had been convicted of the 1991 murder outside Paris of the ousted shah’s former prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar. The timing led to speculation that a deal may have been struck between the countries over the prisoners, though French authorities denied any exchange.As news of the detention broke, European foreign ministers were fighting to save the Iran nuclear deal, following Teheran’s announcements earlier this month that it would boost the enrichment level of uranium above agreed limits, breaking the terms of the landmark accord.Arriving in Brussels on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said there was a “closing but small window” to keep the deal alive. The foreign secretary warned that if Tehran acquired nuclear weapons, other countries in the region would too, leading to a “very toxic and dangerous situation”.The EU hopes it can persuade Iran to return to the deal, without triggering an investigation into Teheran’s decision to breach terms by enriching uranium.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said none of the parties to the agreement had signalled their intention to invoke a clause triggering an investigation for non-compliance.“All the steps that have been taken are reversible, so we hope and we invite Iran to reverse these steps and go back to full compliance with the agreement,” she said.As punishing US economic sanctions hit Iran’s economy, the EU has been attempting to craft a barter mechanism to allow European companies to continue trading with Iran.So far, 10 EU member states have agreed to take part in the Instex barter system, which allows companies to trade without money changing hands, in an attempt to avoid falling foul of US sanctions.Mogherini said the EU had not expected these measures would compensate Iran for economic losses incurred by the US decision to withdraw from the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8c45107feffe1a458436ec8aa36436c13e4f49/0_433_4464_2679/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f811fdc9640b739ccbe6adc836b4fbce","title":"jacob zuma south africa corruption inquiry","story":"Former president faces allegations he presided over vast corruption networkSouth Africa’s former president Jacob Zuma has told a judicial inquiry into corruption allegations that he is the victim of a plot by foreign intelligence agencies to seek his downfall.Speaking on the first day of five days of testimony, Zuma denied he had presided over an immense system of corruption and patronage that drained billions from the country’s exchequer.Zuma was ousted last year after almost a decade in power, following a bitter internal battle within the ruling African National Congress party. He faces hours of questioning by Raymond Zondo, a senior judge, mandated to investigate allegations of “state capture” in South Africa during his presidency.In hearings on Monday morning, Zuma claimed two foreign intelligence agencies had recruited spies within the ANC as part of a scheme to control South Africa and that the inquiry was designed to smear him.The inquiry was set up after an ombudsman’s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers – Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta – and senior officials in Zuma’s administration.The report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies had acted improperly.Among the cases it reviewed was an allegation by the then deputy finance minister that the Guptas had offered to secure him his boss’s job, as well as claims that Zuma had directed state firms to award tenders to companies owned by the family.Zuma has said the three Gupta brothers are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship.The Gupta family denied the accusations and left South Africa around the time that Zuma was ousted.The inquiry has also heard a series of further serious allegations from witnesses in recent months, describing massive bribes paid to officials by businesses seeking favours.Throughout the day, the 77-year-old Zuma and his lawyers continued to portray the him as a victim. “I have been provoked and provoked to the last degree … My own family suffers … people forget that I have a family who do not want to hear lies about me,” he said.Zuma said he could trace the conspiracy against him to the early 1990s, when he received an intelligence report that two foreign intelligence agencies “from big countries” and a branch of the apartheid government had come up with a strategy to get rid of him.“They took a decision that Zuma must be removed from the decision-making structures of the ANC. That’s why the character assassination, that is the beginning of the process that has put me where I am today,” Zuma saidAfter the hearing, he addressed hundreds of supporters who had gathered outside the offices of the inquiry in Johannesburg.Some wore military fatigues emblazoned with the emblem of the former armed wing of the ANC shouted: “Hands off Zuma!”Natasha Mazzone, a senior parliamentarian with the opposition Democratic Alliance party, said Zuma was trying to whitewash serious allegations: “The fact that we’ve heard a conspiracy theory dating back to 1990 is proof that the real truth is going to take a long time to extract.”There have been fears that Zuma will use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, who led the ANC to a convincing election victory in May but has so far been unable to fully assert his authority over the party.Observers say Ramaphosa needs to move quickly to root out entrenched networks of patronage and graft, often involving iniduals who owe senior positions within the party or public administration to Zuma.Zuma faces a separate corruption investigation involving 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa’s armed forces in 1994. He denies the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac39f164eeca2bea01e240d6c79cb8631140d799/64_282_4077_2447/master/4077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5fbc2a62984bc254692a8d50393549e","title":"ursula von der leyen makes final pledges secure eu top job","story":"Candidate to lead European commission seeks to win over MEPs and seal knife-edge voteThe woman seeking to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as the European commission president has made last-minute pledges on the climate crisis, Brexit, an EU minimum wage and gender quotas for company boards as she faces a knife-edge vote on her candidacy.In leaked letters to the leaders of two of the EU parliament’s main political groups, Ursula von der Leyen, who was nominated two weeks ago by the heads of state and government for the top EU post, has sought to win over critical left-leaning MEPs at the risk of alienating some on the right.The German defence minister’s candidacy is facing opposition from the Social Democrats (SPD) in her own country, the greens and the hard left, among others, in the vote on Tuesday evening in which she needs to secure an absolute majority to become the first ever female commission president.Some are opposed to Von der Leyen on the grounds that she is not one of the spitzenkandidaten, or lead candidates, who campaigned ahead of May’s European elections to head up the EU’s executive branch.The Spitzenkandidaten process is a method by which the European Parliament seeks to influence who is appointed as President of the European Commission\u0026nbsp- a role held from 2014 to 2019 by Jean-Claude Juncker.Under the process, each political grouping in the European Parliament proposes one \u0027lead candidate\u0027 to take the role. The presidency subsequently goes to the political party winning the most seats, or the one that brings together the widest coalition of support for their candidate.However, this is not a formal process set out in any treaty or constitution. The candidate for the role is nominated by the European Council, made up of the leaders of the EU member states. They are able to ignore the Spitzenkandidaten nomination and to chose someone else. The appointment has to be subsequently ratified by the European Parliament though, and therefore choosing an alternative candidate risks provoking conflict between the institutions.Her patchy record as a defence minister has also been raised by the SPD in a dossier circulated among MEPs as a reason why Von der Leyen is “an inadequate and unsuitable candidate” to lead the commission for the next five years.Von der Leyen, a close ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has the backing of the centre-right European People’s party, will make a speech to the European parliament on Tuesday morning before MEPs cast their vote in the early evening but it is far from clear that she will be able to secure the backing of the 374 parliamentarians needed for her to take the post from 1 November.Should she fail to win enough votes the EU would be left in uncharted territory, with the parliament pitted against the leaders on the issue of commission presidency, and with few easy fixes available.Von der Leyen’s selection, after 50 hours of negotiations among the 28 leaders, was just one part of a package in which candidates were also chosen as presidents of the European council and European Central Bank, in which political affiliation, geography and gender had to be balanced. Sources said an emergency summit for 23 July was being planned in case of her rejection.If Von der Leyen passed the 374 threshold but failed to receive the backing of 400 MEPs there would be questions over her ability to lead the EU’s policy agenda given the fragility of her majority.In letters to the Socialists and Democrats and the liberal group, Renew Europe, sent on Monday and obtained by the , Von der Leyen has pledged to give parliament a role in initiating legislation and says she will push forward on stalled progressive policies on climate change, wages and gender equality.She has committed to setting “quotas on gender balance on company boards”, a policy first proposed by the commission in 2012, and to establishing a “legal instrument to ensure that every worker in our union has a fair minimum wage that allows them a decent living in the country they work in”.She has backed the proposal from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for a “carbon border tax” which would hit companies that want to trade in the EU but are based in countries that do not live up to the bloc’s environmental standards.Von der Leyen, 60, who has previously spoken of her support for the idea of a “United States of Europe”, has also called for greater burden sharing when it comes to immigration, in a thinly veiled criticism of the failure of some central and eastern European states to take in asylum seekers.On Brexit she insists that the current withdrawal agreement – described as “defunct” by the likely next UK prime minister, Boris Johnson – is the “best and only deal possible for an orderly withdrawal”. On an extension of the UK’s membership beyond 31 October, she says she would be in support “if good reasons are provided”.Von der Leyen says in her letters that she hopes the “snapshot” on her positions, some of which are retreads of previous proposals from the commission, will reassure her critics, although there is a risk of putting off MEPs within the more Eurosceptic and rightwing European Conservatives and Reformists group, in which Poland’s Law and Justice is the largest party.Portugal’s socialist prime minister António Costa tweeted that Von der Leyen’s letter contained sufficient reassurance for left-wing MEPs to give her their support, describing them as “positive commitments”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb680950c52934fb5244392f428df40121de5773/0_74_5192_3116/master/5192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b99a21080ec951dcc3849a443f15c15d","title":"world hunger un report","story":"Eliminating hunger by 2030 is an immense challenge, say heads of UN agenciesMore than 820 million people are still going hungry in the world, according to a UN report that says reaching the target of zero hunger by 2030 is “an immense challenge”.The number of people with not enough to eat has risen for the third year in a row as the population increases, after a decade when real progress was made. The underlying trend is stabilisation, when global agencies had hoped to see it fall.Millions of children are not getting the nutrition they need. The UN says the pace of progress in halving child stunting and reducing the number of low birthweight babies is too slow, which jeopardises the chances of achieving another of the sustainable development goals.The report is from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the UN Children’s Fund (Unicef), the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization.While hunger remains widespread, obesity – also related to malnutrition – continues to rise in all regions. There are 338 million school-age children and adolescents who are overweight and 672 million obese adults. Asia and Africa, which have nine out of 10 of all stunted children and more than nine out of 10 of all wasted children worldwide are also home to nearly three-quarters of all overweight children worldwide, largely driven by consumption of unhealthy diets.One in seven babies around the world was born with low birthweight in 2015, the report says, many of them to adolescent mothers. That puts them at risk for poor development.The world’s population has steadily grown, with most people living in urban areas. Technology has “evolved at a dizzying pace, while the economy has become increasingly interconnected and globalised,” say the heads of the UN agencies in a foreword to the report.“Many countries, however, have not witnessed sustained growth as part of this new economy. The world economy as a whole is not growing as much as expected.”Climate breakdown is affecting agriculture and the number of farmers has declined. “All of this has led to major shifts in the way in which food is produced, distributed and consumed worldwide – and to new food security, nutrition and health challenges.”Hunger is increasing in countries where economic growth is lagging and there is income inequality.“Our actions to tackle these troubling trends will have to be bolder,” the UN leaders say. “We must foster pro-poor and inclusive structural transformation focusing on people and placing communities at the centre to reduce economic vulnerabilities and set ourselves on track to ending hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Judge said her use of an intellectually disabled woman\u0026rsquos ATM card to make withdrawals was disgracefulMinister for Health regrets the HSE did not tell him of delays in issuing results soonerFootball Association Premier League granted Ireland\u0026rsquos first ever order compelling ISPsEchoes of their father\u0026rsquos sharp wit as eulogies delivered by each of Grace\u0026rsquos four childrenSupreme Court orders State to disclose rang of documents to Gavin TobinThree men convicted at Special Criminal Court over plot to murder Patsy HutchQ+A: Is there any special treatment at all for Irish people?

Photograph: iStockWhat is the current situation with moving to America?The holy grail for those hoping to move to the US long-term is the green card and permanent residence status, but in addition to this, there are about 35 other types of employment visas and work permits available.The range of US employment visas cover most types of employment situations, from trainee internships to professional entrepreneur and expert positions. Unlike the green card, which confers permanent residence status, employment visas are time limited and usually employer and job specific.So what are my main options?Aside from the J-1 visa programme for students and recent graduates, Irish citizens only have three main options: to marry an American citizen get an employer to sponsor them for a H1B visa (which lasts for six years) or the annual Diversity Visa Lottery for a green card - but only about 160 Irish get a green card this way every year. There are also other sector-specific visas such as the I or O visas which apply to workers in certain industries.What happens if I marry an American citizen?If an Irish citizen marries an American citizen, they are automatically eligible to file a request for a green card.Are there any barriers to getting a green card in this situation?James O’Malley, a New York based immigration lawyer originally from Limerick, says there are about “30 different contingencies” examined, including criminal convictions.“If you have more than one criminal conviction, even though they might not be that serious, it can affect you . . .There’s a whole list of things that can affect you but the main one is convictions,” he says.What if I have married an American citizen and have been living in the US. Can I apply for citizenship?Citizenship is a bit more straight forward, according to Mr O’Malley. “Usually after the number of required years on the green card, the citizenship (application process) only really looks at if there are convictions during the green card phase ,” he says. “A serious conviction during the time awaiting the citizenship, usually five years, that can render a person not only ineligible for citizenship, it can lead to them being deported.”How do people become US citizens at birth?To become a citizen at birth, you must have been born in the United States or certain territories or outlying possessions of the US, and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or had a parent or parents who were citizens at the time of your birth (if you were born abroad) and meet other requirements. To become a US citizen after birth you must apply for “derived” or “acquired” citizenship through parents or apply for naturalisation.What about visiting the US in the short-term?Irish citizens can apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorisation) visa waiver to travel to the United States. The ESTA allows Irish citizens to visit the US for tourism, business, transit, medical and short study purposes without a visa for up to 90 days per visit. Irish citizens must apply online for ESTA. An ESTA is required prior to boarding the air or sea vessel to the United States, and should be applied for at least 72 hours before departure.What happens if I overstay my ESTA visa?Mr O’Malley said that overstaying under the ESTA visa “automatically renders a person deportable” “The bottom line is if a person overstays the ESTA they are in danger of being immediately deported and deportable . . . A person who uses ESTA, they waive any right to mounting a defence to deportability,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3957001.1563210175!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"harris not informed of cervical screening issues until july 10th","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPatients’ representatives Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap. PhotographCrispin Rodwell: The The Minister for Health Simon Harris has said it is regrettable that the HSE did not inform him, his department or patient representatives at an earlier stage about delays in issuing cervical screening results to about 800 women. Last week it emerged that the women did not receive their repeat screening results from the US laboratory, Quest Diagnostics in Chantilly, Virginia because of a computer glitch. “I think it’s really important that the HSE does carry out an external independent review in relation to its own processes. Clearly there was a communications issue here, where they believed laboratories had conveyed results to GPs and women and that had not happened.”“That’s not acceptable, I know it’s not acceptable to the chief executive of the HSE and it’s not acceptable to me either,” Mr Harris said.HSE chief Paul Reid said on Monday that he had asked Dublin City University president Prof Brian MacCraith to be the independent chairman of a “rapid review”process to be carried out into the controversy. The delay in issuing the results were first reported in the media on July 11th though the HSE had known about it since last February following a complaint by a woman about a delayed test. The HSE informed the Department of Health on June 25th that there was an IT issue. The HSE was asked to investigate the extent of the problem and reported back to the department again on July 10th. ChronologyMr Reid said the review would set out to determine the exact chronology of events from the time the IT issues first emerged until they went public. The review will set out to establish if correct procedures were followed when the HSE first became aware of the delays. Mr Reid said the delays in informing the women involved were “not acceptable” at a time when the HSE was trying to rebuild confidence in the cervical screening programme in Ireland. “I want this work to commence quickly and be completed in a timely manner, and will ensure Brian and the team are aided in their work by the full co-operation of all involved in the HSE and in the National Screening Service.”Mr Harris said he was only informed about the delay on July 10th, the same day that his department was also informed about the extent of it. The issue came to light when a woman asked the Department of Health about a delay in receiving her test results. The query was passed on to the HSE for investigation to see how widespread the problem was and the response came back to the department on July 10th. “My understanding is that letters with results went in the post to GPs last Thursday, so my expectation is at this stage is that many GPs will have received those results for women, I also understand that the HSE intends to write directly to them and so I would hope that by the middle of this week most women will have received their results, if not all women. “Certainly the aim is that all women will have received their results by the middle of this week.”‘Joke’Labour Party health spokesman Alan Kelly said the terms of reference of the new review were “a joke”. He specifically criticised that the role of the Minister’s’s office was not included.A victim of the cervical cancer controversy on Monday accused the HSE and the Department of Health of not giving her full information as a patient advocate. Lorraine Walsh, whose misdiagnosed smears deprived her of the opportunity of having a child, said she is contemplating resigning from the Government committee set up to try and restore confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.Ms Walsh is one of two patient representatives on the CervicalCheck steering committee which is pushing for reform of the service. The other representative is Stephen Teap, whose wife Irene died in July 2017 having been twice given the all-clear following misdiagnosed smear tests. Ms Walsh said she only found out “45 minutes before the Six One news” last Thursday about the delay. Ms Walsh told The Irish Examiner on Monday she believed the committee was now a waste of time as “the HSE and Department of Health officials are being selective in what they tell us”.She believes pre-meetings take place between officials from both departments and “then we get the spin”.She added: “I thought we were building up a relationship and trust, but I now realise they are withholding information and being selective in what they tell us. I feel like a fool. I’m considering my position at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956308.1563131963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irishman held in us prepares to spend weeks behind bars says father","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKeith Byrne with his wife Keran.

He said he made a stupid mistake 15 years ago and he is paying for it now.”Keith (37) from Fermoy, Co Cork, was arrested by US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officers in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, while travelling to work - a painting and decorating business he has built up over the last five years - on Wednesday.The father-of-three’s family say he has been living and working legally in the US since 2007 but lost a recent appeal against a refusal to grant him residency because of two separate charges of personal use of cannabis on his record from when he was younger in Ireland.“It was only a stupid error he made - he got fined, for God’s sake,” his father Jim told The .“And, now, he is paying the ultimate price.”Officials asked Mr Byrne in prison to sign a form in recent days which would have him deported to Ireland within 48 hours, but he refused and will have to remain locked up until he is seen by a judge, his father said.He expects this could prolong the process by two or three weeks.“Keith has a hell of a lot to fight for - he has an awful lot to lose,” he added.Mr Byrne has phoned his father every weekend since going to the US in 2007 - “I’ve often cursed him on a Sunday for phoning me when the match is on.” - and was always “happy and jolly” about the life he had built for himself and his family, his father said.Being forced to return to Ireland would “devastate” his family and “destroy” his business.“He was getting on great. He gave his first party in his new house for the 4th of July this year - he was living the American dream really,” he said.“He had spent a lot of time on the house, he was sending me pictures of all the work he was doing to it. He didn’t expect this. He had high hopes he would get a Green Card. A friend of his who was there 15 or 16 years eventually got a Green Card and that really boosted Keith.”Mr Byrne’s father said he was worried about his son having to return to Ireland.Mr Byrne’s mother Mary was in a car accident late last year and is still getting hospital treatment for her injuries.“This is the last thing she needed. She is not taking this well,” he said.Mr Byrne’s family in Fermoy are to meet with local TD Sean Sherlock on Monday.Mr Sherlock has called on Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney as well as the Government to “urgently” intervene to seek Mr Byrne’s release and return to his family.“His case highlights the precariousness of Irish people who have settled in the US, who have no legal status but who are contributing to society,” said Mr Sherlock.“It is vital that his case is raised at the highest political level to seek to have him released on humanitarian grounds.“He poses no threat to anyone. His wife and children are beside themselves with worry. A political intervention by the Minister for Foreign Affairs would certainly assist matters at this stage. “Mr Byrne’s family contend that he was never an undocumented immigrant, and when his visa expired he alerted authorities with a view to regularising his situation."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956418.1563122902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd alexandria ocasio cortez going after wrong target","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: engaged in  a tangle  with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that poses a threat to the Democrats’ ability to beat President Donald Trump next year. Photograph: Anna MoneymakerNew York TimesI was feeling on edge. Writing a column that sparks an internecine fight among the highest-profile women in the Democratic Party is nerve-wracking.So I went to the gym. Alex Toussaint, the digital Peloton instructor inside the little screen on my spinning bike, had some wisdom for me – the kind of New Age bromide dispensed in spin classes everywhere:You climb the mountain to see the world. You don’t climb the mountain so the world can see you.I only wished AOC was cycling alongside me to hear it as well.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ensorcelled me from the start. I loved the bartender-makes-good Cinderella story, the shake-up-the-capital idealistic dreams, the bravado about how the plutocrat president from Queens wouldn’t know how to deal with a Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx.And I imagined the most potent feminist partnership in American history: Nancy Pelosi as sensei, bringing her inside game, and AOC, the Karate Kid with a wicked Twitter game.But instead, the 79-year-old speaker and the 29-year-old freshman are trapped in a generational and ideological tangle that poses a real threat to the Democrats’ ability to beat Donald Trump next year.Pelosi told me, after the AOC squad voted against the house’s version of the border Bill and trashed the moderates – the very people who provided the Democrats the majority – that the squad was four people with four votes. She was talking about a legislative reality. If it was a knock, it was for abandoning the party.That did not merit AOC’s outrageous accusation that Pelosi was targeting “newly elected women of colour”. She slimed the speaker, who has spent her life fighting for the downtrodden and who was instrumental in getting the first African-American president elected and passing his agenda against all odds, as a sexist and a racist.AOC should consider the possibility that people who disagree with her do not disagree with her colour.The young lawmaker went further, implying that the speaker was putting the squad in danger, asking why Pelosi would criticise them, “knowing the amount of death threats” and attention they get. Huh?‘Defensive posture’AOC pulled back and said she wasn’t calling Pelosi a racist. But once you start that ball rolling, it’s hard to stop. (You know how topsy-turvy the fight is when the biggest defenders of Pelosi, who has endured being a caricature of extreme liberalism for decades, are Trump and the Wall Street Journal editorial board.)The AOC crew threw down the gauntlet in a recent opinion piece in the Washington Post by the Intercept’s Ryan Grim. He wrote that when Pelosi and other Democratic mandarins try to keep the image of the party centrist, they are crouching in “the defensive posture” they’ve been in since the Reagan revolution.Corbin Trent, a spokesman for AOC and co-founder of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped propel her, told Grim: “The greatest threat to mankind is the cowardice of the Democratic Party”, with the older generation “driven by fear” and “unable to lead”.Message: Pelosi is past her prime.And then there’s the real instigator, Saikat Chakrabarti, AOC’s 33-year-old chief of staff, who co-founded Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, both of which recruited progressives – including AOC – to run against moderates in Democratic primaries. The former Silicon Valley Bernie Bro assumed he could apply Facebook’s mantra, “Move fast and break things,” to one of the oldest institutions in the country.Wrong vs badBut Congress is not a place where you achieve radical progress – certainly not in ided government. It’s a place where you work at it and work at it and don’t get everything you want.The progressives act as though anyone who dares disagree with them is bad. Not wrong, but bad, guilty of some human failing, some impurity that is a moral evil that justifies their venom.Chakrabarti sent shock waves through the Democratic caucus when he posted a tweet about the border Bill comparing moderate and Blue Dog Democrats – some of whom are black – to southern segregationists in the 1940s.Rahm Emanuel told me Chakrabarti is “a snot-nosed punk” who has no idea about the battle scars Pelosi bears from the liberal fights she has led.“What votes did you get?” Emanuel said, rhetorically challenging AOC’s chief of staff. “You should only be so lucky to learn from somebody like Nancy who has shown incredible courage and who has twice returned the Democratic Party to power.“We fought for years to create the majorities to get a Democratic president elected and re-elected, and they’re going to dither it away. They have not decided what’s more important: Do they want to beat Trump or do they want to clear the moderate and centrists out of the party? You really think weakening the speaker is the right strategy to try to get rid of Donald Trump and everything he stands for?”In the age of Trump, there is no more stupid proposition than that Nancy Pelosi is the problem. If AOC and her Pygmalions and acolytes decide that burning down the house is more important than deposing Trump, they will be left with a racist backward president and the emotional satisfaction of their own purity."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956960.1563174679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us immigration raids begin on smaller scale than planned","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA protester holds a sign reading ‘Abolish ICE’ in front of the politan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, California. Photograph: Etienne LaurentEPAA small number of coordinated federal raids targeting undocumented migrant parents and their children took place in the US over the weekend.It marks the beginning of the Trump administration’s plan to swiftly enforce deportation orders against some 2,000 recently arrived migrants who are not eligible to remain in the country.Only a handful of arrests appeared to take place, and they were reported in just a few cities. That was much different from the nationwide show of force that had originally been planned, in which immigration agents were expected to fan out in unison Sunday morning across immigrant communities in major cities. Authorities said more arrests would follow through the week.The plans for the operation were changed at the last minute because of news reports that had tipped off immigrant communities about what to expect, according to officials. Instead of a large simultaneous sweep, the authorities created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week. Inidual Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin, one official said.Though millions of people live in the United States without documentation and are periodically targeted for deportation, the latest raids are aimed primarily at families from Central America who have been arriving in large numbers since fall. With Mr Trump repeatedly thwarted in his attempts to slow the ongoing surge, the raids aim to deport parents and children who are not eligible to stay in the country - some within months after their arrival - as a way to deter others from coming.Immigration authorities planned to continue making arrests throughout the week in at least 10 cities. They had identified at least 2,000 targets for the raids, but may ultimately arrest fewer. Typically, only 20 to 30 per cent of the targets of ICE enforcement are apprehended. And because agents cannot legally force their way in to the homes of their targets, they rely on the element of surprise to be successful - suggesting that the current, highly publicised raids could result in even fewer arrests than usual.The operation was originally scheduled for late June, but it was postponed after harsh opposition from Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocates. Mr Trump confirmed Friday that it would go ahead over the weekend. “They’re going to take people out, and they’re going to bring them back to their countries,” the president said. “Or they’re going to take criminals out, put them in prison, or put them in prison in the countries they came from.” Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, told “Fox \u0026amp Friends” on Sunday that the operation was intended to enforce the rule of law. “Those iniduals who remain here illegally, especially those who’ve received due process more than any other nation in the world would provide someone that came here illegally, to include those with final orders, that there are consequences to those that remain here illegally,” he said.Read more about the Donald Trump

closes luxury 1m mansion used host wild hen stag parties","story":"The £1m property in Talbot Woods, Dorset, which was being let out for rowdy stag and hen partiesLuxury property and architectureLaw and orderA luxury mansion used to host wild hen and stag parties has been shut down after neighbours complained about inflatable penises strewn across lawns and butlers in the buff.The £1million property in Talbot Woods, Dorset, was being let out by millionaire businessman Max Walker to revelers who shouted and swore at all hours and behaved as if they were on the main strip in Ibiza.Neighbours complained of being kept awake by drunken antics at the five-bedroom detached house, including music blaring from loudspeakers, nude butlers at hen parties and phallic-shaped objects being thrown around outside.One resident said: I think the groups who rented the property out were under the impression they were on the main strip in Ibiza, not a quiet residential neighbourhood in Bournemouth.Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said it had received dozens of complaints and took the case to court.It was ruled that the property would be subject to a closure order lasting three months - the maximum period allowed by law.The mansion\u0027s owner, Stephen Millar, and Mr Walker, who was letting it out by agreement with Mr Millar, are only allowed to attend the premises to clean up and dismantle the hot tub, a judge ruled at Poole Magistrates\u0027 Court.  The property was being advertised as \u0027The Stag House and The Party House\u0027 on the website Adventure Connections. It is the latest expensive property in the Bournemouth and Poole area to be rented out for parties, with landlords charging up to £3,000 for a weekend.A boarded up window at the luxury property which large groups of revelers had been renting for raucous pre-wedding celebrationsLee Tharme, an anti-social behaviour officer for the council, told the court that there had been groups of up to 20 people partying at the house, and that a noise abatement notice and community protection warning had both been ignored.He said: The gatherings result in a massive amount of noise and we have had 29 out of hours service calls after 6pm. They have a total disregard for people.Prosecutors claimed that Mr Millar once texted Mr Walker, writing: I won\u0027t tolerate this anymore Max. This is your last chance - too many hens and stags.District judge Stephen Nicholls granted the local council their application for a closure order under Section 80 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014.Luxury property and architectureLaw and orderThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In reply, England at one stage were 864 from 23.1 overs and looked in real trouble. Enter Ben Stokes. His partnership with Jos Buttler was vital and they took the score to 1965 from 44.5 overs when the wicket-keeper departed for a fluent 59. The final five overs saw England lose four wickets, but tie the scores at 241 each, sending the game into unprecedented extra-time.The equation a simple one - six balls, most runs wins the World Cup. If the scores are tied again, England win the World Cup due to more boundaries being hit in their innings. Stokes and Buttler entered the fray once more, accumulating 15 runs. Jimmy Neesham and Martin Guptill were given the responsibility of hitting 16 runs for glory. England\u0027s Jofra Archer - a raw novice of the international game - was tossed the ball and it came down to the final ball with New Zealand needing two runs for glory. The ball was whipped out to Jason Roy on the boundary. He fielded, launched the ball in to Buttler who ed to demolish the stumps, running a ing Guptill out as he attempted to return for the winning second run. One of the greatest cricket matches ever seen was shown live on terrestrial TV after Sky agreed to share rights with Channel 4.The last time Channel 4 aired the England and Wales cricket team live was in 2005 - when England beat Australia to win The Ashes. Dubbed the greatest series ever played, it inspired a generations - including many of those who took to the field at Lord\u0027s on Sunday. It is hoped this World Cup triumph will do the same. And, as man-of-the-match Ben Stokes surmised in his post-match comments, the children who watched the incredible events of Sunday and attending The Oval today could be in his position having been inspired to take up the game.What could be more thrilling than a day bunking off school? Permission from mum, and a trip to the Oval to watch your cricketing heroes lift the World Cup, writes Eleanor Steafel from The Oval. The stands are filling up with children, all waiting patiently to watch England parade onto the pitch. Seven-year-old Ben Chandler said Sunday’s super over was so exciting. I got quite bored so I just played a game, but then Dad was yelling so I started watching again for the super over. He pronounced today’s celebrations: The best day ever! A whole day off school! England win the Cricket World Cup, in picturesJack Nagioff, also 7, is hoping to get close enough to his hero Joe Root that he might sign his bat. I was about to burst at one point yesterday, he said. Sam Byford Scott brought his son Finn along for the day. We emailed the school this morning and just said look, it’s a once in a lifetime chance. It means a lot to be here today with him. He was, he says, a little over excited yesterday. There was an element of faith testing. The victorious England team are expected to attend a Downing Street reception at 7pm.Theresa May said: Yesterday was a brilliant performance by a brilliant team. They showed flair, courage and an absolute determination to become world champions.The achievement, delivered in such a thrilling style on home soil, will live forever in our sporting history.It\u0027s also exciting to think just how many children will be inspired by this victory to pick up a bat for the first time and hopefully become the great cricketers and World Cup winners of tomorrow.We must build on this success, and only yesterday we published the school sport and activity plan. This has been welcomed by nearly 40 leading sports organisations as well as Sport England who said it was a great step forward.Downing Street would not be drawn on any honours the England team might receive, saying the issue would be dealt with in the usual way.We\u0027re having the reception this evening, the PM does think it\u0027s a truly great achievement, but those sorts of considerations are all for another day, the Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said.Asked whether the Prime Minister believed cricket should be broadcast on free-to-air TV, the spokesman said: We welcome Sky\u0027s decision to put the final on Channel 4 yesterday.I would also point out that England international and English domestic cricket will be shown live on the BBC from next year, with over 100 hours to be shown each summer over the course of a five-year deal.But negotiations on TV rights are a matter for sports authorities and broadcasters and the Government was clear there must be a balance between retaining free-to-air coverage while allowing rights holders to negotiate agreements.Morgan: \u0027We had Allah on our side\u0027England\u0027s Eoin Morgan hailed the ersity of his World Cup-winning team after the hosts beat New Zealand in the final at Lord\u0027s.Morgan, who was born in Dublin and switched allegiance from Ireland to England a decade ago, was asked: Do you think the luck of an Irishman got England over the line?His response has since gone viral on social media.We had Allah with us as well, said Morgan.

I have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people he said. While he did not name the intelligence agencies, a senior ANC official close to Mr Zuma told The Daily  that he meant American and British spies working in collaboration with apartheid-era South African intelligence operatives. Carl Neihaus, a former political prisoner and Zuma loyalist, claimed UK and US agencies had plotted against Mr Zuma to “oppose, change, or delay radical economic transformation in South Africa.”Mr Zuma’s presidency ended in scandal in 2018 amid allegations that his family had conspired to use the machinery of state to advance the interests of Ajay, Atul, and Rajesh “Tony” Gupta, three Indian-born brothers who controlled one of South Africa’s largest business empires. Public officials and investigative journalists have alleged that the corruption amounted to effective capture of the state by private interests, with the Guptas exercising de-facto control of ministries, public utilities, the state broadcaster and even the national airline in a scheme that cost the country tens of billions of dollars. Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing, claiming that the allegations are politically motivated. In his testimony on Monday, Mr Zuma claimed his predecessors, including Nelson Mandela, were also friendly with the Guptas, and suggested he was being singled out for persecution. What is wrong with the relationship? Nothing is wrong. Many other people are friends with these comrades. They are not the issue - the issue is Zuma, he said. Facing questions from Paul Pretorius, the senior advocate, Mr Zuma said he did not remember 27 director generals of government ministries writing to him in 2016 requesting an investigations into the Guptas\u0027 influence. He said he could not recall instructing Themba Maseko, a former head of the government communications service, to help the Guptas. Mr Maseko earlier told the commission that the Guptas in turn told him to direct the government\u0027s R600m (£35 million) advertising budget to a newspaper and television channel they owned.Mr Zuma was forced to resign by his ruling African National Congress party over widespread reports of corruptionThe scandal has profoundly damaged the reputation of the ruling ANC. Mr Zuma was resigned as president in February 2018 rather than face a vote of no confidence in parliament.  He set up the commission under pressure from rivals in the ANC in his last weeks in office.Cyril Rhamaphosa, his successor as president and party leader, has promised to clean up corruption in the party and the country during presidential elections in May. The case has also drawn in major mutlinational companies, with ethical shortcomings found at the accountancy firm KPMG and the management consultants McKinsey and Bain and Co.In 2017 The British PR firm Bell Pottinger collapsed into administration after it emerged it had been hired by the Guptas to run a publicity campaign to inflame racial tensions. Mr Zuma, an ethnic Zulu, remains popular in his home region of Kwazulu Natal, and supporters demonstrated outside the commission building in central Johannesburg on Monday. There was a heavy police presence but no violence. Mr Zuma is expected to continue his testimony over then next four days. Trump administration announces plans to stop asylum claims at US-Mexico borderSocial media linked to rise in teenage depression as shows off \u0026#39perfect lives\u0026#39

meters go welsh latest glitch changes language devices","story":"Many smart meter owners have reported their meters randomly changing to WelshSmart meter displays have randomly switched to Welsh baffling English homeowners in the latest glitch to plague users of the devices.Several customers of Bulb contacted the advice site Moneysavingexpert to say that their in-home display had switched from saying “today’s usage” to “Defnydd heddiw”. In order to fix the problem the non-Welsh speakers were told they had to navigate a five-step menu in Welsh.But when the Daily  showed the menu options to a native Welsh speaker he described them as “gibberish”. For example, at one stage users are given the option “Clirio Gosodiadau Wedi anfon yr” which the Welsh speaker said directly translates as “clear the installations has been sent”.Bulb, which has 1.3 million customers, said the problem only affected one in 200 of its smart meters and was the result of a software issue with the in-home displays.Smart meters | Help the  investigateBulb customer James Tombs who lives in Sussex, more than 100 miles from the Welsh border, told Moneysavingexpert: I don\u0027t live in Wales and don\u0027t know Welsh. One day I saw my meter was in Welsh but ignored it as I was busy. I then came back to it later and realised that the screen was locked, the buttons didn\u0027t do anything and the unit wasn\u0027t updating. The clock was stuck at 15.47.I turned it off with the power button on the back and back on and it loaded up again, in Welsh, but it was operational.”He added: “I went on to the Bulb forums, found others with the same problem and followed the directions to change language. It has been fine since.But not all afflicted customers were so lucky. One told Moneysavingexpert he had made a formal complaint to Bulb after its proposed fix only temporarily rectified the problem.Bulb would not reveal how many smart meters it has but said that the wider roll-out of the devices is a big technical challenge.A spokesman said: In some rare cases, in-home displays switch to Welsh. While we think Welsh is a great language, we understand that in many cases people will want their display to be in English.“Luckily the solution is just a few button presses away, and language settings can be changed in less than 10 seconds.Everything you need to know about smart energy metersThe £11bn smart meter roll-out aims to reduce energy usage by providing every household with a display which shows energy usage in real-time in pounds and pence, while the meter itself sends readings to suppliers automatically.Many of the early devices “go dumb” and lose their smart functions if a customer switches supplier which has created frustration for millions.A fix for this problem which will see the first-generation devices connected to a national network is currently in progress but is understood to have been delayed for many households.Trump administration announces plans to stop asylum claims at US-Mexico borderSocial media linked to rise in teenage depression as shows off \u0026#39perfect lives\u0026#39 of wealthier peers, study suggests Theresa May thinks Donald Trump\u0026#39s comments about congresswomen are \u0026#39completely unacceptable\u0026#39Tory leadership latest: Jeremy Hunt warns voters not to assume Boris Johnson will be next leader Comment: The penny has finally dropped for the political elite that Remain has lostFormer South African leader Jacob Zuma cries conspiracy during inquiry into state captureComment: If we can put a man on the moon, we can get to net zero Comment: Gina Miller is back – and her claims to be standing up for democracy are fooling no one£1m mansion rented out to hen and stag parties shut after residents say it made area \u0026#39like main strip in Ibiza\u0026#39Comment: Smug North Londoners who smoke weed with their kids are the most dangerous kind of snobComment: No, of course you shouldn\u0026#39t need a degree to show someone round a houseEngland celebrate winning the 2019 Cricket World Cup final at The OvalSolicitor in four year wheelie bin row with doctor is cleared of harassmentThe greatest British play of the century: why Jez Butterworth\u0026#39s Jerusalem is a masterpieceSainsbury\u0026#39s accused of \u0026#39devaluing house prices\u0026#39 in Kent village Dealer who sold chemsex drugs to serial killer Stephen Port convicted of Bond actor\u0026#39s murderFour children arrested after stealing parents\u0026#39 SUV and driving across Australian outbackBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit plan – and what Europe might make of itWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/15/17/turing.jpg","title":"alan turing new 50 note code binary birthday","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsHidden message is placed in tribute to pioneering codebreakerClick to followThe Independent TechIt is a fitting tribute for the world\u0027s most pre-eminent codebreaker: a mysterious set of 1s and 0s emblazened across the new £50 note.As the Bank of England announced that Alan Turing would be the face of the new note, the design was largely as expected.

Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As soon as they dropped down onto the surface, they had to carry out one of their most important missions: scooping up bits of the Moon and bringing it back down to Earth.The difficulty of doing so was one of the things that occupied the scientists and the astronauts that carried out the mission.But the fact they were able to was a discovery that helped inform discoveries about the origin of the solar system and perhaps one day of life. Those rocks help inform research even to this day.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin arrived on the Moon, picking\u0026nbspup the rocks in the first place proved very difficult. The astronauts were wearing huge pressure suits, which made it very difficult to move around at all and even harder to bend down.To solve those problems, they were given special tools, not unlike the tongs used to pick up litter back on Earth, as well as rakes . That meant they could scoop up and pick up the rocks without having to contend with the difficulty of getting near the floor.Created with Sketch.Apollo 11\u0027s historic first moon landing - In pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Edwin \u0027Buzz\u0027 Aldrin walking on the moon in an iconic image taken by \u0027Apollo 11\u0027 commander and first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, on 20 July 1969. 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, an event seen as the peak of the United States\u0027 space program of the 1960s which put an end to the so-called \u0027Race to Space\u0027 between the Cold War rivals the US and the Soviet Union.

The photographs were taken next to another tool that was carried up to the moon, which was placed next to the rock and so allowed anyone looking at it to understand what size and colour it was.As well as the photographs, astronauts had to go through a detailed checklist that was attached to their arms. It reminded them to take full details of the samples, ensuring the scientists on Earth had as much information as they could when the rocks were returned.The places on Earth that look like the moonThe astronauts then took the samples and loaded them into boxes in the lunar module, ready for its ascent stage to take them all back to the Apollo command module and head back down to Earth.After they came back, scientists got to work examining the rocks. Among other things, they found that the new samples might be the oldest ever held by humanity: some of them are nearly 4.5 billion years old, much older than the rocks on Earth.Some of the samples are still sealed up, lying untouched and exactly as they were the day they were taken from the Moon.But they also proved a useful diplomatic tool, too. The US sent out samples of the rock to dozens of different countries, creating 250 lunar sample displays that could be sent around the world to various countries.Each of them had a tiny amount of Moon dust – some 0.05 grams – which came as four little pieces. The presentation boxes also included the flag of the nation that had been sent to them, and included a flag that had been carried to the Moon on board the lander.They each bore an inscription that made clear that they had been given to the people of the country by Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America.This Flag of Your Nation was Carried to the Moon and Back by Apollo 11 and This Fragment of the Moon\u0027s Surface was Brought to Earth by the Crew of That First Manned Lunar Landing, it said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was listening to music on his phone using Spotify, and watching films on Netflix, but he was struggling to buy textbooks or find them in the library when he needed one. Surely, he thought, it must be possible to access books in the same way I access music, film or data? Easily and cheaply, anywhere, any time. But, he realised, there was no subscription service for books. Thus was born Perlego (Latin for “I read through” or “I scan”), the Spotify of textbooks. Van Malderen even went on to write his thesis on the subject, “Why the Old Textbook Model is Broken”.There is a scandal, verging on a scam, in the realm of textbooks. Since 1982, the price of textbooks has risen at three times the rate of inflation. Some figures depict a tenfold increase. As if students didn’t have enough trouble already with tuition fees. They would be justified in feeling it’s a rip-off, up there with secondary ticketing for gigs and flights to Madrid when there’s a Champions League Cup Final on. Perlego aims to make learning accessible, without perhaps killing off libraries completely. “Students can still go to the library to study,” says its CEO and co-founder Van Malderen.Gauthier Van Malderen, 26, was born in Belgium, lived in Henley-on-Thames as a kid, and was an undergraduate in economics and management at Bocconi University in Milan. His dad is in banking and his parents expected him to go into finance. “They nearly had a heart attack when I mentioned textbooks online.” They’ve swung around since. Van Malderen the younger is really responding to student need. When he was still an undergraduate he noticed that most students were using notepads so he set up a business producing very classy notepads, called\u0026nbspIconic Matter (“made by students for students”) with advertising from big companies at the bottom of the page, selling them in Belgium, Switzerland and Morocco. He made enough money out of that scheme to launch Perlego, together with backing from the founder of Zoopla, Alex Chesterman.There are a couple of open access websites where you can download books for free, such as OpenStax, funded by Bill Gates – but it’s non-profit, and Van Malderen is on the side of writers as much as readers.\u0026nbsp“If you’re going to produce high quality work, then it would be nice to get paid.” Van Malderen is sympathetic towards professors. “They don’t want students to have to pay through the nose. They don’t ‘adopt’\u0026nbsptextbooks anymore” (ie\u0026nbspmaking them required reading). In the context of universities trying to open up access, the question of affordability becomes more crucial than ever.We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutionsThe other possible avenue for impecunious students is, of course, theft, not so much nicking books from the library, more using piracy websites. Sitting at a laptop in his offices in Holborn, Gauthier showed me how he could illicitly download the pdf of a classic textbook, Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice, entirely for free. “No wonder publishers are having a hard time,” says van Malderen. “There is a vicious spiral effect. They lose 28 per cent\u0026nbspto piracy, 30 per cent\u0026nbspto second-hand sales.” In short, at present, publishers, authors, and students all end up feeling ripped off.Apparently 88 per cent\u0026nbspof students don’t see piracy as a crime. Van Malderen thinks legal can be cooler. “We can show them the convenience of having one space – a one-stop shop – where you can get all your books. And no one gets ripped off.” The average spend on textbooks in the UK is £439 (medicine will cost a lot more than English) in the US it’s $1,200. The cost of subscribing to Perlego is £12 a month.Perlego also hosts all those public domain books, like The Odyssey and Das Kapital. “The culture has changed,” Van Malderen says. “It’s like music – you don’t want to own the book anymore.” Perlego is a streaming service. You don’t download, you read the book page by page online, on your phone if you like. It’s a “mobile-first learning experience”, as Van Malderen describes it. You can create your own library, like a playlist. And unlike the books in the university library, you can legitimately scribble in the margins and underline sentences, personalising the text.You can become part of a network of readers, with input from other students, so you can compare notes, and get comments from professors too. It’s a virtual seminar that feels like it could make the real, traditional learning environment redundant. “We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutions,” says Van Malderen. “We’re just aiming to make learning more efficient.” It’s like reading, plus social media, where you can “follow” other readers if you like. There is potential for “lifelong learning” too. 25 per cent\u0026nbspof Perlego subscribers are not students, but professionals (or would-be professionals) seeking to upgrade.How do you plan Wimbledon? It’s all about attention to detail‘If we get one person to give up cow’s milk, we’ve made a difference’Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulAccording to the aggregate data Perlego has collected, psychology is the biggest growth area in higher education, which is good for psychology professors\u0026nbspand publishers to know. But the main intellectual advantage of the online system is that, whatever subject you’re studying, you can always dabble in something else – you’re not restricted to the books specified in your course. “For example,” says Van Malderen, “I was doing economics, but say I wanted to branch out into political science or philosophy, it’s right here”. It’s a whole online library rather than just a bunch of textbooks.A declaration of interest: I teach at Cambridge. I know from personal experience that one thing that always drives students mad is how to put in references at the end of their essays. I’m not one for making recommendations, but I think the next time a student asks me how to do it (and I know it’s going to go wrong somehow), I might say, “Have you tried Perlego?”. All you have to do is skip to the references section, highlight, copy, then paste. Full marks.

With Brexit bringing an end to reciprocal medical cover, this mattersClick to followThe IndependentThanks to the Conservative Party some 14m people may find travel to Europe much more difficult if not impossible after October 31.\u0026nbspThose people are those of use with pre existing medical conditions.Even with the reciprocal health coverage we currently enjoy thanks to the UK\u0027s memberhip of the EU, it’s still wise for us to take out travel insurance. A no deal Brexit would make it essential. And that can prove very expensive.\u0026nbspHow can we get a fair deal on our travel insurance?How to buy the right travel insuranceThe Financial Conduct Authority waking up to the issue is therefore timely.\u0026nbspIt is proposing a series of reforms to a market in which it currently is legal to discriminate against those with disabilities in a way that it is not against, say, male drivers. The statistics show that those of us with a Y chromosome pose more risk of an accident, which used to be reflected in our premiums. However, the EU put paid to that and you won’t hear many complaints about its decision from the usual suspects.\u0026nbspIf you have a pre-existing medical condition the same protection does not apply. You’re likely to pay more, and potentially so much more that it makes travel impossible, or get hit with exclusions, which can severely limited the effectiveness of travel insurance policies. \u0026nbspThe watchdog is proposing to address this by mandating that insurers point customers to a directory of alternatives who might be prepared to do better when they load their premiums or demand exclusions.\u0026nbspThere are specialists out there which can offer improved deals and policies for we who have pre existing conditions. They still charge more - I pay more than the rest of my family put together - but they can be an improvement on what mainstream insurers offer. \u0026nbspA good innovation? I have to admit to being in two minds about this.\u0026nbspIt may help people get cover who might otherwise be stuck. A couple of years ago Scope, the disability charity, highlighted the case of Samantha Renke, an a 31-year-old actress and disability campaigner, who was quoted £500 for a two-week trip to Mexico.\u0026nbspShe has osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bones, but had had her spine straightened with rods, which would have significantly reduced the risk of her having to claim as a result of her disability. The insurers she tried appeared unwilling to take this into account.\u0026nbspAt a time when underwriting is becoming increasingly automated, with artificial intelligence playing a progressively greater role, I expect this to happen more and more often.\u0026nbspThe FCA’s plan might have helped address the issues she faced. She would have\u0026nbspbeen referred to the\u0026nbspdirectory. I imagine the same thing would happen to me.\u0026nbspBut I worry that what the watchdog is doing is pushing\u0026nbsp14m Britons into an insurance ghetto, allowing what you might call mainstream insurers to wash their hands of us, rather than making them treat us fairly.\u0026nbspSo the plan is not without thorns.

Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAccording to the Which? High Street survey 201929 8. House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesIt said: “The reasons for the delay are the complexities of the integration into the company of the House of Fraser business, and the current uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business, together with the increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors and audits.“These factors have led to a need for the company to compile more information than in previous years for the audit of period ended 28 April 2019, and has therefore impacted on preparations for and responses to increased challenges in connection with this audit.“Sports Direct would also note that increased regulatory scrutiny is leading to longer lead times generally for the completion of audits.“Sports Direct believes its accounts and their audit to be at an advanced stage. However, there are a number of key areas to conclude on which could materially affect the guidance given in Sports Direct’s announcement of 13 December 2018.”Mike Ashley makes bid for Patisserie ValerieInvestors and analysts were shocked at the decision, branding House of Fraser a “disaster area”, and said Sports Direct should avoid creating more uncertainty.Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “There may be something in what Sports Direct say about company audits generally taking longer because of increased regulation (Superdry’s results were delayed by the complexity of its onerous store impairment provision), but the company hasn’t updated the City since its interims in December and House of Fraser is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation.”Mr Ashley has been on a serious spending spree across the high street in recent years, buying up Evans Cycles, sofa and Game Digital.But his biggest purchase – House of Fraser – from administrators last year, has proved tough to turn around at a time when the high street is struggling to bring customers into stores.Earlier this year, House of Fraser already revealed an underlying pre-tax loss for the first six months of the year of £31.5m on revenues of £70.1m.Bosses had previously said it could break even in the new financial year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste.Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin’s eventual exile to Europe. The years between 1940’s The Great Dictator and Chaplin’s most polarising film hadn’t been kind to Chaplin thanks to scandal in his private life and the increasing perception of his supposed communist sympathies. Chaplin’s subsequent feelings of isolation and alienation informed this pitch black tale of a bluebeard who woos and murders a series of wealthy women so that he can support his own family. Chaplin’s satirical social commentary and his character’s defence that his crimes paled into insignificance in comparison with the horrors of the real world found no favour either at the box office or with critics, and the little tramp’s journey from the world’s most loved entertainer to public enemy number one was complete. Forget the wretched Ben Stiller remake and try and view a (very rare) copy of this superb comedy of embarrassment and while you’re about it, go for a double header of the oft overlooked Miss May’s work with 1971’s A New Leaf. A Jewish boy (Charles Grodin) marries a gauche young woman in haste (Jeannie Berlin) and decides to end the marriage when he falls for and woos alluring blond goddess Cybill Shepherd whilst on honeymoon, to the uncomprehending disbelief of Shepherd’s Wasp father, Eddie Albert. There are superb performances all round, with Oscar nominated Berlin (May’s daughter), a stand out. In other hands the whole premise could have dissolved into bathos, but May and screenwriter Neil Simon produced a film that is wise, funny and true, and in the restaurant scene when Grodin dumps his new bride, well... heartbreaking.  410 Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987)A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its’ many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (“Don’t you threaten me with a dead fish!” etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson’s terrific semi-autobiographical script in this hilarious tale of two base, out of work actors living in squalor who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers, (“Look at my tongue, it’s wearing a yellow sock.”) and stands as a perfect farewell to the flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties.510 Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971)A cult favourite dismissed and panned by critics on its’ release, Harold and Maude’s reputation has grown immeasurably over the years. The story revolves around the tender romance between Harold (Bud Cort), a death obsessed 20-year-old and 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), a holocaust survivor whose joie de vivre stems from that experience. Critics and cinema goers couldn’t get past Harold’s elaborately staged fake suicides and the love story between the pair, (If it had been a 79-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, would there have been so much resistance?), but beneath the gallows humour  lies a rather warm and moving film.Mackendrick was soon to depart for America to make the very dark Sweet Smell of Success and The Ladykillers was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong. Mackendrick himself viewed the film as an ironic joke about the condition of a decaying post war England and the breakdown of the old order. A gang of thieves rent a room in a sweet old lady’s house (a scene stealing Katie Johnson), and masquerade as musicians while they plan and execute their latest caper. When the indomitable old lady threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to kill her. The gang, a marvellous gallery of grotesques played by Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, and Danny Green then have to decide who’s going to do the dirty deed but only end up offing each other in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. The movie’s plot supposedly arrived fully formed to screenwriter William Rose in a dream, and The Ladykillers remains one of Ealing’s greatest works.One of their finest achievements, and one of the standout films of the 1990s, Fargo put the Coen brothers in the major league, winning a best screenplay Oscar. Frances McDormand lifted the best actress award for her role as the heavily pregnant Minnesota police chief who hides a razor-sharp mind behind her congenial, homely persona. This quality allows the chief to piece together the convoluted tale of a kidnapping for ransom that goes disastrously wrong. Jarringly violent in places and with an other-worldly ambience, Fargo is shot full of the brothers’ trademark dark humour and lives up to its’ blurb: “a lot can happen in the middle of nowhere”. MASH fully deserves its’ exalted status as the landmark antiwar film of its’ time or indeed of any time. Made at the height of the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War, the parallels between the two conflicts couldn’t have been clearer. The audience was left in no doubt about MASH’s intended targets – the horrors and absurdities of war which in real life were being beamed from Vietnam into a weary nation’s living rooms, bungling military bureaucracy, the head nurse who is immune to the suffering around her, Uncle Sam, God, the whole nine yards. The outrageous practices and cruel capers perpetrated by Trapper, Hawkeye, et al on their victims, the jokes and ad libs in the operating theatre while the surgeons are covered in blood and gore, are a coping mechanism, a way of staying sane in an insane world. In other words, we laugh, lest we cry.910 Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949)Alec Guinness famously played eight roles in this very dark comedy of manners and is of course, brilliant, but he is matched all the way by a marvellously urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who calmly murders his way to a dukedom. The film takes barbed pot-shots at the aristocracy and the class ide and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring the film “a hilarious study in the gentle art of murder”. Price’s exquisite voiceover and the savage twist in the tail are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, the pinnacle of Ealing’s wonderful body of work, and one of the greatest British films ever made.1010 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964)A deranged US general deliberately launches a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union and the hapless American President (“Dimitri, we have a little problem...”) has to deal with the fallout. Possibly only Kubrick would dare make a film about a nuclear attack on the USSR while the Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in many people’s minds, but he created an instant classic in this justly famous and celebrated example of his dark art. Dr Strangelove boasts a wonderful screenplay by Kubrick and Terry Southern that aptly sums up the warped rationale of the so-called nuclear deterrent and has a uniformly brilliant cast, including Peter Sellers playing three roles. It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today.110 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003)The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall’s stores. A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste.Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin’s eventual exile to Europe. The years between 1940’s The Great Dictator and Chaplin’s most polarising film hadn’t been kind to Chaplin thanks to scandal in his private life and the increasing perception of his supposed communist sympathies. Chaplin’s subsequent feelings of isolation and alienation informed this pitch black tale of a bluebeard who woos and murders a series of wealthy women so that he can support his own family. Chaplin’s satirical social commentary and his character’s defence that his crimes paled into insignificance in comparison with the horrors of the real world found no favour either at the box office or with critics, and the little tramp’s journey from the world’s most loved entertainer to public enemy number one was complete. Forget the wretched Ben Stiller remake and try and view a (very rare) copy of this superb comedy of embarrassment and while you’re about it, go for a double header of the oft overlooked Miss May’s work with 1971’s A New Leaf. A Jewish boy (Charles Grodin) marries a gauche young woman in haste (Jeannie Berlin) and decides to end the marriage when he falls for and woos alluring blond goddess Cybill Shepherd whilst on honeymoon, to the uncomprehending disbelief of Shepherd’s Wasp father, Eddie Albert. There are superb performances all round, with Oscar nominated Berlin (May’s daughter), a stand out. In other hands the whole premise could have dissolved into bathos, but May and screenwriter Neil Simon produced a film that is wise, funny and true, and in the restaurant scene when Grodin dumps his new bride, well... heartbreaking.  410 Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987)A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its’ many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (“Don’t you threaten me with a dead fish!” etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson’s terrific semi-autobiographical script in this hilarious tale of two base, out of work actors living in squalor who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers, (“Look at my tongue, it’s wearing a yellow sock.”) and stands as a perfect farewell to the flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties.510 Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971)A cult favourite dismissed and panned by critics on its’ release, Harold and Maude’s reputation has grown immeasurably over the years. The story revolves around the tender romance between Harold (Bud Cort), a death obsessed 20-year-old and 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), a holocaust survivor whose joie de vivre stems from that experience. Critics and cinema goers couldn’t get past Harold’s elaborately staged fake suicides and the love story between the pair, (If it had been a 79-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, would there have been so much resistance?), but beneath the gallows humour  lies a rather warm and moving film.Mackendrick was soon to depart for America to make the very dark Sweet Smell of Success and The Ladykillers was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong. Mackendrick himself viewed the film as an ironic joke about the condition of a decaying post war England and the breakdown of the old order. A gang of thieves rent a room in a sweet old lady’s house (a scene stealing Katie Johnson), and masquerade as musicians while they plan and execute their latest caper. When the indomitable old lady threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to kill her. The gang, a marvellous gallery of grotesques played by Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, and Danny Green then have to decide who’s going to do the dirty deed but only end up offing each other in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. The movie’s plot supposedly arrived fully formed to screenwriter William Rose in a dream, and The Ladykillers remains one of Ealing’s greatest works.One of their finest achievements, and one of the standout films of the 1990s, Fargo put the Coen brothers in the major league, winning a best screenplay Oscar. Frances McDormand lifted the best actress award for her role as the heavily pregnant Minnesota police chief who hides a razor-sharp mind behind her congenial, homely persona. This quality allows the chief to piece together the convoluted tale of a kidnapping for ransom that goes disastrously wrong. Jarringly violent in places and with an other-worldly ambience, Fargo is shot full of the brothers’ trademark dark humour and lives up to its’ blurb: “a lot can happen in the middle of nowhere”. MASH fully deserves its’ exalted status as the landmark antiwar film of its’ time or indeed of any time. Made at the height of the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War, the parallels between the two conflicts couldn’t have been clearer. The audience was left in no doubt about MASH’s intended targets – the horrors and absurdities of war which in real life were being beamed from Vietnam into a weary nation’s living rooms, bungling military bureaucracy, the head nurse who is immune to the suffering around her, Uncle Sam, God, the whole nine yards. The outrageous practices and cruel capers perpetrated by Trapper, Hawkeye, et al on their victims, the jokes and ad libs in the operating theatre while the surgeons are covered in blood and gore, are a coping mechanism, a way of staying sane in an insane world. In other words, we laugh, lest we cry.910 Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949)Alec Guinness famously played eight roles in this very dark comedy of manners and is of course, brilliant, but he is matched all the way by a marvellously urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who calmly murders his way to a dukedom. The film takes barbed pot-shots at the aristocracy and the class ide and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring the film “a hilarious study in the gentle art of murder”. Price’s exquisite voiceover and the savage twist in the tail are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, the pinnacle of Ealing’s wonderful body of work, and one of the greatest British films ever made.1010 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964)A deranged US general deliberately launches a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union and the hapless American President (“Dimitri, we have a little problem...”) has to deal with the fallout.

It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today.Skinner, who is teetotal, also spoke about his past struggle with alcoholism, saying: “It’s become cool to stop drinking these days, but people don’t stop drinking like I did. I did it because I thought I was going to die.“I got anxious that I’d switched from sherry to Pernod as a breakfast drink. The sherry never bothered me — I had five or six years of sherry for breakfast. But Pernod, that was getting out of hand.”Frank Skinner Live will run at Assembly George Square in Edinburgh from 31 July – 18 August and his Showbiz tour starts on 12 September.Have I Got News For You\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender.

Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAccording to the Which? High Street survey 201929 8. House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesIt said: “The reasons for the delay are the complexities of the integration into the company of the House of Fraser business, and the current uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business, together with the increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors and audits.“These factors have led to a need for the company to compile more information than in previous years for the audit of period ended 28 April 2019, and has therefore impacted on preparations for and responses to increased challenges in connection with this audit.“Sports Direct would also note that increased regulatory scrutiny is leading to longer lead times generally for the completion of audits.“Sports Direct believes its accounts and their audit to be at an advanced stage. However, there are a number of key areas to conclude on which could materially affect the guidance given in Sports Direct’s announcement of 13 December 2018.”Mike Ashley makes bid for Patisserie ValerieInvestors and analysts were shocked at the decision, branding House of Fraser a “disaster area”, and said Sports Direct should avoid creating more uncertainty.Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “There may be something in what Sports Direct say about company audits generally taking longer because of increased regulation (Superdry’s results were delayed by the complexity of its onerous store impairment provision), but the company hasn’t updated the City since its interims in December and House of Fraser is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation.”Mr Ashley has been on a serious spending spree across the high street in recent years, buying up Evans Cycles, sofa and Game Digital.But his biggest purchase – House of Fraser – from administrators last year, has proved tough to turn around at a time when the high street is struggling to bring customers into stores.Earlier this year, House of Fraser already revealed an underlying pre-tax loss for the first six months of the year of £31.5m on revenues of £70.1m.Bosses had previously said it could break even in the new financial year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It doesn’t have clear targets it doesn’t have the same ministerial interest it doesn’t have the funding and it’s not prioritised so it doesn’t necessarily have the resources, so I think that’s the department’s challenge.“That’s why outsourcing is part of its modus operandi. That’s one way in which it can try and manage all this capacity – to give the task to somebody else.”Mr Bolt raised concerns about difficulties for visa applicants and for other\u0026nbspimmigrants to access the services of private firms who have commercial contracts with the Home Office, such as Sopra Steria, a French firm that took over\u0026nbspin-country visa processing\u0026nbspin November.The Independent revealed last month that the company had raked in millions for providing what lawyers branded a “substandard” service, which had forced some applicants to pay high fees and travel hundreds of miles to submit\u0026nbspapplications on time.\u0026nbspMPs and lawyers subsequently called for an independent investigation into the outsourced system, raising “extreme concerns” about Sopra Steria’s “capacity and ability” to run the service.Speaking after an event\u0026nbsporganised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Visas and Immigration on Thursday, Mr Bolt said: “When you hear that people have difficulty accessing Sopra Steria or any of the other outsourced commercial contracts, what is the Home Office doing to ensure that what they’re providing is actually\u0026nbspmeeting the terms of the contract?“In earlier contracts, one of the challenges was whether the contract had been properly funded, so there’s been an attempt to try and do things slightly on the cheap. And then it always feels rather reluctant to press the provider, because they realised they’ve got the provider over a barrel.“The question is, does it retain sufficient visibility of what’s going on and sufficient control over it? And to what extent is it accountable for what’s delivered?”A report published by Mr Bolt\u0026nbspin 2016, which aimed to understand how the Home Office was going to assess the effectiveness of the\u0026nbsphostile environment policies, found there were “no real measurements in place to collect, analyse and evaluate” the measures.But the chief inspector questioned whether the department had “the capacity to do anything about it” because they were “short of resource generally, meaning everything is under pressure” – likening the situation to “changing a tyre as you’re driving down the motorway”.“Across all of the Home Office, its business is bigger than its capacity to manage. It’s constantly having to make decisions about priorities, and getting dragged off to do things. That for me is one of the key issues – whether it’s got the bandwidth to cope with everything,” he added.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We welcome the independent scrutiny of the chief inspector and take his comments, criticism and recommendations very seriously.\u0026nbsp“We are committed to delivering an immigration system that is fair and delivers value for money for the taxpayer and the inspector is a crucial part of that work. It is only right that the department and ministers give full consideration to the recommendations made in ICIBI\u0026nbsp(independent chief inspector of borders and immigration)\u0026nbspreports, which can be complex and wide-ranging.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the German politician was emphatic\u0026nbspshe would not change the deal struck by Theresa May, adding: “The withdrawal agreement negotiated with the United Kingdom is the best and only possible deal for an orderly withdrawal.”The letter was sent by Ms von der Leyen to the leaders of the socialist and liberal groups in the European parliament, whose support she needs to be confirmed as president. They had written to her to ask her to spell out her programme to win their votes. “I want to explain my thinking on Brexit,” Ms von der Leyen concludes the letter, which was obtained by The Independent.No-deal Brexit will leave UK at mercy of France, Hammond warnsNo-deal Brexit set to hit business for £22bn a yearBrexit has sent ‘not as important’ Britain into decline, says Irish PM“This was an issue that was raised by several members from your group. I very much regret that the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union. But I fully respect this decision. Brexit creates uncertainty for citizens’ rights, for economic and territorial actors, and for the stability and peace on the Island of Ireland.“The withdrawal agreement negotiated with the United Kingdom is the best and only possible deal for an orderly withdrawal. If elected I am ready to pave the way to the ambitious and strategic partnership we want to build with the United Kingdom. Should more time be required, and should there be good reasons provided, I will support a further extension if good reasons are provided.”The suggestion that talks under Article 50\u0026nbspcould be extended will give heart to Remain campaigners\u0026nbspwho believe more time would be needed to organise a second referendum.But some EU national leaders think the bloc should cut Britain adrift and not grant an extension, to end the disruptive affair. The period has already been extended twice and was supposed to expire on 29 March 2019. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister,\u0026nbspsaid last month\u0026nbspEU leaders had run out of patience with Britain and would only support an extension for a general election or second referendum.The confirmation from the the nominee that she would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – a longstanding EU position – clashes with the views of many Tories in Westminster who believe\u0026nbspthe EU can be forced to renegotiate. The Sun newspaper reported on Monday that Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay told the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, five times in a recent meeting that the deal is “dead”. It has been rejected by MPs three times.Whether any extension would take place would be decided by\u0026nbspEU leaders, and Ms von der Leyen is set to take office on 1 November\u0026nbspwhen Jean-Claude Juncker’s mandate expires.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentBoris Johnson has said he would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October “do or die”, but leaks from the civil service suggest it has warned that the UK is not prepared for a no-deal exit on that date. The frontrunner for next prime minister has said he would withhold payment of the Brexit financial settlement to try to force the EU back to the table.Ms Von der Leyen spends the rest of the letter explaining her programme for commission president. Highlights include more ambitious climate targets, “a more growth-friendly fiscal stance” in the euro area, beefed-up provisions for the rule of law, and reforms to the EU processes to make them more democratic. She faces a vote in the European parliament on Tuesday, which she needs to pass to confirm her position as European commission president.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not quite clear how serious they are about all the policies, many of which have been knocking around for ages.The liberal group, which is now called Renew, has also sent a similar letter.Von der Leyen needs 374 votes in the 751-member parliament to win: without the support of the socialist and the liberals – the latter of which have kept quiet for now – she has to rely on Eurosceptic groups to vote for her.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japan\u0027s Megumu Yoshida and Yukiko Inui compete in the duet technical artistic swimming event during the 2019 World Championships at Yeomju Gymnasium in GwangjuHot air balloons fly over the city of Igualada during an early flight as part of the European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain.

There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us,\u0027 says Mounir BaatourClick to followThe IndependentMounir Baatour’s office is cool, the steady thrum of the air conditioner offering a welcome break from the blistering summer heat that has descended upon Tunis. Past noon, little moves outside. The streets are empty and even the city’s ubiquitous cat population has slinked off to the shadows.Despite the temperature, Baatour, the first openly gay man to run for president in a Muslim country, remains focused upon the task ahead.The road leading to the November poll is unlikely to offer a smooth ride. Homosexuality itself isn’t illegal in Tunisia. However, practising it is. This distinction has allowed Baatour, a lawyer, to register the pressure group\u0026nbspShams. Along with others, the group campaigns for a repeal of the colonial French\u0026nbsplaw\u0026nbspproscribing sodomy.Likewise, legal\u0026nbsprestrictions criminalising\u0026nbsp”outrages against public decency” are often used to persecute the country’s LGBT+ population – these\u0026nbspremain firmly with the sights of Baatour and other rights campaigners. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn top of this, the police force appears eager to exploit existing edicts allowing, for instance,\u0026nbspenforced anal examinations to be used as evidence of sexuality. This is buttressed by a judiciary and political establishment long practised in the art of looking the other way.Created with Sketch.Best photos from Pride 2019 around the world Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In February, a young man from the coastal city of Sfax received an eight month\u0026nbspsentence for engaging in homosexual acts after reporting being raped by two other men. Other stories of official abuse are legion. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am openly gay,”\u0026nbspBaatour\u0026nbspsays. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.”Baatour, his association and his relatively fringe Liberal party are children of Tunisia’s revolution. In the years immediately following 2011, a number of gay rights groups emerged, led by Baatour’s own Shams, calling for a repeal of\u0026nbspanti-homosexual laws.However, even here, Shams’ tactics have given rise to ision, with a coalition for LGBT+ rights issuing a statement\u0026nbsplast year distancing themselves from Shams and its president. Baatour attributes this schism to his openness to potentially normalising relations with Israel, a suggestion considered anathema to many on Tunisia’s left.Perhaps ironically, the same period during which many of these groups arose also witnessed an explosion in Islamism across Tunisia, with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party vying with the radical\u0026nbspAnsar al-Sharia\u0026nbspfor the political souls of Tunisia’s religious majority.When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No\u0026nbspAnsar\u0026nbspal-Sharia was outlawed in 2013, and support for Ennahda appears to have ebbed since the groundswell of popular support that saw them achieve a plurality vote in the country’s first free elections in 2011.But across many sections of Tunisian society, values typically bend towards the traditional. In August, conservative demonstrators of both genders took to the street to protest a\u0026nbsppresidentially mandated report\u0026nbspurging greater inidual freedoms and equality across the genders. \u0026nbspAs far as homosexuality is concerned, those conservative sentiments cut deeper. A June 2019 survey by the polling institute Arab Barometer reported that just 7 per cent of Tunisians condoned homosexuality. It’s a sentiment reflected within the rhetoric of some of Baatour’s populist rivals for the presidency. Law professor Kais Saied\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa close second in the polls – he has\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspthat encouraging the spread of homosexuality within the country is a foreign plot. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAlleged rape victim imprisoned for homosexual acts by Tunisian court“I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” says Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practise.“I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalising it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If, as Kais Saied has said, homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?“When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”Though what Baatour is proposing might seem radical, it is not without precedent. In arguing his case, Baatour points to the country’s first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba, who in 1956 introduced landmark laws outlawing polygamy and introducing a code of women’s rights that stands to this day.LGBT activists arrested at unauthorised pride march in Cuba“All of that at the time was controversial, a lot of people said it was against Islam. However, Bourguiba had the political will to impose it. In 1956, Tunisia was more conservative than it is now, but people came to accept it and still do.” \u0026nbspHowever, while accepting that much of the attention on him focuses upon his stance on LGBT+ rights, Baatour is keen to stress that his candidacy is about more.He wants to address many of Tunisia’s underlying ills, from the state enterprises that continue to haemorrhage money, to the vast scale of the country’s informal economy, to the environment, which remains a priority.But above all, he says, is his commitment to promoting civil liberties and the rights of the inidual.Whether or not he is successful remains to be seen.

But in  the CIA officially acknowledged its existence and its location was revealed.Declassied documents reveal it was originally somewhere for the Army Air Corp pilots to practise their aerial gunnery.During the Cold War experimental aircraft and weapons systems were tested here.This included the high altitude U- spy plane.Its current use is unknown and remains a top secret.The so-called Roswell incident is one of the most discussed and controversial UFO theories in history.In July  the military sensationally announced in a press release it had found the remains of a crashed flying saucer in the desert.But the following day it retracted the statement, saying it was in fact a damaged US Air Force air balloon.Yet as reported, Sherf Jess Slaughter and Deputy Sherf Charles Fogus were on duty in a patrol car on the night of the alleged incident. Suddenly they heard reports of a crashed aircraft on their police radio.In the interview Mr Fogus claims he saw a flying saucer smash into the side of a river bed and that the flying object was “ft across”.Describing the scene, he said: “When we got there, the land was covered with soldiers. They were hauling a big, creature.“The bodies must have been  feet tall.“I saw the legs and feet on some of them. They looked like our feet.”The exact purpose of the air base is not known publicly, and the area is heavily restricted.Trespassers can face huge fines and y prison sentences for setting foot in the zone.Purchased by the US government in , evidence suggests the site is used as a testing area for experimental aircraft and weapons.But the secrecy surrounding it has led conspiracy theorists to suggest the area is holding extra-terrestrial secrets.Theories suggest engineers examine crashed spacecrafts — and even hold meetings with aliens from across the galaxy.The crash of a weather balloon at Roswell, New Mexico in  sparked wild theories of an alien ship crash.Some have suggested Area  is still storing parts of the crashed ship — or even its alien inhabitants.As well as assessing alien technology it is often suggested that it is a place where meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials occur.Other theories suggest it has served as a research site for a range of exotic weapons and technologies.This includes the development of time travel or teleportation technologyAnother theory is that the much rumoured Aurora stealth plane is being tested here.The most outlandish idea is that Area  is a base for a one world government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news. MPs have voted to make same-sex marriage legal in Northern Ireland.By a massive margin of  to , the House of Commons backed an amendment demanding the province be brought into line with the rest of the country by October  . . . unless Stormont s and decides otherwise.

Those results came after MPs hijacked a Government Bill in a bid to force through the changes.The DUP has accused them of abusing the impasse at Stormont to impose Westminster’s will. So not everyone is happy with the news.But it’s a big “Hooray!” from me that this kind of right-minded thinking now applies to the whole UK. After all, women have the right to choose what happens to their bodies.And what dference does it make – and whose business is it  – who you love and make love to I FEEL for Donna Bettiss, who is selling her unworn wedding dress after her fiance left her for their wedding planner.Donna, , from Horsham in West Sussex, was devastated when partner James Routledge, , dumped her last year just weeks before their big day.

Leaving your bride-to-be for the wedding planner is NOT a good look.The only consolation – though Donna might not see it quite yet – is that she is almost certainly better off without him.WHEN I heard a Hull mum had called two of her children Jackdaniel and Tiamarie, all I could think was, “poor kids”.But mum Sarah Mennell insists they aren’t named after booze, as she prefers tea.

The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit.

Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying.

Shes the absolute jigger queen.”In stomach-churning scenes Cilian, who remains unflinching, digs out the worm with sharpened wooden stick as Livia explains it has been in her foot for a few days and “its managed to gnaw right through me and create a great big sack of eggs.As the white egg sack oozes out of her skin, she exclaims, “Look at the size of that beast. She [Cilian] absolutely loved that though.”Despite her medical skills, Cilian will not train to be a doctor as the Pygmy children never leave the village for formal education.The wealthier Bantu tribe consider themselves a superior race and have historically kept Pygmies as slaves.A report in  found that the Pygmy tribes were subject to constant discrimination from the Bantus, being made to work for nothing and are “considered by Bantu people as property in the same way that pets are.Livia explains: [Their village] Bonguinda used to be inhabited by the Pygmies and the Bantus.The Bantus moved down to the river to the neighbouring village of Munbalu but this is still Bantu land so they still feel like they have a bit of a hold on [the Pygmies].The relationship between them is really dark.Extreme Tribes: The Last Pygmies airs tonight at pm on Channel .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

election in .He also said there were records suggesting his maternal great-great-great grandfather, Frederick Williams, most likely owned slaves in the s.We are not certain that the Frederick Williams who is my ancestor and the Frederick Williams who owned slaves are the same person, wrote ORourke.But there’s enough circumstantial data to lead me to conclude that it’s likely.He added that records show his we Amy had an ancestor who owned slaves and another who was a member of the Confederate Army.Despite having gained a lot of attention near the start of the race, ORourkes campaign has struggled to build momentum, and Real Clear Politi aggregated polling data currently has him in sixth.ORourke continued: “Something that we’ve been thinking about and talking about in town hall meetings and out on the campaign — the legacy of slavery in the United States — now has a much more personal connection.That those enslaved Americans owned by my ancestors were denied their freedom, denied the ability to amass wealth, denied full civil rights in America after slavery also had long term repercussions for them and their descendants.”“I benefit from a system that my ancestors built to favor themselves at the expense of others.The majority of slaves were transported along the so-called Middle Passage, a triangular trade route between Europe, Africa, and the Americas.Europe traders would depart Europe with manufacture goods which could be traded in Africa for kidnapped Africans.The Africans would then be transported across the Atlantic as slaves.Once on the American continent, they could be sold or traded for raw materials, which would then be transported back to Europe.It is estimated that between  and , . million slaves were shipped to the New World, with . million surviving the journey.The trading of slaves was abolished in the British Empire in , with ownership not outlawed fully until .In the early s, the United States fought a civil war partly over the question of whether slavery should be allowed to continue.In December , the Thirteenth Amemndment to the US Constitution officially outlawed slavery throughout the country.ORourke has previously expressed support for the payment of reparations for African American descendants of slaves, who still today experience lower incomes, worse health outcomes, and higher rates of incarceration.He wrote in the post: “We all need to know our own story as it relates to the national story, much as I am learning mine.It is only then, I believe, that we can take the necessary steps to repair the damage done and stop visiting this injustice on the generations that follow ours.”ORourke says thatelected president he would support a bill that would create a commission to study the question of

We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive.In a joint statement issued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support, but added that all stakeholders should pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions.Speaking ahead of Mondays meeting, Mr Hunt said: The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, butthe dferent parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind.Neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would likely want to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, with the potential to obliterate entire cities, experts have warned.Recent statements from Saudi Arabia has made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran.Iran, meanwhile, has begun exceeding limits on uranium enrichment agreed in the  deal amid frustration in Tehran at theof crippling US economic sanctions.While the Europeans say they still support the agreement - which lted sanctions infor Iran curbing its nuclear programme - in practice they have found it dficult to get round the US measures.The nuclear agreement, agreed upon in , involved a pledge from Iran to reduce its uranium enrichment programme infor a loosening of economic sanctions.The  deal caps Iran’s levels of uranium enriched to . per cent purity—called “low-enriched uranium”.This type of uranium is only suitable for producing fuel for nuclear power reactors—at  kilograms.Highly enriched uranium is needed to produce a nuclear weapon.Obtaining fissile material - such as uranium and plutonium - is widely regarded as the most dficult task in building nuclear weapons.Iran would need , kilograms of low-enriched uranium to make the core of one bomb.This would need to be further enriched, to  per cent purity, using centruges until it had about  kilograms of what is called “highly enriched uranium.”Experts estimate that it would take about a year for Tehran to enrich enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb.This time frame has been backed up by a May  US Congressional Research Report.However other weapons experts have been more hesitant to say Iran is building a nuclear weapon geared to attack.Ky Davenport, the director of nonproleration policy at the Arms Control Association, told Foreign Policy in July: “This is not a dash to a nuclear bomb ... It is a calculated move designed to gain leverage in negotiations with the Europeans, Russia, and China on sanctions relief.”President Trump last year pulled the US out of the agreement - claiming Tehran was violating its obligations and suggesting the deal was too soft.He also threatened to impose the highest level of economic sanction against Iran.The other parties criticised Mr Trumps decision and said they remained committed to the deal.The United States has assessed that Tehran possesses the technological and industrial capacity toBut Iran has not yet mastered all of the necessary technologies for building such weapons.Whether Iran has a viable design for a nuclear weapon is unclear.Although Iran claims that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes, the programLast week, a Royal Navy warship intervened to drive off Iranian patrol boats after they approached a British tanker as it sailed through the Strait of Hormuz.It prompted fears the Iranians were trying to seize a UK ship in retaliation for the detention of the Grace .It was the latest in a series of incidents in the region prompting fears of a slide into all out conflict.In recent weeks, the US has sent thousands of troops, an aircraft carrier, nuclear-capable B- bombers and advanced fighter jets to the Middle East.Iran has also pledged to breach the agreement until it receives the sanctions relief it says it is owed.The deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.It saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.If Iran abided by the deal it was promised relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The agreement was reached on July , , and the world powers signed it in Vienna.The Iran nuclear deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.The deal saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties -

Grandparents Ron and Wendy Long were devastated when they found workmen chopping down a hedge between their home and neighbour Diana Lambethaposs. Ron, , claimed the fence posts they half-installed were on his land, and wrote letters asking her to consult with him on the plans. But instead she took the elderly couple to court, in pursuit of an injunction to stop them interfering with the hedge, in Swanage, Dorset. An independent expert decided the boundary was in the middle of the old hedge - and the Longs agreed in a bid to end the matter.    But despite the Longs representing themselves in court, the judge ordered Ron and Wendy pay Mrs Lambethaposs court costs - £,. Without any money to pay, they were hauled back to court and the charge was placed on their £, three-bed home. Last month they were told Mrs Lambeth intends to take them to court for an order of possession and sale of their home to sell it herself to get the cash. And her lawyers have warned Ron and Wendy theyaposll ask the judge to make the couple pay the legal costs incurred. Retired flooring contractor Ron, said: Weaposve done nothing wrong, we broken no laws, and we followed all the advice we could find - yet we find ourselves in this situation.    When you say all this is over a garden fence, people canapost believe it. Iaposm not out to get revenge. I donapost want to give my neighbour grief. I donapost want to shame my neighbours, but I want to make people aware of what can happen to you. We never thought this could happen to us. We never thought someone could take our home over a hedge. I just want to show people what can happen when solicitors get involved and things go to court. All I want is some help to bring this to a close. We donapost want someone  to sell our home. We feel like we have been stepped all over and nobody has heard our side of things. Ron and Wendy, a housewe, bought their three-bed home in . On friendly terms with neighbour Mrs Lambeth, keen gardener Ron happily maintained his side of the hedge between their homes, he said. But he came home in May  from a morning out to find three workmen in his garden, he claims.    They had cut down half the hedge and piled it in the middle of his garden and were replacing it with fence posts, some of which he said were on his side, he said. I hadnapost given permission for anyone to come on my garden, said Ron. There were great big roots left. Instead of the new fence posts being straight, they were taking the posts around the roots. It looked a mess. Iaposm fond of gardening and I like it to look neat and tidy. Andshe was putting up a fence to keep her dog in, it wasnapost the right sort of fence to do that anyway. It was only a metre high. I told them to stop. He went inside, did some research online and penned a letter to his neighbour, telling her they should have been consulted on the fence location. He said the new fence posts were on his property, but apologised for the letter, assuring his neighbour we hope we can resolve this amicably. But in the coming weeks, the Longs woke up to find someone had removed the rest of the fence while they were asleep. He sent her another letter urging her to sort this out in a civilised fashion.  But after months of letters, the couple were named as the defendants in a County Court boundary dispute claim. According to court documents from June , Mrs Lambeth claimed they were preventing her from putting a fence up. She asked the court to seek a declaration of the boundary, an injunction stopping the Longs from obstructing the fence building, going on her property, or altering any fence. The Longs claim the judge urged them to sort the case outside of court. Fearful and unable to afford a solicitor, they said they agreed in court to the fence, in May . I just didnapost want to take it any further - we never wanted it to get that far, said Ron. But their solicitor just took over. Every time I tried to say anything I got told to sit down. We just didnapost have a chance. I said aposput your boundary wherever you likeapos. They were astonished when the judge ordered all the claimants costs - £,. - were to be covered by them. They hired a solicitor and they hired an expert, but in this very brief hearing itaposs ordered that we have to pay for it all, he said. I could barely take it in. I didnapost - and we still donapost - know what itaposs all for. Their solicitor presented this huge bundle of paperwork and we were handed the bill.  But they werenapost able to pay in full, and were hauled back to court and the charge was transferred to their home in November last year. The couple were already selling their home before the saga started, but took it off the market when the dispute went to court. With it back on the market, they thought the ordeal was behind them. We thought weaposd have to pay back the money when we sold the house, he said. We had a brief moment of calm and thought it was all over. But earlier last monththey received a legal letter from their neighbouraposs solicitors. It states they have been instructed to apply to the court for an order for possession and sale of the Longaposs home, in order to enforce the courtaposs charging order for the debt. The Longs said they canapost get a loan due to the CCJ they incurred by not paying the costs on time. They said they havenapost been able to get help from the Citizens Advice Bureau and solicitors have been reluctant to take on the case.

Tourists visiting the UK are choosing to stay in properties further out of town as opposed to forking out for expensive hotel rooms, according to research. In Manchester, the council recently commissioned a report to assess the impact of Airbnb on the city. They found the Calornia-based company is by far the biggest in the cityaposs short-term rental market, accounting for at least % -with many properties in residential suburbs such as Moss Side, Benchill and Beswick. Although the city centre remains the most popular place for people to stay, growth is quickly expanding into more unexpected places. Council estates that are close to some of the biggest attractions, such as Old Trafford and the Etihad, are fast becoming Airbnb favourites in Manchester, reports the Manchester Evening News. In some cases, Airbnb hosts are benefiting from the regeneration of once-dilapidated estates that have been rebuilt into family homes offered on the open market at favourable rates.    The full impact of the phenomenon is still being assessed by officials, but their initial findings make for a remarkable insight into how some of Manchesteraposs working class neighbourhoods are being transformed. Moss Side has seen Airbnb listings rocket from around  in  to almost  in .  In fact, the neighbourhood has the second highest number of listings on Airbnb in Manchester, way ahead of more affluent suburbs such as Didsbury. When the  Manchester Evening News  searched for places to stay in Moss Side later this year results included two on Quinney Crescent. At the height of the aposGunchesterapos days, the street and surrounding Alexandra Park estate often found itself caught up in gangland feuds. But now tourists are paying to spend the night in properties close to the city centre and the home of Manchester United . One listing on Quinney Crescent costs £ a night and is described as a aposcharming and chicapos apartment. The host, Bayan, adds: A perfect little home in the City for your city break. From here you are well placed to see all that Manchester has to offer - from city centre shopping and restaurants to music venues, sports stadiums and museums and galleries.    Recent guests have left overwhelmingly positive reviews. Nice flat in good location, convenient parking facilities. Would stay again, wrote Clive this month. Hosts communicated well, lovely space in a good location and good amenities nearby. Would highly recommend for a short or longer trip - any queries were resolved quickly, added Gabrielle. The other on Quinney Crescent is described as a aposcomfy and trendy Manchester houseapos and costs £ a night. Host Sam says: Our house is perfect for someone wanting to stay close to the city centre but not right in the middle of it. We have a nice open planned kitchen and living space, with a sizeable back garden and a room perfect for a couple to share. Anyone at all is welcome to stay with us, we love meeting new people and making new friends! Reviews of the area are equally positive. One visitor Laura wrote: Sam is a wonderfully sweet host, lives in a very nice house in a cozy neighbourhood close to the city centre. I loved staying at his place with my mom! The council report also identied areas of east and north Manchester where there is aposhigh demand for visitor accommodation, property type and management.apos    Officials highlighted a modern housing estate called aposThe Wayapos in Beswick. Developer Lovell first began working with the city council in  to replace rows of run-down terraced properties owned by the New East Manchester urban regeneration company. The result is hundreds of new homes that have transformed Beswick and brought le back to an area that had been experiencing signicant unemployment and depopulation. The £million project was only completed last year. However, most of the homes were sold on the open market and it appears a signicant number have been bought up for the purpose of short-term rental. The council report found there are now a staggering  Airbnb listings within one-mile radius - all on the aposThe Wayapos estate. Most hosts advertise their proximity to the Etihad Stadium and city centre and offer accommodation for large groups of up to  guests. The M.E.N found one listing for a -bedroom aposholiday homeapos that could sleep  guests available for £ a night on the weekend of July .  aposHenryapos the host says: This property is close to Manchester city centre, Etihad City Stadium, National Cycling Centre, MEN Arena, University of Manchester. You’ll love my place because of the neighbourhood, the light, the comfy bed, the kitchen, and the cosiness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travellers, families , and big groups.  Such is the success of the flexible, short-term rental market that Manchester is adding new Airbnbs at a rate of more than one every day, the council report found. There are currently around , listings in Manchester, marking a spectacular increase in the past five years - as recently as  there were only a few hundred. In the last two years alone, the city has added a further  Airbnbs. Nevertheless, Manchester remains well behind other big European cities in terms of Airbnbs - there are around , listings in Madrid, , in Rome and , in Paris. Council officials hope that means they have time to get a handle on how it is affected the housing market and what kind of regulation is necessary to curtail the problems that comes with Airbnb. The councilaposs spokesperson for the city centre Pat Karney said: We are not opposed to home owners who let out rooms and homes occassionally. We are totally opposed to the big business Airbnb operators who distort the housing market and cause problems for local residents. We are looking at regulations in cities across the world.

It emerged after pig fat residue was found on pottery shards discovered at Durrington Walls, near Stonehenge .The walls have a long association with feeding the hundreds of people who helped build the landmark. New analysis has found the lard may have originated from bucket-sized dishes which may have been used for the collection and storage of tallow – a form of animal fat. It could then have been used to lubricate the sledges as they dragged the monoliths into place - a mystery that has long baffled historians.  Dr Lisa-Marie Shillito, a senior lecturer in landscape archaeology at Newcastle University, said: I was interested in the exceptional level of preservation and high quantities of lipids – or fatty residues - we recovered from the pottery. I wanted to know more about why we see these high quantities of pig fat in pottery, when the animal bones that have been excavated at the site show that many of the pigs were aposspit-roastedapos, rather than chopped up as you would expectthey were being cooked in the pots.

Although shrouded in mystery, it is generally accepted they were moved by human effort - with most theories believing the rocks originated from Wales.

As soon as we stepped on the plane it was obvious they were going to get rowdy.

We were boarding and were hoping that we were sitting a long way away from them but when we got to our seats we were right in the middle of them. I fly a lot but I almost got off the plane.

The cabin crew made an announcement that it wasnapost too late to get them off the flight. It appeared that they had smuggled their own alcohol on the plane. They kept needing to use the toilet even when the seatbelt sign was on. They didnapost do anything they were told and the pilot in the end kept the seatbelt sign on in an attempt to try and keep them in their seats. In the end the cabin crew moved us. One of the group then started verbally abusing a male member of staff and kept calling him a aposnonceapos. He was screaming in the manaposs face. He was directed back to his seat but kept coming back. At one point he sat in the lap of a woman. It was offensive. Everyone was saying it was the worst flight ever. It was frightening and deeply uncomfortable. I was scared. It was really, really scary. It was the worst kind of disorder you can imagine apart from the fact it was happening ,ft in the air and there was nothing we could do. When the flight landed passengers were told to remain in their seats so police could come on the plane. The police met us when we landed. One of the group thought he would just ignore the instruction and saw his opportunity to get off the plane quickly, said another passenger. But when he walked down the steps he was met by officers.

Amy Grfith, , moved to Essex from London in  with the sole intention of completely transforming the property both internally and externally. The house boasts dozens of stylish rooms, including six bedrooms, each designed completely dferently - from the saloon and space-inspired kitchen to floral staircases and unicorns in the garden. Amy, an artist and creative director originally from Calornia, USA, said: It is inspired by the past, the present and the future as well as more specic things such as art, fashion, music, nature, the universe and of course overall the king of emotion and answer to pretty much everything - love.    Itaposs hard for me personally to comment on what it is like to experience the house as an outsider because I created it and it is my reality. The feedback we get from many guests is that it is an aspirational and inspirational place that is often described a dreamlike and otherworldly escape. The amazing house is available to stay in and hire out by making contact through their website. It has been used for television opportunities, photo shoots and music videos. It was recently featured in Little Mixaposs aposBounce Backapos music video.    Amy added: There is no specic price tag for hiring the dream house each quote is tailored depending on whether it is for commercial or personal use, how many guests there are, and what optional extras are asked for. Guests attending have to be over  but this can y depending on the kind of event that is hosted and the occasion. The quirky house includes lots of funky features such as leopard print wallpaper, floral walls, a pink quilted bed and a waterfall painted on the back of the house.  Amy added: Almost all of our furniture is recycled from charity shops which I like to support, as well as car boot sales, and eBay, I prefer to buy things secondhand as they have a story and so much character, I am naturally drawn to that sort of history. Iaposm obsessed with making things so Iaposve made a lot of it too! Every room is my favourite for dferent reasons, but ultimately I see the house as one piece and a total experience. It is a privilege as an artist to be able to create something on this scale and I appreciate every day.  Fortunately, as time has passed, the neighbours now have a better understanding of what the houseaposs creative purpose is and it has become a part of Tiptree. Iaposm very excited for whataposs next - the time has come to move one and create something new.

While at the beginning of their relationship, negative comments from strangers bothered them, they have learned to ignore them.    People still appear shocked when they see them together and find out they are in a relationship, as they mistake them for father and daughter, with Eddieaposs twin daughters being  years old.

When he asked her on a first date last month, Erica was honest and said she was too strapped for cash so he offered to pay. On the date, Phillip told her she owed him a beer but two days later he demanded she pay him back for the drink - so Erica transferred for the beer and the tip, she claims.  When the relationship failed to blossom Phillip turned nasty and branded her a half Jew for only paying  towards the date - and sent aposnoseapos emojis as a racial slur. Professional er Erica blocked Phillip and later got her own back by sending him a bill for for gas, wasting my time and burdening me with the knowledge of your existence. Erica, from San Diego, Calornia, said: I donapost knowhe can even admit to himself what happened, but itaposs not my problem. The trash took itself out, as I like to say.  I am half Jewish. It comes up in conversation a lot because I am adopted and found my birth father when I was  and I learned I was half Jewish then. I also did andme and I am .% Ashkenazi Jewish. It tells people a lot about me so when Iaposm getting to know someone it comes up. The fact that I am Jewish must have really struck him. Despite it being a problem that he lived far away, Erica claims she had fun on their initial date and continued chatting to Phillip for five more days. However she claims he was insecure and constantly fretted that she was going to aposghostapos him.  The final straw was when he revealed he owned a aposno fat chicksapos t-shirt, which left Erica annoyed - sending Phillip into a rage. He wrote to her: Lol you really are half Jew I spent  on Sunday and you send me . Erica replied: Okay. You can f off. [ghost emoji]. Phillip wrote: Youaposre joke responses of lol and pretending to be broke @  basically says that anyway haha [sic]. Know what Iaposm saying  [three nose emojis]. Upset and angry at the blatant anti-Semitism, Erica blocked Phillip and sent him the tongue-in-cheek bill via mobile payment service Venmo asking for him to cover her petrol and wasted time.  Erica said: The nose emojis made it even worse. I had not said anything rude to him other than that I hated the [no fat chicks] shirt but it was a rude comment on his part to make before that. I definitely feel like the Jewish comments were very rude of him. I definitely feel like I have a distinctive nose but I donapost have that big a nose. I like my nose. He shouldnapost attack part of me, especially a bit I like. When I was younger I was self-conscious of my nose but as an adult I realised I liked it. Luckily it wasnapost a huge insecurity point for me but it was shocking that he could go that far. Although she claims she never expected him to pay the Venmo bill, she found the response cathartic. Erica said: The text I got on the final day was a picture of him in the aposno fat chicksapos t-shirt. He hadnapost mentioned it at all and I had no idea he owned a shirt like that or anything like that.  He was already annoying me because he was texting me so much and harassing me about ghosting him even though I never ghosted or rejected him, so when he sent the picture of that shirt I was already frustrated. I told him I hated the shirt. I just think heaposs really insecure so the second he saw something negative - that was the first time I texted something negative - he just lashed out immediately. I was just like, ok, Iaposm not going to tell you I like your shirt when I donapost. It was very bizarre. Then he said that comment, which was very anti-Semetic and I was not expecting that. I was surprised at how much it affected my emotions even though I didnapost know him very well. Iaposm not usually a very sensitive person but he sent that text at  oaposclock in the morning and I was at work. I was thinking about it all day, just, wow, that hurt. I didnapost know him at all but I just told him to aposf offapos and sent him the ghost emoji and blocked his number. I blocked him right then.

win over Finns RoPS in the first leg of the Europa League first qualying round.Ferguson played in a deep-lying midfield role last week and the versatile Gallagher operated in front of him in a more advanced central midfield position for much of the game.In the second period the -year-old spent more time on the left wing.But throughout the game Gallagher was a threat for the Dons due to his pace and willingness to take on defenders.He set up the Reds’ second goal with Sam Cosgrove turning in his pin-point cross.Ferguson was impressed with the summer addition and said: “He’s all over the park and he’s so quick and athletic.“Jon slotted straight into position on Thursday and I thought he was excellent.“He had so much energy and was driving forward with the ball and even in the last  minutes he was still driving forward and showed he was a real good ball carrier.“He could have added a goal which would have topped it off – but he was excellent.”Aberdeen were in command against RoPS, leading - at Pittodrie.But Tommi Jantti’s stoppage-time strike took the shine off the performance for Derek McInnes’ side.It also means progression to face either CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg or Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere is not yet assured.However, Ferguson believes a similar display in Thursday’sleg in Lapland to the one the Dons produced in the Granite City should be enough to see them through.The -year-old added: “I thought we controlled the game very well and I thought the standard of football was excellent.“We played really good stuff, especially in the final third.“We created more than enough chances to come in at - or -.“There wasn’t that clinical finishing to put more of the chances away and sadly we’re talking about slack defending at the end that cost us a goal.“I’m pretty confidentwe go over there and play the same type of football with that intensity that we’ll come away with a victory.“They’re a good side and they’re in this competition for a reason.“Their goal was a quality bit of football and that’s what happens in Europe, a split-second can cost you.“ we play with the intensity and energy of Thursday I’m confident we can get through the tie.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/GettyImages-959250288.jpg ","title":"i saw the city and saw how big the club was and i thought this was the right step ojo","story":"Dons new boy Funso Ojo has hailed boss Derek McInnes’ powers of persuasion.The midfielder has joined Aberdeen on a three-year-contract from Scunthorpe United.The Reds paid the English League Two side £, for the -year-old Belgian.He becomes Aberdeen’s eighth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Ryan Hedges, Ash Taylor, Curtis Main, Craig Bryson, Jon Gallagher, Greg Leigh and James Wilson.However, the Dons were not the only club chasing Ojo.Scottish Premiership rivals Hibs also had a £, offer accepted by Scunthorpe, but the former PSV Eindhoven, Dordrecht and Willem II player chose Aberdeen.After coming to the Granite City on Friday for discussions with McInnes Ojo was convinced to join the Reds.When asked about his reasons for choosing the Dons, Ojo said: “All the effort they put into it. At first I did my research online and spoke to certain players.“I didn’t really want to come up at first based on what people told me, but that’s another lesson I’ve learned.“I’m , but I’m still learning, and you have to come up and see things for yourself and get your own impression.“When I came up I spoke to the gaffer. Russ Richardson also had a big part to play.“I saw the city and saw how big the club was and I thought this was the right step for me in my career.“Hewas influential because I was in Edinburgh and he was still ringing me.“He wanted to come and get me from Edinburgh in the middle of the night.“I said: ‘I’ll come up, I’ll drive myself, don’t worry about it.’“I came up and he spent a full day with me which made me feel welcome.“We had talks about football and not only about football because there is more in le than football.“He touched something in me and was influential in my decision.”Ojo was also shown Aberdeen’s new training complex at Kingsford which is scheduled for completion in October.He added: “That was impressive.“I’ve been at some nice training grounds. But I’m looking forward to this one because everything is going to be new.”Aberdeen boss McInnes is delighted to have landed Ojo.With Bryson recovering from an ankle ligament problem and Stephen Gleeson out after knee surgery the Pittodrie gaffer felt he needed to strengthen the central midfield area.McInnes said: “I couldn’t be more pleased to get Funso. He is a player who will fulfil a key position within my squad.“He is a very talented player and I am delighted he has decided to come and work with us at Aberdeen. He is as excited as we are about working together and it is satisfying that he sees Aberdeen as the best  for his future career.”Another attraction for Ojo was the chance to play in the Europa League.He is ineligible for Thursday’s first qualying round second leg against RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland.But with the Dons leading - from the first leg Ojo hopes they can progress to face Luxembourg’s CS Fola Esch or Georgia’s Chikhura Sachkhere in the second qualying round.He added: “That’s a massive attraction because I’ve played in Europe at my first cluband I’ve not been in Europe since.“The Champions League is the highest level but the Europa League is just under it.“That was a massive attraction and I want to push the lads to get through on Thursday and then we’ll have more games.“Hopefully I can get some games in Europe and we can get to the group stages.”Ojo started his career with PSV in the Netherlands before spells with Belgian sides Beerschott and Antwerp.He then turned out for Dordrecht and Willem II before a switch to Scunthorpe two years ago.Given his list of former clubs the Red Army may not to be too familiar with how Ojo plays.But he said: “I want to have the ball at my feet and dictate the game.“I want to be the link between the manager and the pitch – slow down the game and speed it up.“I’m a player who makes others around me better.“I won’t be the stand-out player that people come to the stadium for.“But I will make sure that the players that people come to watch perform to a really high level.“I will get the ball to them and make them do what they do.”Meanwhile, Aberdeen have also been linked with free agent midfielder James Morrison.The Scotland international is available after leaving West Brom following  years at the Hawthorns.Hibs and Hearts are also reportedly interested in the -year-old and given the Dons have secured Ojo a move for Morrison may seem unlikely."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/5d28a5ecf1cb78.39234039.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet hunter skyler and simba are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This happy boy is Hunter and he is  months old.Hunter is a happy, excitable boy with a lot of love to give.He will need a patient owner to continue with his training inside and outside the house.He can get excited and for that reason would not be suitable around small young children.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund. They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

So when Police Scotland officers employ Anglo-Saxon colloquialisms in the course ofduty, I must always assume it has been a wholly justiable belittling of female genitalia.The officerrsquos inquiry had apparently been deployed to ascertain the character of one particularly disruptive inidual ndash who was scurrilously attempting to spoil the buoyant mood of a glorious loyalist parade by blasting ldquorebel music from his car. How he got so close to these patriotic footsoldiers and joy-fuelled revellers with all the city-centre roads closed off, surrounded by motorway tailbacks, I have no idea. A truly disruptive person indeed.:Catholic Church and Orange Order move to ease tensions on Glasgow Orange WalksOn these thankfully rare occasions, when officers of the law cross the line and let vile sexual crudities slip, I believe we must put our shock to one side and attempt to understand the context of such outbursts. And, as always, it seems all blame can be directed towardsthe fractured and Godless nature of todayrsquos society, where indference toine retribution has led to standards of the Queenrsquos English falling lower than the groin glands of the snake in the Garden of Eden.Itrsquos a truly sad day when the only way a dutul servant of Her Majesty can impose their authority is to attempt communicationwith these primitive creatures in their native tongue.The ides of marchDespite thisdisruption, it was wholly invigorating to witness so many of Her Majestyrsquos loyal defenders stride valiantly and gallantly through the city streets, glorying the Union as their ominous tribal thump echoed around the so-called Dear Green Place!It certainly filled my heart with optimism for the nationrsquos future.There were only eight arrests and apart from that, all more or less passed without incident.

Or the woman fallingfoul of the strictly-observed ldquodonrsquot cross the march rule who was shoved and spat on, butshe should perhapsbe grateful tohave DNA for any forthcoming trial. At least it wasnrsquot a Catholic priest this year!Although there was a distinct lack of reportage on this exuberantannual celebration in the mainstream media ndash even in the so-called unionist press ndash I can confirm this was a rousing, joyous, inclusive, family parade. This was evident in the child-friendly aesthetic of Disney-like toy soldier unorms, comedygoose-stepping and Les Dawson-style musical timing ndash performed by men all clearly in robust health despite their advanced years, with the beetroot hue on their faces indicative of a burning internalpassion.Indeed, the jubilant onlookers could have lit cigarettes off the marchersrsquocheeksthey had so wished, an act perhapssymbolicof the undying torch flame of unionist fervourpassed on through countlessfuture generations.On the evidence of this annual celebration of inherited reality tunnels, it will surely not be long until Orangefest ndash first and last held in  ndash makes a triumphantto George Square.

Clearly then, it is somehow perfectly acceptable for nationalists to shout loudly about womenrsquos genitals in Ayr ndash but heaven forbid you are a loyal servant of Her Majesty doing the same thing in Glasgow while simply trying to maintain Order!And finally...YOU might be aware of yet another march that took place on the same day ndash Pridein London.

Is it the thin end of a wedge  Municipal neglect has a habit of creeping outwards like a bad stain.And so wersquore heartened to see some benign citizen development up on the Gallowgate at the old Bairdrsquos Bar next door to Barrowland. This is the cleverest, the most respectful of renovations. Residues of Celtic green paint cling to the ceiling. The materials- dark wood , brick, sandstone, clunking Victorian iron, obscure glass- encapsulate Glasgowrsquos vernacular architecture for me. Whatever was sound has been kept along with the odd bit of evocative whimsy. The old tenement stairs that now lead to nowhere have been kept above the bar. You pass a deep ceramic sink for washing clothes, the sort that was once commonplace in old ldquosteamies\". Such artacts are on display at the Peoplersquos Palace, and  Gallowgate only adds to the collection.In other ways  Gallowgate marches to its own tune, eschewing copycat menus. Its offering manages to be original, yet it fits its setting and location: simple, unfussy dishes, forgotten classics, such as corned beef hash, at reasonable prices that are realistic for its neighbourhood.Everything that reasonably can be is made in the kitchen, apart from the sourdough bread from the Freedom Bakery, and only ace bakers could better that. But the kitchen cures its own salt beef, we discover, as we kick off with the meaty, peppery salt beef fritters perched on frills of amiably mild sauerkraut, napped by punchy Reuben sauce and melting cheese.  Gallowgate clearly isnrsquot immune to cooking trends though. On todayrsquos specials menu therersquos caullower, pale-roasted, in a tumble of mint leaves, pea shoots, soft soaked raisins, toasted pine kernels, and grated Manchego cheese with perhaps a bit of sherry vinegar in its dressing, an idea I intend to steal for home cooking purposes.Boiled gammon and buttered cabbage with spring onion mash  Itrsquos got to be well done, or itrsquos dull. But this ham is a dream, not too salty, with a pale pink blush, it disintegrates in the mouth. The scallions, and a generous dosage of butter, make the mash unctuous the cabbage, Savoy Irsquod say, glistens with even more butter. No complaints from me on that last point.For pound, our hot salt beef sandwich is a steal. Our second chance to taste the succulent, well balanced cured beef, to appreciate just how well that Freedom Bakery bread with its tangible, but not overly chewy, crust works brilliantly in this context. Pickled cucumber spikes the meat and bread with vinegary sharpness while creamy horseradish lubricates it. Out of curiosity we have ordered a side of vinegar peas, another historical homage: back in the day they used to be sold to the Barrowland crowds from a whole in the wall eatery next door. Actually, these are broad beans, and a couple is enough for me, but they come with more sourdough and a pat of French butter. For pound, wersquore not complaining.Our servers are jolly and their enthusiasm for the deep fried custard, which turns out to be more like a doughnut with a custard core, is infectious. But wersquore more smitten with the rhubarb and ginger crumble, its deep layer of stem ginger-spiked fruit, its knobbly, crunchy topping.The people who opened  Gallowgate seem to get old Glasgow, its mood, its character, it value.

And Mr Wilson always knows when it is going to get bad, a day or two after the heavens open.There had been no history of flooding on the property on Eastfield Avenue, where Mr Wilson has lived for  years. What changed  The Hawthorn Estate was built.Murray Wilson in his cellar, picture by Colin MearnsJust up the a brae from his semi are neat rows of tightly packed new-build white homes. This used to be a grassy, partially wooded hill. Now it is asphalted over.Everybody knows this is where the water comes from. Mr Wilson, clutching a small plastic container, explains how. ldquoThis is dye, he says. ldquoWorkers came and poured in to drains up in the Hawthorn estate. And, sure enough, it eventually turned up here.The hill acted ldquolike a sponge, Mr Wilson says. ldquoIt was a natural green belt. I never thought there would be houses on it because it was a slope.Barratt was the builder. They have been trying to fix snagging on their drains for years. Things, Mr Wilson says, are getting better. The flooding is not as extreme was it once was.FULL STORY:Thousands of Scots in legal limbo as roads unadoptedThe local council, South Lanarkshire, has not been, so far, impressed. Officials have sucked their teeth and told Barratt they will not ldquoadopt the roads until the drainage problems are solved.How Mr Wilson pumps out his cellarWhich means that a decade after the white houses went up, the roads, Hawthorn Way and Hawthorn Avenue, are still the responsibility of the builder, not the council.These streets are among hundreds in Scotland stuck in a legal limbo between developers and councils.Mr Wilson is also in a kind of limbo.

In England similar issues have hit house prices and left whole communities with substandard services. In Scotland - where there are thought to be some , new homes on streets still to be adopted - the issues has barely been recognised.Mr Wilson says: ldquoThroughout Scotland there are lots of people who buy a house and think everything is fine, the drainage is fine and the road is adopted.ldquoBut then - lo and behold - it turns out they are not because they have not submitted the proper drawings or it is not fit for purpose.FULL STORY:Thousands of Scots in legal limbo as roads unadoptedThere is hope of a resolution in the Cambuslang case. Gordon Mackay, Head of Roads and Transportation at South Lanarkshire Council, told The Herald ldquoWe are in dialogue with Barratt Homes and Scottish Water in an attempt to have them resolve the outstanding deficiencies in the drainage system that would allow Hawthorn Way and Hawthorn Avenue to be adopted. We are currently awaiting confirmation that necessary remedial works have been satisfactorily completed.Hawthorn EstateDavid Scott, managing director, Barratt West Scotland said: ldquoWe are working with Scottish Water and South Lanarkshire Council to resolve offsite works to improve the drainage, which will hopefully be completed by year end, allowing the local authority to take ownership of the roads affected.

So more than ,likely to be with an adoption problem.\"Ever since  Scottish councils have taken over privately built roads from housing developers - as long as they meet standards.Public sector insiders stress that adoption can be a long and drawn-out process as roads officials pressurise developers to get their streets up to scratch.Cash-strapped councils already have a huge backlog in roads and lighting repairs and do no want to take on extra work and costs that should have been done by private builders.Getting precise figures on how many people or homes are affected by non-adopted roads is almost impossible.That is because dferent councils count the issue in dferent ways. Glasgow, for example, as of , had  development sites were roads were not adopted. Neighbouring East Dunbartonshire had  developments with around  homes. Falkirk, again as of , had one road that was still to be adopted  years after it was built.This is on top of the many pre- private roads already scattered across Scotland - where homeowners are expected to pay the upkeep.Stewart Turner, of the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, chairs the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland. He said: \"Owners of private roads may request that their road be adopted by the roads authority and provided this road joins the public road and it is to a standard acceptable to the roads authority, then it would be adopted.\"Also roads authorities may ask the frontagers of private roads to make improvement and they may,they consider appropriate, contribute to this cost. \"Throughout Scotland the ious Roads Authorities have a dferent approach to this power.\"However taking into account the Roads Authoritiesrsquo primary responsibility to maintain the public roads then it is considered important that the available resource is directed to the public roads. Additional financial resource would be required to improve the extensive private road network.\"Mr Sutton has been in a y correspondence with the Scottish Government over what he sees as its failure to keep track of the scale of the issue.A spokesman for the government said: \"We do not collect information on roadsrsquo adoption status, as that is a matter for local authorities, who are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of roads they have adopted.\"Un-adopted or private roads are the responsibility of housing developers or private home owners, who should consult their relevant local authority on adoption arrangements.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sophy-ridge-andrew-marr-sunday-politics-scotland-review","story":"First to come a cropper was Sky News journalist Niall Paterson, standing in for a holidaying Sophy Ridge. The Scot, from Alloway, had clearly not read Sunday Breakfast Show Presenting for Dummies.We know this because at ., an hour before the show was due to start, he had spilled ketchup down the front of his trousers. How did we know  Because a helpful colleague had posted a video of Paterson frantically trying to clean the stain.The lesson of the story was: thou shalt not have breakfast while wearing your on air outfit. It was his birthday, too. Happily, there was a change of fortune on the way with guest Gina Miller gting Paterson a scoop. Miller was the businesswoman who ensured the UK parliament had its say before the Brexit process could begin. She was now ldquoreassembling her legal team, which made them sound like The Avengers, to fight any attempt to prorogue parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit.A letter had been sent last Thursday to Boris Johnson, she revealed, telling him that suspending parliament would be an abuse of a Prime Ministerrsquos powers and as such would provoke legal action.The face on which egg had been liberally smeared belonged to Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner of the politan Police, who suggested journalists could be prosecuted for publishing leaked documents. The Sunday papers were outraged, and television then picked up the baton, with almost every guest asked to choose a side between the plucky, freedom defending media or the police. No-one chose the latter.The weekrsquos other main story, the continuing row over antisemitism in Labour, was chewed over again. On Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Dame Margaret Hodge said she felt ldquodevastated on watching the Panorama programme featuring eight whistleblowers from the party. Why not just quit, Paterson asked. Dame Margaret said her relationship with Labour had been like a marriage: while the last three years had been terrible, she had had  years of complete happiness.Paterson continued the marriage theme by saying that finding out your other half was antisemitic might be considered reasonable grounds for orce.Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry was in a similarly mournful mode on The Andrew Marr Show. ldquoNobody can pretend that there isnrsquot an ongoing problem within the Labour Party about antisemitism, about our processes for dealing with it, she said.: Scottish Labour attackedLike Dame Margaret, she thought it was wrong to set lawyers on the whistleblowers. ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be going for the messengers, we should be looking at the message.On Marr, the editor of The Spectator, Fraser Nelson, said Labour was in a state of civil war, split between Jeremy Corbyn and the membership on one side and Tom Watson and MPs on the other. ldquoThey are going to go at each other all summer. It is just going to get worse.Marrrsquos main guest was Amber Rudd, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Given she had now accepted no-deal Brexit as an option, having previously voted against, Marr wanted to knowthis was an elegant pivot towards reality or a screeching careerist U-turn.

Itrsquos too much. I know that now but itrsquos a bit late.He is, though,chairman of his hometown football club, Cowdenbeath FC, but admits there is ldquono pleasure in the role, adding: ldquoIf you look to see the record of Cowdenbeath... you will see that this is another burden I have to carry around with me.He also says that everyone is entitled to a defence, but admits there is a downside to his position: ldquoIf you believe in the legal system, you believe that everyone is entitled to a defence. Then you canrsquot pick and choose.ldquoYou canrsquot say, lsquoWell, Irsquoll defend somebody who does this, but Irsquom not going to defend somebody who commits a sexual offence or a mass murder, or whatever, because thatrsquos just not right.\"You take on somebody whorsquos accused of crime and you defend them in respect of that crime.But he admits to finding it ldquodficult sometimes due to how up-close-and-personal his position takes him to mans inhumanity to man.One of his most successful defences was that of former gangster Paul Ferris, who in  was found not guilty of all seven charges against him, including that of murdering Arthur Thompson Jr.He also defended Mitchell, who in  was sentenced to le imprisonment for murdering his -year-old girlfriend, Jodi Jones, and Tobin. Now , he will die in jail, having been convicted of the murders of Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in , Vicky Hamilton in  and Dina McNicol in .Tobin also features in the Crime Files series, in which Professor Wilson, who grew up in Carluke, maintains the killer is also infamous Barras dance hall murderer Bible John.:How Craig Whytes QC Donald Findlay had the fraud trial jury laughingFindlay says: ldquoI do worry. I worry about what is happening during a trial. I tend to take work home with me, and after a trialthe client has been convicted then I worry that perhaps I could or should have done better.\"But during a trial you do see some pretty horrendous things. Manrsquos inhumanity to man is pretty endless and you just have to harden yourself and look as it as best as you can as a piece of evidence.ldquoBut some things I have looked at can be quite distressing, involving dead children and so on.As a seven-year-old in the s, it was reading about Manuel that lead him toward his career. The US-born serial killer, who moved to Uddingston, Lanarkshire, was convicted of murdering seven people across Lanarkshire and southern Scotland between  and his arrest in January , but is thought to have murdered two more.Earlier this year, Findlay narrated an audiobook detailing the le of Manuel, who was taken to the gallows at Barlinnie in  after one of the most sensationalist trials in legal history that saw him sack his lawyers and conduct his own defence.When the -hour audiobook, Manuel: Portrait of a Serial Killer, was released, Findlay said: \"The Manuel case fascinated me since I was a child. As a seven-year-old, I read every word that was reported.\"The challenge of representing someone faced with so many serious charges is one of the reasons I became a defence lawyer.\"Findlay also says during the programme that the increasing use of science by prosecutors in court cases is a \"very real concern\", in part because some can form views by watching TV.He says: ldquoOne problem is, members of the public get a lot of their science from CSI: Miami and New York and all these kind of things. And thatrsquos not real. But thatrsquos the impression you get.ldquoPeople think itrsquos as simple as that but, of course, itrsquos not.

And it could soon be that would-be wizards wonrsquot be clothing themselves in wool at all as the company looks to make a switch away from animal fibres to plant-based or synthetic wools.Cashmere wool is a fibre obtained from special types of goats, rather than wool from sheep and lambs. Company director Keith Murray said that it was becoming increasingly problematic to source high-quality strands as much of the wool which claims to be cashmere is too poor quality to be sold in the UK.:Harry Potter revealed as most inspirational character in childrens literatureThe firm has been cutting the amount it uses for a number of years, and now agreed with Peta that it was time to phase it out entirely.Mr Murray said: ldquoPeta get a bad rap, but they are decent enough people. They showed us their research and we have made a conscious decision that we wonrsquot go back to using cashmere.ldquoWe use British wool and it has to be the best quality possible, so it doesnrsquot make sense to use low-quality wool claiming to be cashmere any more.Lochaven, which is based in Stewarton, was set up by the Red Cross after the Second World War for employment of disabled former servicemen and over the years it has became part of the Haven products charity. But it lost its charitable status and the loss of a major customer saw it enter receivership in .Mr Murray, who previously specialised in helping distressed companies, noticed signed photos of the cast of Harry Potter during a visit to the factory, and found out Lochavenrsquos connection to the series. The firm had never marketed the products, and after a takeover, which saw all jobs saved, Mr Murray proceeded to take them down that road.Now Lochaven supplies garments to Warner Bros, which sells them via its website, and in upmarket retailers throughout Europe and Japan.:Row over ten day closure of Harry Potter-featured West Highland LineThe official Wizarding World theme park in Orlando began stocking Harry Potter knitwear in  ndash and dressing its staff in their outfits ndash and the Harry Potter studio tour at Leavesden studios in London followed in , then Diagon Alley Orlando and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Osaka, Japan, opened in . One of Lochavenrsquos busiest Harry Potter outlets is Platform frac at Kingrsquos Cross Station in London.A spokesman at Lochaven added: ldquoApart from the Harry Potter products we also work with some of the best-known clothing brands in the world and later this year will be launching a range with a hugely popular Japanese brand made from  per cent animal-free fibre. A recent Peta Asia video investigation conducted on cashmere farms and in abattoirs in China and Mongolia ndash the two countries responsible for  per cent of the worldrsquos cashmere production ndash showed workers pinning down crying goats as their legs were bent and their hair was torn out with sharp metal combs.In China, goats deemed no longer profitable were slaughtered after workers hit them on the head with a hammer in an attempt to stun them. And in Mongolia, workers dragged them by one leg on to the abattoir floor before slitting their throats.ldquoGentle goatsrsquo hair is torn out and the animals are hit with hammers and hacked to death, all for cashmere sweaters and scarves, says Peta director Elisa Allen.ldquoLochaven International of Scotland has just stood up to cruelty to animals in a huge way, and Peta is urging all other clothing companies to follow its compassionate, business-savvy lead and go cashmere-free."},{"url":null,"title":"poldark-series-5-episode-1-review","story":"BBC****NO more of Rossrsquos smouldering peepers, farewell the soft tumble of Demelzarsquos titian curls.

So how can we try and change our culture to a more cycling-friendly one Therersquos no quick solution to this one, but after infrastructure and enforcement, education is a key element of an effective road safety strategy because misconceptions and myths about cycling contribute to a culture of conflict on the roads.ldquoCyclists donrsquot pay road tax is a statement often used to explain why some people feel they, as drivers, have more rights on the roads. The reality is road tax ended in the s, and we all pay for the roads through general or local taxation. Vehicle Excise Duty is based on vehicle emissions .A second myth is that there isnrsquot cycle proficiency training in schools any more. In reality, Bikeability Scotland cycling training is giving children the skills and confidence to cycle safely. At least , children are trained each year and all children are able to receive free training.Another common misunderstanding is over road positioning. You should cycle away from the gutter. Itrsquos legal to cycle in the middle of the lane and sometimes itrsquos the safest place, For instancethe road is narrow and itrsquos unsafe for a car to pass, when approaching a junction or to avoid potholes or doors of parked cars being opened in your path.We often hear the argument that bad behaviour, or perceived arrogance, from people cycling provokes careless or dangerous driving and that safety would improveldquocyclists behaved better. Red-light running, to take an oft-cited example of cycling behaviour, is wrong, whether cycling or driving, and too many people do it. But itrsquos not acceptable or logical to hold all people cycling responsible simply because they use the same mode of transport. ldquoCyclists are not a homogenous group but inidual people, just as drivers are.The fact is that many people who cycle are being intimidated, injured or worse, while cycling correctly. And are we really suggesting that someone who is cycling irresponsibly deserves a near-death experience Ultimately, resentful attitudes towards ldquocyclists shouldnrsquot influence actual driving behaviour. People on bikes are undeniably more vulnerable on roads than people in vehicles. Driving too close is a careless or dangerous driving offence because it can kill or seriously injure someone.Almost everyonersquos behaviour ndash including some people who cycle ndash has room for improvement to create a cycle of acceptance, and remove the perception of two tribes going to war on the roads or shared use paths.ldquoWhat about them  Deal with their behaviour first  is never an excuse for careless or dangerous behaviour by anyone. Myths and misconceptions about people cycling need to be banished and enforcement has to focus on the behaviours with greatest potential for harm, just as the Police Operation Close Pass does. Expanding cycling infrastructure is the key priority, creating dedicated space for cycling, to the benefit of everyone.We have a long way to go but quick change is possible. With the increased investment in cycle infrastructure, an increased focus on access to bikes, and greater education and understanding to create a cycle of acceptance, a cycling-friendly nation is no longer an impossible dream."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-tensions-london-edinburgh-going-get-far-worse","story":"Discovering how well this had gone down with the easily pleased hacks, Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy tried to outdo him the following year by providing a slap-up curry at his own festive bash.This was before austerity started to bite and relationships soured: by the time Mr Salmond left office, journalists were treated to bowls of crisps in the basement of St Andrewrsquos House.:Marianne Taylor: The SNP is right to back abortion in Northern IrelandBut during the three years when Scotland had an SNP government in Edinburgh, and a Labour government in Westminster, there was a newfound rivalry between the Scottish Government and the Scotland Office.Until Mr Murphy took over, the job of Scottish Secretary had ndash literally ndash been part-time.When the future Scottish Labour leader was appointed by Gordon Brown, it became the full-time role it is today.According to SNP figures, communications staffing costs for the Scotland Office have soared from around pound, in - to over pound, a decade later, and yesterday there was a fresh row about the departmentrsquos spending on overseas travel.The Nationalists have said this is justication to abolish the department, complaining that itrsquos spending public money \"pumping out propaganda\" promoting Scotlandrsquos place in the UK.The reality, of course, is that this is what governments do. The Scottish Government is also spending public money promoting Scotland with its effective \"Scotland is Now\" tourism campaign ndash ostensibly aimed at a global market, but clearly serving a dual purpose by suggesting to the domestic market that Scotlandrsquos values are distinct.The political tensions that started under Salmond and Murphy have continued, with present incumbent David Mundell facing near-weekly calls from the SNP to resign, often without much of an explanation as to why he should fall on his sword.Intergovernmental relations between the UK and Scottish governments are \"under pressure like never before\", according to SNP MP Pete Wishart.Mr Wishart acknowledged that work between civil servants is \"conducted perfectly well\", and that is certainly what those behind the scenes insist is the case.If there is a problem, then, itrsquos among the politicians, and thatrsquos hardly surprising ndash and not really anything new.It takes two to tango.:Scottish Government cannot guarantee medicine supplies under no-deal BrexitThe SNPrsquos well-worn narrative about a dysal Westminster system doesnrsquot stand up to scrutinythe political leaders work in harmony together. There is every reason for the SNP to be perfectly happy that intergovernmental relations are considered \"under pressure like never before\".After all, the Scottish Governmentrsquos stated aim is independence and the abolition of intergovernmental relations with the UK.But the UK Governmentrsquos stated aim is to preserve the Union, so it is unsurprising that the role of the Scotland Office has steadily increased over the years.Andtensions are strained now, itrsquos only going to get far worse.One of Theresa Mayrsquos final acts of her premiership was to announce a review of the way the UK Government handles the current devolved settlement.That doesnrsquot mean a shake-up of powers as some initially thought it means a sht in mindset for every single UK Government department.Today, Whitehall civil servants are told to ensure their work fits in with the devolution arrangement ndash is the Scottish Government kept engaged  How does the Sewel Convention apply In the future, the questions will be: Does our work strengthen the Union  Or does it potentially advance the case of independence ndash andso, letrsquos think again.Will it make the UK civil service more politicised  Probably.But that happened long ago here in Scotland.Last year, the Scottish Tories complained that civil servants were contacting witnesses ahead of appearances at a Holyrood committee, and highlighted graphics being tweeted by Government accounts which \"used the SNPrsquos party political language\".Valid concerns at the time, but such complaints are likely to appear hypocritical in the near future.And itrsquos not just civil servants who are being told to change their mindset ndash Cabinet ministers are too.The message is clear:the Union is to be saved, the UK Government needs to loosen its purse strings in Scotland, as The Herald exclusively revealed last week.That includes splashing the cash in both reserved and devolved areas ndash the Edinburgh City Deal for example has delivered cash for the capitalrsquos university and the UK Government is helping fund Edinburghrsquos new concert hall, even though culture is devolved.The argument is that such a venue is of cultural importance for the entire UK. Expect much more of the same to follow.Current Chancellor Philip Hammond has been a bulwark against this ever since he moved into Number , arguing that itrsquos unfair on English taxpayers as Scotland already receives its share of funding through the Barnett formula.It means spending money twice over north of the Border, he complains, with some justication.But the order has now gone out loud and clear that this is the price to pay to save the Union.And nobody has done more to achieve this mindset change than David Mundell.He has spent years quietly and effectively persuading his Cabinet colleagues of the risk to the Union and explaining to Whitehall departments they must learn to understand devolution.Next week, just moments before Theresa Mayrsquos final PMQs before she heads to the palace will be the last Scottish Questions before summer.No fan of Boris Johnson, it could be Mr Mundellrsquos last appearance at the despatch box.ButPrime Minister Johnson wants to avoid going down in history as the man who lost the Union, he would be well advised to consider keeping Mr Mundell in post.He should ask himself who does Nicola Sturgeon want as Scottish Secretary  The assured David Mundell or a maverick like Ross Thomson  The First Minister would surely prefer the latter.But whoever is Scottish Secretary, the role is now crucial to Scotlandrsquos constitutional future.Itrsquos a far cry from the part-time job it was before the SNP stormed to power.There will be more money to spend in Scotland far greater UK Government involvement in Scotland ndash and more explosive political rows with the SNP as a result.The great unknown is which government will emerge as the political winner in this latest constitutional battle."},{"url":null,"title":"worst-airline-uk-flight-delays-revealed","story":"The Spanish carrierrsquos UK departures were  minutes late on average in , according to analysis of Civil Aviation Authoritydata by the PA news agency.Thomas Cook Airlines was found to have the second worst performance with flights typically  minutes late, followed by Wizz Air , Norwegian Air UKand Eurowings .:Holidays from hell: your consumer rightsNorwegian Air UK is a British subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, operating transatlantic flights from Gatwick Airport.Cathay Pacic Airways is the most punctual airline, with aircraft typically taking off just eight minutes behind schedule.The average delay across all flights was  minutes.The ranking features the  airlines with more than , flights from UK airports last year.Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmSerco NorthLink has announced plans to enhance accessibility onboard its vessels, with the introduction of fully-equipped #changing places# toilets.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aerogels are already used in several engineering applications, including Nasarsquos Mars exploration rovers.Robin Wordsworth, assistant professor of environmental science and engineering at the Hard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , and the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, said: ldquoThis regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global atmospheric modication.ldquoUnlike the previous ideas to make Mars habitable, this is something that can be developed and tested systematically with materials and technology we already have.Laura Kerber, research scientist at Nasarsquos Jet Propulsion Laboratory, added: ldquoMars is the most habitable planet in our Solar System besides Earth. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Hubble Space Telescope image of Mars--ldquoBut it remains a hostile world for many kinds of le. A system for creating small islands of habitability would allow us to transform Mars in a controlled and scalable way.The material could be used to build habitation domes or even self-contained biospheres on Mars.The researchers were inspired by a phenomenon that already occurs on Mars.Unlike Earthrsquos polar ice caps, which are made of frozen water, polar ice caps on Mars are a combination of water ice and frozen CO.Frozen CO allows sunlight to penetrate while trapping heat.

Not surprisingly, with the majority of the UK’s political focus concentrating on the final stages of the Conservative leadership election, scant attention is being given to how the EU leadership faces its own challenges that should signicantly weaken its hand in dealing with Britain’s departure. Much of our media coverage is exceedingly introverted, displaying an inverted chauvinism that likes nothing better than doing our own country down, especially suggesting the end of our world is nigh. This is counterbalanced only by patriotic sports coverage always looking for new British heroes.This confusing concoction can give a  political perspective and a tendency to underestimate the signicant influence our country has, how popular it is and how our politicians might have a better hand in any negotiations than we appreciate. When confronted by a new British prime minister – most likely to be a bullish Boris Johnson who will be thinking, let’s get the job done or I’ll be out on my ear tout suite – I expect him to highlight the EU’s own problems so the British public’s expectations can be reset.Theresa May never made any attempt to talk up the UK’s strengths and put over the EU’s weaknesses, instead she went down the diplomatic route of pleasantries and platitudes which led inevitably to her making all the concessions on the agenda, timeline, costs and liabilities – never mind the trading arrangements. I expect the new British prime minister to be dferent and to expose how the EU is on the horns of many dilemmas that means co-operation with the UK will be in Brussels’ interest.The EU desperately needs the UK’s money as it already faces huge public deficits and is bizarrely planning to increase spending. Those members that are net contributorsdo not wish to pay more than they have to. The proposed £ billion separation bill will come in handy before they adjust to living without the UK’s annual net contribution of £-£bn – but it is not a fixed figure and is open to modication. While the UK will want to operate under the rule of law and honour past commitments, there is little in the £bn that rests on legal agreements, meaning even going to international arbitration is highly risky for the EU.The EU wants and needs our money, end of. It says it will not reopen negotiations on the now dead Withdrawal Treaty. These two positions are not compatible.A recent report by City banking specialist Bob Lyddon exposed how the UK remains on the hook for at least £bn of EU contingent liabilities, possibly rising to £bnBrexit is extended further, were there to be a banking and credit crisis in the eurozone. The possibility of this event coming to pass rises daily. Lyddon identied a black hole in eurozone finances of one trillion and how “zombie” loans and misleading accounting practices keeps the bad debt from being called in. Just last week Deutsche Bank, one of the banks carrying a horrendous £bn book of toxic assets, announced , redundancies globally, with , of those predicted in London. That will be worse than any single loss of jobs due to Brexit in the Cityand betrays the hood of continuing CBI and Bank of England scaremongering. The EU claims it is solving the eurozone debt crisis but the debt total grows and the bad practices continue. The two positions are not compatible and our new prime minister must ensure the contingent liabilities are removed the day we leave the EU, not least because we were never members of the Eurozone anyway.Thanks to the behind-closed-doors horse-trading at the recent council of ministers, we can also see how the EU’s democracy is a sham. Nominations for presidents of the commission, the council, the Parliament and the European Central Bank resembled musical chairs between the favoured elite rather than elections. The obvious answer is to democratise the process but that means going fully towards a federal Europe Union that has no demos – and against the reviving belief that the nation state is beautul and optimal. The two positions are opposite and incompatible. If EU nations want “more Europe” then that’s up to them but it goes against the tide of sympathy in the UK. If the new prime minister declares May’s Withdrawal Treaty as dead – as he should do –the solution of using GATT Article XXIV that would continue trade from Brexit Day forward without tarfs and quotas becomes more attractive than ever. True, it requires the EU to sign off an outline free trade agreementand critics of this approach argue it will refuse. But wait – it has already offered such a deal to Great Britain . Now that the Republic of Ireland has admitted there will be no customs checks at the Irish border, surely the EU’s offer of an FTA could be extended across the whole of the UK  The EU’s past offer and refusal to extend it is not compatible with the Lisbon Treaty that requires co-operation with departing members. The EU would look in the wrong to the eyes of the whole world. If the EU refuses, it is Brussels that is moving towards a hard Brexit. Such a disrespectful and abrasive approach will play into the hands of the new prime minister, Leavers and the Brexit Party while eating away at support for remaining, finishing off any prospect of a second referendum or the need for a general election.Thanks to all these dilemmas, the EU power brokers have fear in their eyes. Last week the normal conventions of sharing out committee chairs in the European Parliament among all political groupings was abandoned with a cordon sanitaire erected to ensure no European eurosceptics were elected as should be expected. Gentleman’s agreements were ungentlemanly torn up. The fisheries committee anointed as president Chris Davies, a British Liberal Democrat who believes all British waters belong to the EU. Its vice-president is Dutchman, Peter van Dalen, who is responsible for ensuring electric pulse fishing continues in the North Sea.Our new prime minister must change the media mood music by airing these EU dilemmas to put them on the back foot – and change the dynamics of the Brexit debate. -Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"adventurer to follow in footsteps of trailblazing nature writer nan shepherd","story":"Nearly eighty years after Nan Shepherd wrote her seminal and sensual exploration of the Cairngorms, a young adventurer will tomorrow begin to retrace her steps, using the same piecemeal provisions the author relied on. Shepherd, a modernist writer and poet who spent the majority of her working le as a teacher, wrote The Living Mountain in , only to keep the manuscript hidden away in a drawer for more than three decades. However, thanks to its publication by Canongate, the poetic, almost metaphysical meditation on her beloved Cairngorms is nowadays regarded as a cult classic.Nearly forty years after her death, Shepherd, a self-professed ldquopeerer into nooks and crannies, is regarded as one of Scotlandrsquos most important women writers - not least because of her foray into a genre traditionally dominated by men - and nowadays has pride of place on one of Royal Bank of Scotlands £ banknotes. For Elise Wortley, the discovery of Shepherdrsquos trailblazing journeys through the Cairngorms came at an opportune time in her le. Last year, the -year-old recreated part of Alexandra David-Neacuteels celebrated trek into India, an endeavour which saw her journey through the Himalayas for a month using no modern equipment. Kicking her heels over how to emulate the feat and shine a light on the neglected legacies of other empowering female adventurers, her mother recommended she read The Living Mountain to find some inspiration. Now, she is steeling herself to follow where Shepherd once travelled, and scale the six highest peaks of the Cairngorms in five days, before spending a further  days ldquojust living in the mountains as Nan would have. The aim, she says, is to raise awareness and celebrate a ldquogroundbreaking woman who never formed part of her lessons at school. In turn, she will raise money for Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, and hopes her adventure will inspire a new generation in the way Shepherd has motivated her. Ms Wortley, from London, told The Scotsman that when she first picked up a copy of The Living Mountain, she was spellbound and ldquotransported into Nanrsquos world. ldquoIt wasnrsquot what I was expecting. Itrsquos like one long poem, and the way she describes elements like water and a mountainrsquos plateau are just beautul, she recalled. ldquoShe was writing at a time when eastern religions were starting to have an influence in western le, and you can sense that otherworldly nature to it.ldquoI hope that by really immersing myself in the Cairngorms the way she did, I can understand what she was writing about a deeper level.True to Shepherdrsquos era, Ms Wortley will forego her smartphone and all other modern day comforts, and instead make do with a wooden backpack containing tweed clothing, war rations, and a canvas tent. It will, she hopes, be a transformative experience. ldquoYou get such an amazing sense of the place reading the book, but itrsquos important I think to be there with no distractions and try and unravel what it was she was feeling when she wrote it, and why she put it in a drawer for  years, she explained. ldquoShersquos someone who was overshadowed by her counterparts at the time, and so Irsquom really excited to go where she did and celebrate her achievements. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"climate activists use 25ft boat to block road in glasgow city centre","story":"Extinction Rebellion Scotlands vessel was placed in Trongate on Monday, covering the intersection of Gallowgate and High Street, by the Merchant City clock tower.The boat carries a message from the group which says Act Now, understood to be a demand for the UK Government to do more to tackle the climate crisis.A message saying \"The future you fear is already here\" is on the other side of the vessel.Scores of campaigners attended the protest, surrounded by a heavy police presence.Elliot Blaauw, , of Inverness, was one of the protesters ready to risk arrest by gluing themselves to the boatnecessary.: Activists plan to unleash summer uprising He said: \"Waters are rising, we are rising too.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”.

Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery.

Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example.

The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike.

I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells.

Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations.

However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10k for northern ireland civil servant offended by portraits of queen and philip peer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland.

Ms McKee was shot dead by a New IRA gunman during rioting in Londonderry in April.As per Lyras swishes, some of the money from the book will go to Paper Trail, which works closely with human rights and victims groups that represent families affected by the conflict.The organisation is registered with the Charity Commission and Companies House, and lists Mr McClenaghan as being on the charity trustee board and being a company director.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle. A number of spaces shall also remain for non-residents.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"witnesses sought masked men enter flat","story":"Police in Derry have launched an appeal for witnesses following an incident when up to eight masked men entered a flat in Moss Park in the city and smashed windows.Sergeant Breen said: \"We received a report around .pm on Thursday, July  that - masked men had broken into the premises smashing windows.\"There was one person in the flat who escaped uninjured but has been left badly shaken.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh “We are appealing for anyone with information who may have witnessed anything in the area to contact police at Strand Road station on  quoting reference number  of   . “Or,someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on    which is % anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.\""},{"url":null,"title":"powys signs off gagging orders payoffs","story":"Powys County Councillor Jeremy Pugh\" Who signs off gagging orders and payoffs Head of Legal and Democratic Services and Monitoring Officer to Powys Council, Cltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlive Pinneylt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"powys signs off gagging orders payoffs","story":"Powys County Councillor Jeremy Pugh\" Who signs off gagging orders and payoffs Head of Legal and Democratic Services and Monitoring Officer to Powys Council, Cltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlive Pinneylt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod wells carnival 2019 hundreds","story":"The best overall float and winner of the Gordon Phillips Cup was Underhill Ridinltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtg Stables with the Pltspan classtruncate-full-screengtony Clubrsquos th Birthday celebrations also this year.

However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aerogels are already used in several engineering applications, including Nasarsquos Mars exploration rovers.Robin Wordsworth, assistant professor of environmental science and engineering at the Hard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , and the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, said: ldquoThis regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global atmospheric modication.ldquoUnlike the previous ideas to make Mars habitable, this is something that can be developed and tested systematically with materials and technology we already have.Laura Kerber, research scientist at Nasarsquos Jet Propulsion Laboratory, added: ldquoMars is the most habitable planet in our Solar System besides Earth. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Hubble Space Telescope image of Mars  --ldquoBut it remains a hostile world for many kinds of le.

Among the start-up activities in the Centre will be classes in woodwork, woodcarving, cooking and baking and a range of arts and crafts.In the longer term it is hoped that the Centre will also be able to offer classes in pottery, gardening and horticulture and knitting and sowing. All the classes will be taught by experienced practitioners who are happy to put their gts at the service of the community.For those interested in outdoor physical exercise the Centre will organise opportunities for groups to walk, swim and cycle. An important part of the work of this new project will be to address the issue of the stigma associated with mental health. To this end the Centre will offer sessions on topics such as depression, anxiety, addiction, grief and low self-esteem. It will also help those who need to talk about themselves and their lives by providing a safe and confidential listening service. All activities at the Portadown Wellness Centre will be free of charge. It is hoped that funding will be provided by both the public and private sectors.Already positive negotiations have taken place with The National Lottery, The Department of Communities, The Southern Trust, Armagh, Banbridge  Craigavon Borough Council and The Housing Executive. Leading local employers have also agreed to support the project.These include Asda Portadown, Tesco Portadown, Sainsbury’s Craigavon and Thompson Aero Seating.The Portadown Wellness Centre will be governed by a caring and experienced board of management.The board members are Norma McConville MBE, Alan McDowell, Philip McParland, Lynsey Bannon, Tesco Portadown, Elaine Livingstone, Asda Portadown, Dwain Tollent, Sainsbury’s Craigavon, Karen Nixon, Thompson Aero Seating.For further information about Portadown Wellness Centre and its activities and plans contact Alan McDowell, Secretary, on Tel:    or email: alanmcdowell@gmail.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
