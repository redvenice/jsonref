Opposite a country club, it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home that Meghan lived in during her youth. However, the inside was fraught with problems and was where Thomas Jr allegedly smoked weed all day, while dad Thomas Sr worked night and day           The Duchess of Sussex, here on her birthday August 4,  lived in multiple modest homes before finding fame with her role in Suits and marrying Prince HarryMeghan lived on the property until she was two years old and it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home she lived in during her youth.It was located opposite a country club - but the inside was fraught with problems, according to acclaimed biographer Andrew Morton, who wrote the book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Thomas Jr smoked weed all day and even her mother would share a joint with a neighbor, while TV lighting director Thomas worked night and day, and wild teen Samantha would be out clubbing.Doria and Thomas had married at the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple on Sunset Blvd, in a \u0027hippie wedding\u0027 in December 1979.They orced four years later and Meghan went to live with her mother in a top-floor apartment on S. Cloverdale Ave, Mid-Wilshire.It was once the garage and loft space for the main front property.This was recently renovated and is currently for rent at $3,950 a month, ten times what her mother would have been paying over 30 years previously.Although Meghan lived in modest homes, she attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten called Little Red Schoolhouse which starts at $18,800 a year for kindergarten and $22,600 year for sixth-grade.  After her parents orced in 1983, Meghan and her mother Doria moved into a top-floor apartment (pictured) in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of LA. The apartment previously served as the garage and loft space of the main front property. The Duchess of Sussex split her time here and at her father\u0027s home until she graduated high school in 1999          Meghan and Doria lived behind this two-bedroom, one bathroom house (pictured) on South Cloverdale Avenue. Their home was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her father worked and where she spent time after schoolThe school was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her Emmy-winning father worked on the set of Married With Children and where she would spend her days after school.Her mother Doria, 62, had a less glamorous location for her line of business, which was still only a stone\u0027s throw away from the school - now called the Hollywood Schoolhouse.She owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea St in Hancock Park for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. As can be seen in our photos, the run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium, which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated.When Meghan moved on to the $15,900-a-year Immaculate Heart High School, which she attended from 1991 to 1999, she lived with her dad on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition.This is where Thomas recently said in an interview that he\u0027d warned his daughter off the controversial religion after catching her lingering outside the building.Her father\u0027s apartment was on the ground floor and had two tiny bedrooms with bars across the windows.She lived there until she was 17. Now the place has been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years.          Meghan\u0027s mother Doria, 62, previously owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea Ave in Hancock Park - just a few blocks away from Meghan\u0027s elementary school for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. The run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium (pictured) which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated          Meghan began splitting her time between her mom\u0027s house and her dad\u0027s Hollywood apartment (pictured) when she was 11 until she left for college in 1999. Thomas Sr was living in a two-bedroom ground floor flat on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition          Thomas Sr\u0027s apartment, pictured above with bars across the window, was a short distance to Meghan\u0027s high school. According to a biography on the duchess, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week,\u0027 however, as she got older, there was friction between the two since she felt she was the one who was mothering her father          Not so shabby: The home has since been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years. Pictured above is the large living space of the Hollywood home   The two-bedroom, two-bath home located in the heart of Hollywood is now listed for rent. Pictured left is a renovated kitchen, while the right shows an upgraded living space with hardwood floors According to Morton\u0027s book, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week.\u0027\u0027It was a decision that would have far-reaching implications for the way she was seen by her new teachers and classmates…The older she became, the more she felt she was the one who was mothering her father. It was a source of friction, especially when she started dating,\u0027 the book states. Meghan also had various part-time jobs and volunteer work including bussing tables and serving food at the Hippie Kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles, a Catholic set up to help the homeless living in the notorious Skid Row.She was an assistant at the Paper Store in Beverly Hills, where she also taught calligraphy, and served frozen yogurt at Humphrey Yogart, in Sherman Oaks.When she left high school to attend Northwestern University in Illinois she met film producer Trevor Engelson in a bar on one of her visits back home in LA.Royal reporter claims journalists are being kept at a...Meghan Markle \u0027is at her wits\u0027 end over her father\u0027s public...Share this article \u0027When Meghan first met him on that night out in West Hollywood, she liked what she saw and was attracted to his passion, drive, and ambition.

She attended Immaculate Heart High School (pictured) on Franklin Ave in Los Angeles from the age of 11 up to 18. Tuition is now $15,900 a year          She attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten school called Little Red Schoolhouse, pictured, which cost $18,800 a year for kindergarten. It is now called Hollywood Schoolhouse          This is where Meghan and her first husband Trevor Engleson lived - behind Whisky A Go-Go, a notorious club on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood on Hilldale Ave during their marriage until they split in 2013. Engelson reportedly still lives there todayYet it was her childhood that defined Meghan, the aspiring actress and now adored royal. \u0027While her childhood experiences were the crucible that set her on the path to activism,\u0027 says Morton.\u0027Her mother believes that she was hardwired from birth to try to make the world a better and more equal place. In short, she had a moral compass.\u0027Despite wanting to be a Hollywood star, it was her faith that was equally important and the central pillar for Meghan and Doria. So much so, that we can disclose she was once a youth minister for the Agape International Spiritual Center, which her mum is still a member today, along with TV host Oprah Winfrey.Sharon Fox, now an executive producer at California Motion Picture Company, was also a member and told her Facebook followers about bumping into the duchess and her husband Prince Harry in Dublin earlier this month.\u0027It was such a nice surprise to bump into them when I went to Dublin to view the Book of Kells. Meghan was very sweet and I had a short chat with her during her stop on the walk about regarding our church, the Agape International Spiritual Center, and our mutual minister, Reverend Michael Bernard Beckwith... Meghan was a youth minister at my church, Agape, in LA years ago when I used to volunteer with the babies and toddlers on Church Sunday at Agape… I can not recall if I ever met her back then but it is clear she radiates that Agape spirit where ever she goes.\u0027 The Chuckle Brothers are airport assistants in ChuckleVisionDuchess of Sussex leaves Charlie van Straubenzee\u0027s weddingSamantha Eastwood\u0027s sister and her ex-fiance bring flowers to houseSaudi Arabia expels Canadian ambassador and freezes all tradeBen Stokes fights with men after allegedly mocking \u0027camp behaviour\u0027Travellers leave rubbish on Cobham green after eviction in MayChuckle Brothers host hilarious new show from their own living roomMen play football on M6 as motorway is closed after a crashDriver unexpectedly meets low-flying helicopter on misty roadFootage shows ants build incredible bridge to raid wasps nestEngland cricketer Ben Stokes arrives at court to face trialMeghan celebrates 37th birthday at wedding of Harry\u0027s best friendHer new digs: Meghan\u0027s childhood homes are a far cry from her new home in Kensington Palace (pictured)           Meghan and Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage, opposite Princess Diana\u0027s former home The Chuckle Brothers are airport assistants in ChuckleVisionDuchess of Sussex leaves Charlie van Straubenzee\u0027s weddingSamantha Eastwood\u0027s sister and her ex-fiance bring flowers to houseSaudi Arabia expels Canadian ambassador and freezes all tradeBen Stokes fights with men after allegedly mocking \u0027camp behaviour\u0027Travellers leave rubbish on Cobham green after eviction in MayChuckle Brothers host hilarious new show from their own living roomMen play football on M6 as motorway is closed after a crashDriver unexpectedly meets low-flying helicopter on misty roadFootage shows ants build incredible bridge to raid wasps nestEngland cricketer Ben Stokes arrives at court to face trialMeghan celebrates 37th birthday at wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/15/4ED24E5900000578-6026421-image-a-24_1533392403111.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan spotted friends wedding","story":"    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex held hands in a public display of affection following the wedding ceremony in Frensham earlier today          The Duchess of Sussex was seen enjoying a joke outside the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Frensham, before the wedding          Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, walk out of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, after the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee          The happy couple looked delighted as they made their way out of the church on three wheels          Meghan\u0027s 37th birthday celebrations today were vastly different to her last.

It is unfortunate to see dog meat consumption being legal in this nation. The WDA believes a legal ban on eating dog meat would allow the UK to continue to have a global leading role in the field of animal protection, especially after UK leaves the EU.\u0027Local citizens in the Western countries barely eat dog meat, but the WDA worries that dog meat consumption may be spread to UK with immigration. In the US, people who eat dog meat are mainly immigrants from Asia.\u0027           Last night Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said a ban on eating dogs is absolutely rightDowning Street said it will be examining the decision made by US Congress but did not clarify if it would support a ban.Theresa May\u0027s official spokesman told a Westminster media briefing: \u0027The commercial trade in dog meat in the UK is illegal, but we will look closely at the decision taken in the US.\u0027Britain is a nation of animal lovers and we continue to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. We wish to maintain that.\u0027  Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, who owns a prize-winning cockapoo called Noodle, has urged the Prime Minister to tackle the issue. Last night he dubbed a full ban \u0027absolutely right\u0027,The Sun reported.Sir Alan said: \u0027There is no need in the modern world for this disgusting habit. We should nip it in the bud now to make sure the practice never takes off here. A civilised country is decent to animals, so let\u0027s be fully decent here.\u0027             Campaigners are calling on Theresa May to ban the eating of dogs in BritainChairman of the All-party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group Lisa Cameron MP is one of those supporting the ban on dog meat consumption.She said: \u0027We are urging the Government to bring in a ban. We are concerned by the World Dog Alliances\u0027 report about dog food consumption in the UK.\u0027We want to send out a strong message that people don\u0027t want to see it here in the UK.\u0027The RSPCA has dismissed the idea that dog meat consumption is on the rise as its says existing legislation in the Animal Welfare Act 2006 prevents the widespread practice of it.   In a statement, the RSPCA, said: \u0027It is illegal to sell dog meat to the public in the UK. There are also no abattoirs that have a licence to kill dogs and it would be against slaughter and animal welfare legislation too. So, while dog meat eating is not specifically banned here these laws mean that there is effectively a ban on the practice.\u0027\u0027The RSPCA has no evidence that dog meat eating is on the rise in the UK, nor have we ever received any reports on this issue. While we do not believe it happens here, we continue to monitor the situation.\u0027 An estimated 30 million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia - with most stolen off the street. Dog meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.US Congress made its decision to ban the import, trade and consumption of dog meat after concerns that immigration from the Far East had seen it increase.The WDA has also been urging Asian countries to ban dog meat consumption.  Theresa May faces urgent calls to ban the eating of dogs in Britain after campaigners warn it is on the rise"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/10/4EDF9C9400000578-6030859-image-m-17_1533549365608.jpg","title":"Nanny claims doctor couple treated like servant flying Egypt Britain","story":"Asmaa Hemdan (pictured today arriving at an employment tribunal in Watford) claims she was treated like a servant by her former employers who brought her to the UK in 2011A nanny brought to Britain to work for a doctor couple has detailed the alleged horrific treatment carried out by the pair, claiming she was called a \u0027dog\u0027, locked in a room for days and had her passport taken away.Asmaa Hemdan was paid just £400 in five months, or less than 50p an hour, by gynaecology specialist Dr Safaa Ismail and consultant neurosurgeon Hussien Al-Maghraby, an employment tribunal was told today.Miss Hemdan claims Dr Safaa asked her to sell her kidney and threatened to have her killed.The 37-year-old said she was treated like a servant by the couple, who lived in a three-storey house in Muswell Hill, north London, where homes are worth an average of nearly £800,000.Miss Hemdan was flown from Egypt to work for the pair, who are also from Egypt, in May of 2011 as a nanny to their then-four-year-old son.Miss Hemdan said she was fed leftovers and when she complained, was locked in a bedroom for two days with no food and had to drink from a tap in the bathroom.She also claimed they took her passport from her and made veiled threats to sell her.Watford Employment Tribunal was told Miss Hemdan, who has 12 siblings in Egypt and worked to support her family, was forced to hand over her bank card. The tribunal was told she was called \u0027ignorant\u0027, a \u0027dog\u0027 and \u0027disgusting\u0027 and was banned from her room and forced to sleep on the sofa if she displeased the couple.She said that Dr Safaa told her brother in Egypt they could always pay someone to kill her.Miss Hemda claims she eventually fled five months into the job when she was left alone at the couple\u0027s house.  Gynaecology specialist Dr Safaa Ismail (left) and her husband consultant neurosurgeon Hussien Al-Maghraby (right) are alleged to have paid Miss Hemdan only £400 in five months of work after hiring her to look after their four-year-old son in 2011In addition to free board at the couple\u0027s home, she was supposed to be paid £200 per month for working eight hours per day, six days per week. Miss Hemdan claims the payments stopped after two months, earning only £400. This means she was paid less than 50p an hour for five months of work, based on a 45-hour work week.  At one point in August when she complained about the alleged conditions, Dr Safaa became \u0027furious\u0027, it is claimed.In her witness statement, Miss Hemdan said: \u0027Dr Safaa became furious and began to shout at Miss Hemdan, as she did so pushing her up the stairs.\u0027Miss Hemdan was then locked in one of the bedrooms.\u0027Miss Hemdan was told that she could come out when she apologised.\u0027She was instructed to remain in her room and did so for two days before being allowed out of the room.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal: \u0027I was in my room for two days and no one brought me any food or water.\u0027I was too frightened to leave the room as I was scared of Dr Safaa. I was able to drink water from the sink in the bathroom.\u0027She added: \u0027I was treated as a servant and often told that I was a servant.\u0027The nanny alleged to the tribunal Dr Safaa was responsible for much of the treatment.She once told Miss Hemdan \u0027that she had girls working for her before and that if they didn\u0027t like things then she sold them on\u0027, it is alleged.          Miss Hemdan said she was fed leftovers and when she complained, was locked in a bedroom  with no food and had to drink from a tap in the bathroom. She also claimed they took her passport from her and made veiled threats to sell her.

I did not know what to say.\u0027Dr Safaa waited a moment and then asked me what did I think about that? I answered that if someone would do it, it would be a human and good thing to do.\u0027Dr Safaa replied: \u0027\u0027Are you willing?\u0027\u0027. I said no, that I was talking in general, not about my own kidney.\u0027Dr Safaa said that she could get me £25,000 if I agreed to give \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 my kidney.\u0027I believe that when she said \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 she meant her and the bank manager.\u0027I said no, I could not possibly do this.

After studying law in Bogota, he worked for the Washington-based Inter American Development Bank, which finances development projects across Latin America.Because of his work here, Iván started to mingle in similar circles as Alvaro Uribe, the President of Colombia from 2002 to 2010, who soon became his mentor and after the President began the center-right Democratic Center Party in 2013, Duque returned to run as Senator.          Iván Duque was mentored by Alvaro Uribe,the President of Colombia from 2002 to 2010Duque’s focus soon became the peace deal struck by former President Juan Manuel Santos between the state and the FARC and while it won international praise, it proved to be isive in Colombia. TIME explained that for 50 years, around 220,000 people had been killed, millions displaced and land covered in land mines.After the peace deal, the FARC leaders walked free and as many believed, escaped justice for the crimes that they had committed. However, during Santos’ referendum, Duque campaigned against it and said: ‘My whole life, I’m a person who believes in peace, but I believe that the only way to ensure peace in any society is with the rule of law.’This opposition catapulted Duque into presidential candidacy in December 2017 and now, as President, he will need to ensure that the deal pleases the signatories, the Colombians and the rest of the world. What is clear is that Iván wants stronger sentences for FARC leaders and amnesty to be scrapped for crimes linked to the drug trade.In addition to this, Duque is for reincorporating the FARC into civilian life and said that Santos made the mistake of ‘iding Colombians between friends and enemies of peace. For me, there are no enemies, and we all want peace.’Duque is married to María Juliana Ruiz and the couple have three children Luciana, Matías and Eloísa.          Colombian president Ivan Duque and his vice-presidential running-mate Marta Lucia Ramirez2018 Columbian presidential electionWhen Iván Duque was elected as the next President of Colombia in June 2018, he told his supporters that ‘The peace we all dream of demands corrections. So that victims are the true center of the process and so that there is justice, reparations and no repetition.’Petro also drew in 8 million votes, which marked the biggest ballot box success for a leftist presidential contender in a country where those on the left have been stigmatised over fears of connections to guerrilla causes.Duque continued: ‘This is the opportunity that we have been waiting for - to turn the page on the politics of polarization, insults and venom.’ Speaking to TIME days after he was elected, Duque also suggested that he wants to move past left and right and into an era of neoliberalism.          Iván Duque will attempt to reform controversial peace deal put in place by President Santos‘I’ve always considered myself an extreme centrist. We need to have the right balance between development and environmental protection. The right balance between entrepreneurship and worker rights.‘The right balance between free markets and the ability to fix market flaws … It’s a matter of putting things in the right balance.’ In addition to fighting corruption and rising unemployment, Duque will attempt to minimise Coca production, especially after Colombia has received over $10 billion in US aid since 2000 to fight drug trafficking.After his election, he also revealed that he was open to aerial fumigation with planes to reverse the surge in Coca production. ‘At this time we have to look at all options, and they must be the ones that guarantee the most precision, the most effectiveness and that minimize any damage to third parties.’When will President Iván Duque take office?Outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos banned aerial spraying after a constitutional court ruling that found health and environmental risks. Iván Duque Márquez will take office on Tuesday, August 7, 2018 and will meet Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, August 9.Supergirl movie in the works by Warner Bros and DCAzealia Banks calls Beyonce a \u0026#8216regular b***h\u0026#8217 who stole her choreographyMinecraft film delayed as director and writer are replacedBachelorette finale spoilers: Becca\u0027s family have concerns over Garrett in tonight\u0027s episodeDance Boss: All you need to know about Seven\u0027s new showManiac trailer: See Emma Stone and Jonah Hill in Netflix\u0027s new seriesWho is Alex Jones?

Architecture critic Edwin Heathcote said there is nothing more \u0027British\u0027 than the seaside shelter in an essay written to accompany the photographs. (Pictured, a brightly coloured structure in Paignton, Devon)          The arrival of seaside shelters coincided with the boom of beach holidays in the Victorian-era as Brits took advantage of the developing railway networks to flock to the beach. (Pictured, a seating area on Bangor pier in Gwynedd, Wales)          This well known shelter, in Margate, Kent, has acquired protected status - and the poet TS Eliot wrote about it in his 1922 work The Waste Land          Some British seaside shelters even come with their own clock towers. The huts were still springing up in Art Deco style in the 1930s. (Pictured, a structure near the sea at Frinton-on-Sea in Essex)He said: \u0027There is nothing, quite possibly, more British than the seaside shelter - the sense it embodies of a struggle against the elements, the loneliness of a small structure outlined against the vast horizon of the sea on a rainy day and the optimism of a day out at the seaside despite the weather.\u0027These small, intimate, curious works of micro-architecture are simultaneously reminders of a very particular world view, nostalgia pods and wonderfully public places, perhaps the last architecture owned by us and open to all at any time of the day or the year.\u0027 The building of seaside shelters coincided with the boom of beach holidays in the Victorian-era as Brits took advantage of the developing railway networks to flock to the seaside.

(Pictured, a stunning blue and white hut on the Eastbourne coast)          This simple shelter in Llandudno in Conwy County Borough, Wales sits seamlessly against the backdrop of the coast, illustrating how varied the designs of these huts are          The photographer also captured this intricate yellow, white and black shelter which stands out with its lace-like trim against the coast in Southsea, Hampshire \u0027My aim was not to catalogue all of them, more to pick out a good selection which captures the different styles and eras.\u0027A lot of the shelters are quite rundown and ramshackle but they still have charm and character, and a beauty in them.\u0027In many cases there is no record of when they were built or who built them but they are all unique.\u0027They are relics of the former glories of these towns, many of which are quite rundown.\u0027If this book encourages councils to preserve them, then that can only be a good thing.\u0027           This Art Deco shelter in Hastings, East Sussex features gold and black tiles set against a stark white structure.

Only Mr Lyon, the plane\u0027s rear gunner, survived.             Mr Dale saw the plane, which had suffered engine failure, headed for the ground. After hearing the Wellington bomber plough into the ground, Mr Dale ran what felt like \u0027a million miles\u0027 to get to the wreck, clearing fences in a beeline towards the field where Mr Lyon, then 23, told him to flee (Stock image: Vickers Wellington bomber, 1941)After hearing the plane plough into the ground, Mr Dale ran what felt like \u0027a million miles\u0027 to get to the wreck, clearing fences in a beeline towards the field.When he arrived, Mr Dale saw the 23-year-old Mr Lyon trapped in the burning aircraft and engulfed in flames.The teenager grabbed the airman with both arms and heaved him to safety.The sergeant shouted to Mr Dale to flee from the plane, knowing that the flames were about to ignite the fuel tank.Moments later, as the pair ran from the wreckage, it exploded.They then stood together in a ditch and smoked cigarettes while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.Mr Lyon was missing a boot and trouser leg and had severe burns to his leg and face.          Six weeks later he returned to the village to thank Mr Dale for saving his life but the teenager was working at the time and never had the chance to see him, leaving it up to Mr Lyon\u0027s children decades later (Pictured at St Peter\u0027s Church in Little Rissington)Six weeks later he returned to the village to thank Mr Dale for saving his life - but the teenager was working at the time and never had the chance to see him, leaving it up to Mr Lyon\u0027s children decades later.Mr Dale, who was delighted to meet the family, shrugged off the notion of his own heroism.He said: \u0027It\u0027s just a thing that happened that morning - but I will never forget the sound of that thing when it hit the ground.\u0027I thought to myself many times: I wonder if he made it to the end of the war. And I always hoped he did. He was a real \u0027go and get them\u0027 type of character.\u0027Mr Lyon\u0027s children were also, during their time with Mr Dale, able to visit St Peter\u0027s Church in Little Rissington, where two of Mr Lyon\u0027s fellow airmen were buried.They laid wreaths on the graves and the experience helped make real the significance of Mr Dale\u0027s heroic actions.Marion said: \u0027Going to the church had a big impact, especially when Mr Dale pointed out that that is where my father would have been buried.\u0027          Mr Dale took Doc\u0027s children to the church where two of his fellow airmen were buried.

This photograph was taken in 1970. A sign outside a storefront advertises Sammy\u0027s Bowery Follies, a e bar with cabaret-style live entertainment that catered to the down-and-out. Its owner Sammy Fuchs passed away in 1969 and the bar closed a year later. Today a Whole Foods and other restaurants are in this location          It\u0027s tough work, but someone\u0027s got to do it: Maisel took this photograph of a man asleep in a cart full of soft drink cans on the Lower East Side          Award-winning photographer Jay Maisel has captured thousands of images showcasing the transformation of New York through the decades. The 87-year-old is pictured in his home studio in BrooklynIt was on Bowery in 1966, an area in the pits of its decline that Maisel bought a six-story, 72-room, former Germania Bank building at 190 Bowery and made it his home for next 49 years - until the rising cost of running it, day to day, prompted him to sell. The building was - and remains - iconic in the area and Maisel rented out his top floors to other artists including Roy Lichtenstein, the master of pop art, and abstract expressionist Adolph Gottlieb. He fended off offers to buy from developers and rock stars. Mick Jagger once approached him through a representative with an offer to buy the 35,000sq-ft space. Maisel wasn\u0027t interested. In this time, gentrification took ahold around him. In the 1990s and 2000s, the homeless population decreased, the streets were cleaned up. Dozens of independent bars and mom and pop stores could no longer afford their skyrocketing rent. Mars bar and CBGB shut their doors too, to much protest.   Perhaps the most glaring example of the area\u0027s gentrification is that in 2015 Maisel sold the bank building he\u0027d bought for $102,000 in 1966 (the equivalent of $776,094.07 in today\u0027s money), for $55million. Some called it the \u0027greatest real estate coup of all time\u0027. Maisel was just sorry to leave. He told DailyMail.com: ‘When I first moved there it wasn’t super dangerous or anything, but it was super depressing.  \u0027Guys on your sidewalk, guys on your steps, you had to be judicious on who you threw off your steps and who you didn’t. Because some of the guys you knew you’d have big trouble if you tried to get rid of them.’ ‘I always treated everyone really nice, I never tried to demean anyone or treat them in any way less than a human. But there was times where you had to be firm with them.’           There may be snow on the ground but this man, whose tattoos show a crudely drawn skull and crossbones along with the words Hell\u0027s Angel across his back, didn\u0027t wear a coat - or a shirt. A passer-by is bundled up in a coat and hat          Crime and grime: ‘When I first moved there it wasn’t super dangerous or anything, but it was super depressing. Guys on your sidewalk, guys on your steps, you had to be judicious on who you threw off your steps and who you didn’t.’ Pictured is a photograph of a man with his trousers down near a trash bin just outside a bar on the corner of Bowery and East 4th Streets. The bar remains open today          Plus, the access his building provided at 190 Bowery to shoot street scenes from his windows or rooftop went unmatched. Pictured above is a photo he took of the Resolvent Building and a clothes line in Bowery  Maisel spends most of his days sorting through the thousands of slides he has of images he captured during his career in an effort to digitize and catalogue them. Pictured above is an image he snapped while in the LES showing men hanging out on their fire escapes          Maisel often took advantage of the incredible views from inside his massive 72-room residence at 190 Bowery. In 1966 he purchased the iconic former Germania Bank building at the corner of Bowery and Spring Streets for $102,000, which is the   the equivalent of $776,094.07 today. The image above is one Maisel captured from the roof of his home showing the Twin Towers Now, the acclaimed photographer, who shot several early Sports Illustrated Swimsuit magazine covers, has settled into his Brooklyn townhouse in quiet Cobble Hill. Speaking to DailyMail.com from inside his home studio, where the walls are full of his favorite eye-catching images (including a large photo showing the side profile of Lady Day), the father-of-one explained in between sips of cold bottled water just how much his old neighborhood has transformed.Maisel, was born in Brooklyn and studied graphic design and painting at Manhattan’s Cooper Union and Yale University, became a photographer in 1954 when he first started to capture images of everything and everyone.He could often be found at jazz clubs, listening to legends like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis perform. But he would also capture what are now iconic images of those artists. In fact, one of the most notable images of Davis is one that Maisel captured – it’s the cover photo of Davis’ 1959 Kind of Blue album.           Speaking to DailyMail.com from inside his spacious home studio, where the walls are full of his favorite eye-catching images (including a large photo showing the side profile of Lady Day pictured above his right shoulder), the father-of-one explained in between sips of cold bottled water just how much his old neighborhood has transformed          He started taking his camera and shot images of everything and everyone around him. Pictured above is a photo he captured showing two men sleeping on a mattress on a rooftop - an image he captured from his own rooftop at 190 Bowery  Maisel even took his camera with him on amusement rides, capturing moments like the one pictured above left showing a couple kissing while riding a Ferris Wheel in one of the Lower Manhattan neighborhoods decades ago. His prolific photo collection truly showcases the drastic changes Manhattan has experienced over the decades with mom and pop businesses shuttering due to high rents and luxury sky rise apartments popping up in their place, specifically in the LES and Bowery which are now hipster havens          Early on in his career, Maisel could often be found at jazz clubs in the Big Apple, listening to legends like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis perform. But he would also capture what are now iconic images of those same artists. In fact, one of the most notable images of Davis is one that Maisel captured – it’s the cover photo of Davis’ 1959 Kind of Blue album. Pictured above is an image Maisel took of workers removing damaged pieces from a nearby building after a fire took place          Maisel noted that he was ‘very fortunate’ during the beginning stages of his career because people would often purchase the images straight out of his portfolio.  Pictured above is an image Maisel captured showing the entrance to one of the city\u0027s bridges near Chinatown, which is drastically different today          Maisel’s building easily became an icon of the community as he once rented out the top floors to other artists like Adolph and Roy Lichtenstein. He repeatedly had to turn down offers from people and developers desiring to buy it, including Mick Jagger who approached Maisel through a representative at one point with an offer for the 35,000-square-foot space. The views from the various windows inside the building always seemed to offer a peak into the variety of his neighbor\u0027s activities, such as the image he captured above showing a man napping while the people above him in a different space have a nude photo shoot‘I was interested in a lot of different things. I used to shoot a lot of dance, I shot a lot of jazz, I just went out and shot,’ Maisel said of his career early on.‘You know it was easier to do then because there were no big hoops you had to jump through to get permission to shoot. You didn’t have to deal with publicists reviewing your work. And basically I didn’t do it for anybody, I did it for myself.‘Later on I got assignments to shoot and that was a different kind of game all together. But mostly I liked shooting for myself.’Maisel noted that he was ‘very fortunate’ during the beginning stages of his career because people would often purchase the images straight out of his portfolio. ‘I started doing a lot of stock photography and for me stock photography meant do whatever you want, and maybe you will sell it,’ he added.‘But if you don’t sell it at least you did what you wanted to. So a lot of stock photographers would shoot in order to sell that kind of picture, but I never thought that was much fun.’By the mid-1960s, he had earned enough money working in the industry as a stock image photographer that he decided to make the big purchase on the former bank building, after nearly everyone he asked advised him against it.‘I completely and irrevocably was told by everyone this is something you shouldn’t do,’ he quipped.‘People would say “This is the dumbest thing you’ve ever done. Are you out of your mind? How are you going to carry this man?”. The building was not a good look on the outside, but I saw the space inside and was crazy. I loved it.’           He explained: ‘I started doing a lot of stock photography and for me stock photography meant do whatever you want, and maybe you will sell it.\u0027 The image above Maisel captured shows a man wearing a suit and hat while reading a newspaper outside of a bright red building in the Lower East Side. The man\u0027s style is something few would sport today in the hipster neighborhood          Maisel truly captured photos of anything and everything around the city, including the image above of two men carrying a huge piece of material off a truck in the Bowery neighborhood. He said: ‘But if you don’t sell it at least you did what you wanted to. So a lot of stock photographers would shoot in order to sell that kind of picture, but I never thought that was much fun.\u0027  By the mid-1960s, Maisel had earned enough money working in the industry as a stock image photographer that he decided to make the big purchase on the former bank building, after nearly everyone he asked advised him against it. Pictured above is an image he captured while living in the area of a man hanging out of a window right, a woman peers from her window          He said that once he saw the space inside 190 Bowery he loved it. Pictured above is an image of a steel worker Maisel captured from the rooftop of his building, which provided him 360 degree views of Lower Manhattan          Day in and day out he would capture images from the rooftop or the various window views showcasing the neighborhood from his building at 190 Bowery. Pictured above is one photo he snapped from his rooftop of a fire burning nearby           Pictured above are two girls riding the Ferris Wheel during a small fair in the city that Maisel captured. He also recounted how he would constantly receive offers from people and companies seeking to buy the building from him. ‘I have a whole file of people who wanted to buy the bank. I never had a broker on that deal. But people would come to me all the time,’ he said.          The octogenarian added: ‘And I remember even as I lived there, you couldn’t walk down Spring Street on a weekend without hearing nine different languages from tourists that come there. By now it’s all gentrified and it’s a lot less interesting. You know it’s like an outdoor mall.’ Pictured above is a young girl hanging out of a car window in Chinatown - which in recent years has been plagued by even more gentrification like Maisel mentioned          Pictured above is an image showing the exterior of Maisel\u0027s former home at 190 Bowery. The graffiti covering the building led many to believe the building was vacant when in fact it wasn\u0027t. Three years after selling, it still remains covered in graffiti (pictured above in 2018) Day in and day out he would capture images from the rooftop or the various window views showcasing the neighborhood from his building at 190 Bowery.His prolific photo collection showcases the drastic changes Manhattan has experienced over the decades with mom and pop businesses shuttering due to high rents and luxury sky rise apartments popping up in their place, specifically in the LES.‘The transition was very subtle and very slow. I never thought the Bowery would get to be where it is now, in my lifetime,’ he shared.‘I figured I’m going to die here, it will be fine because this is the best building anyone could possibly ever have.‘But then it got better, and retail stores moved into the neighborhood, Armani opened on Broadway. This place opened and another place opened and then suddenly the whole thing snowballed.‘By now it’s all gentrified and it’s a lot less interesting. You know it’s like an outdoor mall.’The octogenarian added: ‘And I remember even as I lived there, you couldn’t walk down Spring Street on a weekend without hearing nine different languages from tourists that come there.’Maisel also recounted how he would constantly receive offers from people and companies seeking to buy the building from him.‘I have a whole file of people who wanted to buy the bank. I never had a broker on that deal. But people would come to me all the time,’ he said.‘We had a call one time where a representative for Mick Jagger said that he wanted to buy the bank, and we said it’s not for sale. “You don’t understand it’s Mick Jagger!” and I said, “You don’t understand it’s not for sale.”’In 1995, Maisel decided to quit shooting commercial photographs and get back to his roots of capturing images for himself. But that move caused his income to decline and after a while he ran out of money.‘When I bought the building, it cost $200 a month to fill the oil tank. When I sold the building, that cost jumped to $8,000 a month to fill the tank,’ he noted.‘I didn’t want to sell the building. I didn’t want to sell it when I sold it. But at that point it became obvious that it made sense and I was running out of options and money. But selling it, the price was good.’The $55million sale of the graffiti covered building is still one of the most notable real estate deals to occur in the Big Apple. In making history across the bridge in Brooklyn, Maisel’s subsequent $15million purchase of a town home in Cobble Hill also made headlines as one of the most expensive purchases in the borough’s history.‘I miss Manhattan, I love Manhattan. As soon as I get over the bridge I feel like its home. This is like the suburbs to me,’ he said of Brooklyn.‘There’s always this incredible energy in Manhattan, it doesn’t exist here that much.’           The famed photography captured this sweet image of a young girl playing near water from a fire hydrant somewhere in Lower Manhattan not far from his bank building. Of people wanting to buy 190 Bowery from him, Maisel said: ‘We had a call one time where a representative for Mick Jagger said that he wanted to buy the bank, and we said it’s not for sale. “You don’t understand it’s Mick Jagger!” and I said, “You don’t understand it’s not for sale.”’          While living in the bank building, he captured the above image showing a man with his head in between large cement blocks that look fresh. Of the notable building and neighborhood he called home for decades, Maisel said:‘I figured I’m going to die here, it will be fine because this is the best building anyone could possibly ever have. But then it got better, and retail stores moved into the neighborhood, Armani opened on Broadway. This place opened and another place opened and then suddenly the whole thing snowballed.\u0027          Maisel shot images no matter what the weather was outside in the Big Apple, including snow storms like the photo above showing a man dressed up while walking in the snow in the neighborhood          Of the city\u0027s transformation, he said: ‘The transition was very subtle and very slow. I never thought the Bowery would get to be where it is now, in my lifetime.\u0027 Pictured above is a man walking during a snowstorm in one of the Lower Manhattan neighborhoods           He captured the photo above of men chatting with each other on a corner in the LES. Of living in Brooklyn now, he shared: ‘I miss Manhattan, I love Manhattan. As soon as I get over the bridge I feel like its home. This is like the suburbs to me.\u0027           He added: ‘There’s always this incredible energy in Manhattan, it doesn’t exist here that much.\u0027 Pictured above are men playing a game inside one of the parks along Bowery Street in the 1970s or 80s that Maisel captured          He added, ‘I always treated everyone really nice, I never tried to demean anyone or treat them in anyway less than a human. But there was times where you had to be firm with them.’ Pictured above is martial arts class in an image captured by Maisel in Chinatown at a park          Pictured above is an image he captured of two men working on a rooftop in his Bowery neighborhood. He said: ‘When I bought the building, it cost $200 a month to fill the oil tank. When I sold the building, that cost jumped to $8,000 a month to fill the tank,’ he noted.          Maisel had no plans of selling his home, but as time went on the expenses to operate the 72-room space skyrocketed. So in 2015, he gave up his 360 degree rooftop view of Manhattan - which provided amazing views during fireworks shows like the one above          He also captured the image above showing snow on roof tops around his building at 190 Bowery. In 1995, Maisel decided to quit shooting commercial photographs and get back to his roots of capturing images for himself. But that move caused his income to decline and after a while he ran out of money          Concrete jungle where dreams are made: Or even better views could be seen on the roof top at 190 Bowery when storms rolled over the city like the one above. Maisel said: ‘I didn’t want to sell the building. I didn’t want to sell it when I sold it. But at that point it became obvious that it made sense and I was running out of options and money.

I pay £63,000 a year in business rates and what do I have to show for it? When I call the police, they don’t care.’Surrey Police said officers had attended the site and were investigating a series of reported thefts. In a statement, they added: ‘Most unauthorised encampments are dealt with appropriately as a civil law matter between the trespassers and the landowner.‘Legislation requires us to balance the impact of the camp with the rights of the inidual.’Mrs Mitchell, who sits on Elmbridge Borough Council, says travellers had been making unauthorised visits to Cobham for most of her time in the village. But until recently the number of caravans had been small, the arrivals infrequent and the police had swiftly moved them on.‘In the old days it was OK,’ she said. ‘The last two or three years have been awful. The response I have been having from members of the public on emails and phone calls, well, I have never in 35 years known this level of anger. They are asking why they are paying the police because they are useless. There is talk of withholding the policing precept from council tax.‘Most people in Cobham are Remain voters but now some are saying what we need is a Donald Trump in this country. They would not have said that a year ago.’While many other affluent towns report similar problems, in Cobham the past 12 months has seen an almost constant battle between travellers and locals. Last summer a large group of travellers arrived on a field known as Leg O’Mutton.‘There were maybe about 60 vans on there and the travellers rode quad bikes over the football pitches,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘They destroyed the goal posts and broke all the glass in the neighbouring community garden and stole equipment and money from the shed.’ The edge of the area was used as a lavatory and an old van was left behind on the site, with the council facing a clean-up bill of several thousand pounds.Earlier this year, travellers invaded Sainsbury’s car park. There were incidents of shoplifting, one customer was bitten by a traveller’s dog, the supermarket’s cafe was closed for the duration and there was a major impact on sales. Sainsbury’s has since erected a height barrier to prevent caravans entering the car park.          Officers were photographed apparently clearing human waste from tennis courts‘Sainsbury’s are in a better position than ourselves because they are private landowners and can get bailiffs in far quicker than we can for public land,’ Mrs Mitchell said. She says travellers send in others to break down the gates so when they move in they can claim the site was already open.‘Unless we pay security guards 247, which we can’t afford, there is very little we can do to stop them,’ she said. ‘Most of the incursions are happening next to people who are not living in the large, expensive houses. They are affecting the ordinary population, stopping mothers with small children who want to use a safe play area.’During the late May bank holiday, travellers took over the car park at Painshill, an award-winning garden. It had to be closed during one of the most lucrative weekends of the year. When bailiffs evicted them, the travellers simply broke into a council-owned field next door.In June they arrived on Cobham Recreation Field. After they were evicted, the children’s play area had to be closed and specialist cleaners hired. It had just reopened when they returned last week.A few days ago, the council evicted French travellers who had camped in a field of cherry trees planted as a war memorial.Last Tuesday the latest travellers were issued with a notice to leave by Elmbridge Council. On Friday, Guildford magistrates took eight minutes to grant the local authority’s application to have 32 caravans and 35 other vehicles evicted from Cobham Recreation Field.None of the travellers attended court but their leader, Martin Casey, said: ‘Magistrates should do a bit more thinking about where we are going to go, not just signing everything the council tell them to. We’ve nowhere to go, we leave this park and now we have to look for another park in the next town.‘They are pushing us on like cattle all over the place.’That they have left – for now – will come as some relief to residents. But how long the peace will last over a long, hot summer remains to be seen. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/09/4EDED57A00000578-0-image-m-43_1533544846065.jpg","title":"Language phrasebook obsolete according British Council","story":"    More than 60 per cent of 16 to 34-year-olds said they had used their smartphone apps to help boost their understanding of the local language while abroad – but only 39 per cent opted for a phrasebook (file photo)It also found that for many boozy Britons the most important phrase to know is \u0027Dos cervezas, por favor\u0027, with more than one in four UK adults saying they learnt how to ask for two beers, or other drinks, in the local language.\u0027Please\u0027 and \u0027Thank you\u0027 the most common words learned by holidaymakers, followed by Hello\u0027 and \u0027Goodbye\u0027 at 69 per cent.But there are also signs that many Britons are simply learning how to express their lack of foreign language skills, with more than one in four  teaching themselves to say \u0027Do you speak English?\u0027 and 16 per saying they learnt to say: \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t speak the language.\u0027As temperatures in Europe soar to 46C, Met Office...Share this articleJust over a fifth said they did not learn any words or phrases, despite three in four  agreeing that it is important to learn a few phrases.Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: \u0027It\u0027s fantastic that so many of us are ready to give foreign languages a go to make the most of our holidays, and smartphone technology can be a great first step in getting directions and basic information.\u0027However, this technology has its limits and can\u0027t replicate the linguistic and cultural nuances of conversation.

Opposite a country club, it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home that Meghan lived in during her youth. However, the inside was fraught with problems and was where Thomas Jr allegedly smoked weed all day, while dad Thomas Sr worked night and day           The Duchess of Sussex, here on her birthday August 4,  lived in multiple modest homes before finding fame with her role in Suits and marrying Prince HarryMeghan lived on the property until she was two years old and it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home she lived in during her youth.It was located opposite a country club - but the inside was fraught with problems, according to acclaimed biographer Andrew Morton, who wrote the book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Thomas Jr smoked weed all day and even her mother would share a joint with a neighbor, while TV lighting director Thomas worked night and day, and wild teen Samantha would be out clubbing.Doria and Thomas had married at the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple on Sunset Blvd, in a \u0027hippie wedding\u0027 in December 1979.They orced four years later and Meghan went to live with her mother in a top-floor apartment on S. Cloverdale Ave, Mid-Wilshire.It was once the garage and loft space for the main front property.This was recently renovated and is currently for rent at $3,950 a month, ten times what her mother would have been paying over 30 years previously.Although Meghan lived in modest homes, she attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten called Little Red Schoolhouse which starts at $18,800 a year for kindergarten and $22,600 year for sixth-grade.  After her parents orced in 1983, Meghan and her mother Doria moved into a top-floor apartment (pictured) in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of LA. The apartment previously served as the garage and loft space of the main front property. The Duchess of Sussex split her time here and at her father\u0027s home until she graduated high school in 1999          Meghan and Doria lived behind this two-bedroom, one bathroom house (pictured) on South Cloverdale Avenue. Their home was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her father worked and where she spent time after schoolThe school was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her Emmy-winning father worked on the set of Married With Children and where she would spend her days after school.Her mother Doria, 62, had a less glamorous location for her line of business, which was still only a stone\u0027s throw away from the school - now called the Hollywood Schoolhouse.She owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea St in Hancock Park for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. As can be seen in our photos, the run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium, which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated.When Meghan moved on to the $15,900-a-year Immaculate Heart High School, which she attended from 1991 to 1999, she lived with her dad on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition.This is where Thomas recently said in an interview that he\u0027d warned his daughter off the controversial religion after catching her lingering outside the building.Her father\u0027s apartment was on the ground floor and had two tiny bedrooms with bars across the windows.She lived there until she was 17. Now the place has been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years.

According to a biography on the duchess, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week,\u0027 however, as she got older, there was friction between the two since she felt she was the one who was mothering her father          Not so shabby: The home has since been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years. Pictured above is the large living space of the Hollywood home   The two-bedroom, two-bath home located in the heart of Hollywood is now listed for rent.

It was a source of friction, especially when she started dating,\u0027 the book states. Meghan also had various part-time jobs and volunteer work including bussing tables and serving food at the Hippie Kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles, a Catholic set up to help the homeless living in the notorious Skid Row.She was an assistant at the Paper Store in Beverly Hills, where she also taught calligraphy, and served frozen yogurt at Humphrey Yogart, in Sherman Oaks.When she left high school to attend Northwestern University in Illinois she met film producer Trevor Engelson in a bar on one of her visits back home in LA.Royal reporter claims journalists are being kept at a...Meghan Markle \u0027is at her wits\u0027 end over her father\u0027s public...Share this article \u0027When Meghan first met him on that night out in West Hollywood, she liked what she saw and was attracted to his passion, drive, and ambition.

Engelson reportedly still lives there todayYet it was her childhood that defined Meghan, the aspiring actress and now adored royal. \u0027While her childhood experiences were the crucible that set her on the path to activism,\u0027 says Morton.\u0027Her mother believes that she was hardwired from birth to try to make the world a better and more equal place. In short, she had a moral compass.\u0027Despite wanting to be a Hollywood star, it was her faith that was equally important and the central pillar for Meghan and Doria. So much so, that we can disclose she was once a youth minister for the Agape International Spiritual Center, which her mum is still a member today, along with TV host Oprah Winfrey.Sharon Fox, now an executive producer at California Motion Picture Company, was also a member and told her Facebook followers about bumping into the duchess and her husband Prince Harry in Dublin earlier this month.\u0027It was such a nice surprise to bump into them when I went to Dublin to view the Book of Kells. Meghan was very sweet and I had a short chat with her during her stop on the walk about regarding our church, the Agape International Spiritual Center, and our mutual minister, Reverend Michael Bernard Beckwith... Meghan was a youth minister at my church, Agape, in LA years ago when I used to volunteer with the babies and toddlers on Church Sunday at Agape… I can not recall if I ever met her back then but it is clear she radiates that Agape spirit where ever she goes.\u0027 The Chuckle Brothers are airport assistants in ChuckleVisionDuchess of Sussex leaves Charlie van Straubenzee\u0027s weddingSamantha Eastwood\u0027s sister and her ex-fiance bring flowers to houseSaudi Arabia expels Canadian ambassador and freezes all tradeBen Stokes fights with men after allegedly mocking \u0027camp behaviour\u0027Travellers leave rubbish on Cobham green after eviction in MayChuckle Brothers host hilarious new show from their own living roomMen play football on M6 as motorway is closed after a crashDriver unexpectedly meets low-flying helicopter on misty roadFootage shows ants build incredible bridge to raid wasps nestEngland cricketer Ben Stokes arrives at court to face trialMeghan celebrates 37th birthday at wedding of Harry\u0027s best friendHer new digs: Meghan\u0027s childhood homes are a far cry from her new home in Kensington Palace (pictured)           Meghan and Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage, opposite Princess Diana\u0027s former home The Chuckle Brothers are airport assistants in ChuckleVisionDuchess of Sussex leaves Charlie van Straubenzee\u0027s weddingSamantha Eastwood\u0027s sister and her ex-fiance bring flowers to houseSaudi Arabia expels Canadian ambassador and freezes all tradeBen Stokes fights with men after allegedly mocking \u0027camp behaviour\u0027Travellers leave rubbish on Cobham green after eviction in MayChuckle Brothers host hilarious new show from their own living roomMen play football on M6 as motorway is closed after a crashDriver unexpectedly meets low-flying helicopter on misty roadFootage shows ants build incredible bridge to raid wasps nestEngland cricketer Ben Stokes arrives at court to face trialMeghan celebrates 37th birthday at wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/10/016924E7000004B0-0-image-a-19_1533547876041.jpg","title":"Campaigners call Theresa ban eating dogs Britain","story":"    A vendor waits for buyers beside dogs in cages at a market in Yulin in southern China\u0027s Guangxi province Risky snack!

In the US, people who eat dog meat are mainly immigrants from Asia.\u0027           Last night Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said a ban on eating dogs is absolutely rightDowning Street said it will be examining the decision made by US Congress but did not clarify if it would support a ban.Theresa May\u0027s official spokesman told a Westminster media briefing: \u0027The commercial trade in dog meat in the UK is illegal, but we will look closely at the decision taken in the US.\u0027Britain is a nation of animal lovers and we continue to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. We wish to maintain that.\u0027  Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, who owns a prize-winning cockapoo called Noodle, has urged the Prime Minister to tackle the issue. Last night he dubbed a full ban \u0027absolutely right\u0027,The Sun reported.Sir Alan said: \u0027There is no need in the modern world for this disgusting habit. We should nip it in the bud now to make sure the practice never takes off here. A civilised country is decent to animals, so let\u0027s be fully decent here.\u0027             Campaigners are calling on Theresa May to ban the eating of dogs in BritainChairman of the All-party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group Lisa Cameron MP is one of those supporting the ban on dog meat consumption.She said: \u0027We are urging the Government to bring in a ban. We are concerned by the World Dog Alliances\u0027 report about dog food consumption in the UK.\u0027We want to send out a strong message that people don\u0027t want to see it here in the UK.\u0027The RSPCA has dismissed the idea that dog meat consumption is on the rise as its says existing legislation in the Animal Welfare Act 2006 prevents the widespread practice of it.   In a statement, the RSPCA, said: \u0027It is illegal to sell dog meat to the public in the UK. There are also no abattoirs that have a licence to kill dogs and it would be against slaughter and animal welfare legislation too. So, while dog meat eating is not specifically banned here these laws mean that there is effectively a ban on the practice.\u0027\u0027The RSPCA has no evidence that dog meat eating is on the rise in the UK, nor have we ever received any reports on this issue. While we do not believe it happens here, we continue to monitor the situation.\u0027 An estimated 30 million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia - with most stolen off the street. Dog meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.US Congress made its decision to ban the import, trade and consumption of dog meat after concerns that immigration from the Far East had seen it increase.The WDA has also been urging Asian countries to ban dog meat consumption.  Theresa May faces urgent calls to ban the eating of dogs in Britain after campaigners warn it is on the rise"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/12/4EDF6ABC00000578-6031177-image-a-39_1533554776446.jpg","title":"Women Ethiopias Mursi tribe traditional bottom lip plates","story":"    A woman from the Ethiopian Mursi tribe wears a headdress made from what appears to be water buffalo horns  Tradition: Two young Mursi women show off their lip plates, while scarification is visible on their upper bodiesThe lip-plate is a coming-of-age process for women in the Mursi tribe, with a teenage girl traditionally having her bottom lip pierced at around age 15.The cut is plugged with a piece of wood, and once this initial piercing has healed, the girl can begin stretching her lip with clay or wooden discs,  The dying tribes of Vietnam: Clans who once counted...Giving lions a sporting chance: The warriors of the Maasai...Inside the home of the loneliest man in the world: How last...Share this articleThe Mursi women often carve their own patterns and designs into their lip plates, which can vary in size.Once healed and stretched, the women suffer no discomfort, and apart from minor effects on her speech, the disc does not impair her health.            Stunning: A young woman wears an elaborate head dress in the Omo Valley in southwest Ethiopia          The lip-plate is a coming-of-age process for women in the Mursi tribe, with a teenage girl traditionally having her bottom lip pierced at around age 15          Isolated: There are less than 10,000 members of the Mursi tribe, who live in the isolated Omo Valley          Craft: Mursi women often carve their own patterns and designs into their lip plates, often made of clay or wood          Traditional life: A Mursi woman holds her lip disc in her hand as she peers out from a hut in the Omo ValleyMany of the woman also have have scarification on their bodies - cuts  across their skin which heal into scar patterns.These amazing photographs were taken by 38-year-old tour operator Evi Aryati Arbay from Jakarta, Indonesia.He said: \u0027The Mursi tribe were a truly fascinating group.\u0027The incredible lip discs are worn by their women, while many of the men have scars on their shoulders that represent how many enemies they have killed during encounters with intruders in their territory.\u0027You cannot enter the reserve without an armed guard.\u0027   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/14/4EE07B5800000578-6031399-image-a-63_1533561885460.jpg","title":"Bologna airport explosion near motorway northern Italy","story":"    A huge explosion has taken place near an airport in Italy this afternoon amid reports or a road smash involving a petrol tanker  Police have said the blast could be felt in the busy terminal and was caused by an accident on the nearby motorway Video shows a massive explosion just yards from cars on the carriageway and people sprinting to safety down the roadPolice have said the blast could be felt in the busy terminal and was caused by an accident on the nearby motorway.

This photograph was taken in 1970. A sign outside a storefront advertises Sammy\u0027s Bowery Follies, a e bar with cabaret-style live entertainment that catered to the down-and-out. Its owner Sammy Fuchs passed away in 1969 and the bar closed a year later. Today a Whole Foods and other restaurants are in this location          It\u0027s tough work, but someone\u0027s got to do it: Maisel took this photograph of a man asleep in a cart full of soft drink cans on the Lower East Side          Award-winning photographer Jay Maisel has captured thousands of images showcasing the transformation of New York through the decades. The 87-year-old is pictured in his home studio in BrooklynIt was on Bowery in 1966, an area in the pits of its decline that Maisel bought a six-story, 72-room, former Germania Bank building at 190 Bowery and made it his home for next 49 years - until the rising cost of running it, day to day, prompted him to sell. The building was - and remains - iconic in the area and Maisel rented out his top floors to other artists including Roy Lichtenstein, the master of pop art, and abstract expressionist Adolph Gottlieb. He fended off offers to buy from developers and rock stars. Mick Jagger once approached him through a representative with an offer to buy the 35,000sq-ft space. Maisel wasn\u0027t interested. In this time, gentrification took ahold around him. In the 1990s and 2000s, the homeless population decreased, the streets were cleaned up. Dozens of independent bars and mom and pop stores could no longer afford their skyrocketing rent. Mars bar and CBGB shut their doors too, to much protest.   Perhaps the most glaring example of the area\u0027s gentrification is that in 2015 Maisel sold the bank building he\u0027d bought for $102,000 in 1966 (the equivalent of $776,094.07 in today\u0027s money), for $55million. Some called it the \u0027greatest real estate coup of all time\u0027. Maisel was just sorry to leave. He told DailyMail.com: ‘When I first moved there it wasn’t super dangerous or anything, but it was super depressing.  \u0027Guys on your sidewalk, guys on your steps, you had to be judicious on who you threw off your steps and who you didn’t. Because some of the guys you knew you’d have big trouble if you tried to get rid of them.’ ‘I always treated everyone really nice, I never tried to demean anyone or treat them in any way less than a human. But there was times where you had to be firm with them.’           There may be snow on the ground but this man, whose tattoos show a crudely drawn skull and crossbones along with the words Hell\u0027s Angel across his back, didn\u0027t wear a coat - or a shirt. A passer-by is bundled up in a coat and hat          Crime and grime: ‘When I first moved there it wasn’t super dangerous or anything, but it was super depressing.

The bar remains open today          Plus, the access his building provided at 190 Bowery to shoot street scenes from his windows or rooftop went unmatched. Pictured above is a photo he took of the Resolvent Building and a clothes line in Bowery  Maisel spends most of his days sorting through the thousands of slides he has of images he captured during his career in an effort to digitize and catalogue them. Pictured above is an image he snapped while in the LES showing men hanging out on their fire escapes          Maisel often took advantage of the incredible views from inside his massive 72-room residence at 190 Bowery. In 1966 he purchased the iconic former Germania Bank building at the corner of Bowery and Spring Streets for $102,000, which is the   the equivalent of $776,094.07 today.

But he would also capture what are now iconic images of those artists. In fact, one of the most notable images of Davis is one that Maisel captured – it’s the cover photo of Davis’ 1959 Kind of Blue album.           Speaking to DailyMail.com from inside his spacious home studio, where the walls are full of his favorite eye-catching images (including a large photo showing the side profile of Lady Day pictured above his right shoulder), the father-of-one explained in between sips of cold bottled water just how much his old neighborhood has transformed          He started taking his camera and shot images of everything and everyone around him. Pictured above is a photo he captured showing two men sleeping on a mattress on a rooftop - an image he captured from his own rooftop at 190 Bowery  Maisel even took his camera with him on amusement rides, capturing moments like the one pictured above left showing a couple kissing while riding a Ferris Wheel in one of the Lower Manhattan neighborhoods decades ago. His prolific photo collection truly showcases the drastic changes Manhattan has experienced over the decades with mom and pop businesses shuttering due to high rents and luxury sky rise apartments popping up in their place, specifically in the LES and Bowery which are now hipster havens          Early on in his career, Maisel could often be found at jazz clubs in the Big Apple, listening to legends like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis perform. But he would also capture what are now iconic images of those same artists. In fact, one of the most notable images of Davis is one that Maisel captured – it’s the cover photo of Davis’ 1959 Kind of Blue album. Pictured above is an image Maisel took of workers removing damaged pieces from a nearby building after a fire took place          Maisel noted that he was ‘very fortunate’ during the beginning stages of his career because people would often purchase the images straight out of his portfolio.  Pictured above is an image Maisel captured showing the entrance to one of the city\u0027s bridges near Chinatown, which is drastically different today          Maisel’s building easily became an icon of the community as he once rented out the top floors to other artists like Adolph and Roy Lichtenstein. He repeatedly had to turn down offers from people and developers desiring to buy it, including Mick Jagger who approached Maisel through a representative at one point with an offer for the 35,000-square-foot space. The views from the various windows inside the building always seemed to offer a peak into the variety of his neighbor\u0027s activities, such as the image he captured above showing a man napping while the people above him in a different space have a nude photo shoot‘I was interested in a lot of different things. I used to shoot a lot of dance, I shot a lot of jazz, I just went out and shot,’ Maisel said of his career early on.‘You know it was easier to do then because there were no big hoops you had to jump through to get permission to shoot. You didn’t have to deal with publicists reviewing your work. And basically I didn’t do it for anybody, I did it for myself.‘Later on I got assignments to shoot and that was a different kind of game all together. But mostly I liked shooting for myself.’Maisel noted that he was ‘very fortunate’ during the beginning stages of his career because people would often purchase the images straight out of his portfolio. ‘I started doing a lot of stock photography and for me stock photography meant do whatever you want, and maybe you will sell it,’ he added.‘But if you don’t sell it at least you did what you wanted to. So a lot of stock photographers would shoot in order to sell that kind of picture, but I never thought that was much fun.’By the mid-1960s, he had earned enough money working in the industry as a stock image photographer that he decided to make the big purchase on the former bank building, after nearly everyone he asked advised him against it.‘I completely and irrevocably was told by everyone this is something you shouldn’t do,’ he quipped.‘People would say “This is the dumbest thing you’ve ever done. Are you out of your mind? How are you going to carry this man?”. The building was not a good look on the outside, but I saw the space inside and was crazy. I loved it.’           He explained: ‘I started doing a lot of stock photography and for me stock photography meant do whatever you want, and maybe you will sell it.\u0027 The image above Maisel captured shows a man wearing a suit and hat while reading a newspaper outside of a bright red building in the Lower East Side. The man\u0027s style is something few would sport today in the hipster neighborhood          Maisel truly captured photos of anything and everything around the city, including the image above of two men carrying a huge piece of material off a truck in the Bowery neighborhood. He said: ‘But if you don’t sell it at least you did what you wanted to. So a lot of stock photographers would shoot in order to sell that kind of picture, but I never thought that was much fun.\u0027  By the mid-1960s, Maisel had earned enough money working in the industry as a stock image photographer that he decided to make the big purchase on the former bank building, after nearly everyone he asked advised him against it. Pictured above is an image he captured while living in the area of a man hanging out of a window right, a woman peers from her window          He said that once he saw the space inside 190 Bowery he loved it. Pictured above is an image of a steel worker Maisel captured from the rooftop of his building, which provided him 360 degree views of Lower Manhattan          Day in and day out he would capture images from the rooftop or the various window views showcasing the neighborhood from his building at 190 Bowery. Pictured above is one photo he snapped from his rooftop of a fire burning nearby           Pictured above are two girls riding the Ferris Wheel during a small fair in the city that Maisel captured. He also recounted how he would constantly receive offers from people and companies seeking to buy the building from him. ‘I have a whole file of people who wanted to buy the bank. I never had a broker on that deal. But people would come to me all the time,’ he said.          The octogenarian added: ‘And I remember even as I lived there, you couldn’t walk down Spring Street on a weekend without hearing nine different languages from tourists that come there. By now it’s all gentrified and it’s a lot less interesting. You know it’s like an outdoor mall.’ Pictured above is a young girl hanging out of a car window in Chinatown - which in recent years has been plagued by even more gentrification like Maisel mentioned          Pictured above is an image showing the exterior of Maisel\u0027s former home at 190 Bowery. The graffiti covering the building led many to believe the building was vacant when in fact it wasn\u0027t. Three years after selling, it still remains covered in graffiti (pictured above in 2018) Day in and day out he would capture images from the rooftop or the various window views showcasing the neighborhood from his building at 190 Bowery.His prolific photo collection showcases the drastic changes Manhattan has experienced over the decades with mom and pop businesses shuttering due to high rents and luxury sky rise apartments popping up in their place, specifically in the LES.‘The transition was very subtle and very slow. I never thought the Bowery would get to be where it is now, in my lifetime,’ he shared.‘I figured I’m going to die here, it will be fine because this is the best building anyone could possibly ever have.‘But then it got better, and retail stores moved into the neighborhood, Armani opened on Broadway. This place opened and another place opened and then suddenly the whole thing snowballed.‘By now it’s all gentrified and it’s a lot less interesting. You know it’s like an outdoor mall.’The octogenarian added: ‘And I remember even as I lived there, you couldn’t walk down Spring Street on a weekend without hearing nine different languages from tourists that come there.’Maisel also recounted how he would constantly receive offers from people and companies seeking to buy the building from him.‘I have a whole file of people who wanted to buy the bank. I never had a broker on that deal.

But at that point it became obvious that it made sense and I was running out of options and money. But selling it, the price was good.’The $55million sale of the graffiti covered building is still one of the most notable real estate deals to occur in the Big Apple. In making history across the bridge in Brooklyn, Maisel’s subsequent $15million purchase of a town home in Cobble Hill also made headlines as one of the most expensive purchases in the borough’s history.‘I miss Manhattan, I love Manhattan.

Of people wanting to buy 190 Bowery from him, Maisel said: ‘We had a call one time where a representative for Mick Jagger said that he wanted to buy the bank, and we said it’s not for sale. “You don’t understand it’s Mick Jagger!” and I said, “You don’t understand it’s not for sale.”’          While living in the bank building, he captured the above image showing a man with his head in between large cement blocks that look fresh. Of the notable building and neighborhood he called home for decades, Maisel said:‘I figured I’m going to die here, it will be fine because this is the best building anyone could possibly ever have. But then it got better, and retail stores moved into the neighborhood, Armani opened on Broadway. This place opened and another place opened and then suddenly the whole thing snowballed.\u0027          Maisel shot images no matter what the weather was outside in the Big Apple, including snow storms like the photo above showing a man dressed up while walking in the snow in the neighborhood          Of the city\u0027s transformation, he said: ‘The transition was very subtle and very slow. I never thought the Bowery would get to be where it is now, in my lifetime.\u0027 Pictured above is a man walking during a snowstorm in one of the Lower Manhattan neighborhoods           He captured the photo above of men chatting with each other on a corner in the LES.

Maisel had no plans of selling his home, but as time went on the expenses to operate the 72-room space skyrocketed. So in 2015, he gave up his 360 degree rooftop view of Manhattan - which provided amazing views during fireworks shows like the one above          He also captured the image above showing snow on roof tops around his building at 190 Bowery. In 1995, Maisel decided to quit shooting commercial photographs and get back to his roots of capturing images for himself. But that move caused his income to decline and after a while he ran out of money          Concrete jungle where dreams are made: Or even better views could be seen on the roof top at 190 Bowery when storms rolled over the city like the one above.

It all started this spring when she launched the Lady Factory, a one-night pop-up centered around women’s issues for Women’s Day. It was such a success, having been called the woke girl’s version of the pop-up museum, she decided to continue it on a larger scale and for a longer period of time – but still within the context of the selfie museum.“We wanted to turn this trend on its head,” said Shaw. “These places exist for no other reason than to take pictures with the pop-up as the backdrop, it’s a one-dimensional vanity exercise. But we find tension in putting something with substance in that backdrop and creating a narrative based on statistics that demonstrates gender bias.”It was partly inspired by the recent wave of feminist activism including #MeToo, Time’s Up and the Women’s March. “With women banding together to speak out in this moment, it is very resonant,” she said.“Packaging this content in a colorful masquerade is not normally how feminist conversations look,” she said. “We’re presenting something that is highly stylized but is underpinned with how we are not paid equally, which is more true for women of color, or how we’re treated as objects. Women revel in posting their ideas with their photos.”But making these issues more playful with pink-painted sets and plastic toy-like accessories could easily be misread the wrong way.“We’re not diminishing the import of the issues we’re raising them in front of a wider, partially unengaged audience,” said Shaw. “When you present feminist thinking in a way that’s relatable and approachable, everyone becomes an activist.”It’s also a way to bring ideas to a younger audience, as there are declining art museum attendees for millennial-aged museum-goers who might discover art on Instagram and Pinterest before stepping foot in a gallery or museum.Especially with the politan Museum of Art in New York City’s entrance fee hike for all non-New Yorkers, engaging youth continues to be a challenge, which is why museums are turning to special hashtags and even phone charging stations.There are “the future is female” T-shirts at shopping malls, but Shaw wants to dig deeper beyond the “pink it and shrink it” trend.“We have made something candy-colored but there is irony in what we’re doing,” she said. “We’re trying to make something women will genuinely respond to because of the substance, not because of the look of it.”In the “corporate climb” room, which is focused around how few women are at the upper ranks of management, when one climbs to the top of the pink wall, nothing special is awaiting climbers. “We’re still clawing our way to get up there, to create a way to get to the top,” said Shaw. “We’re trying to mirror reality as we see it today.”The “moneymaker” room is filled with fake dollar bills and a fan so the money blows around like a tornado, which is meant to tap into the wage gap.“Women don’t hit their peak earning potential until we’re well into our careers,” said Shaw. “Women retire with little money, many grow up with ‘that’s the man’s thing to do’, but women live longer than men. This financial conversation is what women have been left out of.”The ball room of breasts called “the sea of objectification” has been nicknamed as the “tit pit” on social media, but that is beside the point.“It’s provocative to have a pit full of breasts, as it can come off as tone deaf, is this what we’re saying what women are? A stack of breasts?” asks Shaw. “This is the antithesis of what we are, we’re saying society treats us like anatomical objects, play things, non-real beings with agency.”A portion of the installation’s $28.45 entry fee will donate funds to the National Women’s Law Center and other women’s organizations, but Shaw hopes visitors will take action in their own lives, as well.“I’m hoping people will donate to causes, that’s what we’re focused on,” said Shaw. “I also hope the topics invite women to speak out and ask about wage audit at their work it’s interesting to bring this conversation into a pop-up museum, to bring this spirit of activism to it.”The title of the exhibition is a bit vague, but that seems to be the point – “That Lady Thing” – which is a bit sarcastic, but references a kind of ignorance.“That’s how men would talk about this if they didn’t understand it, ‘Oh you know that lady thing’,” said Shaw. “It captures the micro-bias and micro-aggression we all feel in certain spaces it’s dismissive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07c907f7adc66ae441056205c304cdb5cabcad42/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9b0222035e7f3b811f1822994e9885be 1400w","title":"britain hot summer brings best july in five years for food sellers","story":"BRC says spending on eating, drinking and keeping cool masks weak consumer demandBritain’s hot summer has masked the weakness of consumer demand by prompting the sharpest monthly growth in food spending in five years, the latest snapshot of the high street has shown.The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the main beneficiaries of the long, dry spell were supermarkets and pubs as well as shops selling fans and other cooling equipment, but that other parts of the sector suffered.Food retailers reported their best sales for July in five years as households prepared for barbecues and picnics but the extra spending came at the expense of stores selling goods for the home.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said: “Last month’s sweltering temperatures kept shoppers focused on eating, drinking and keeping cool. Food sales had their best July in five years, while fans and cooling equipment flew off the shelves.“However, total sales growth slowed as the heat laid bare the underlying weakness in consumer spending. Sales of non-food products struggled. Three months into an extended period of summer weather, demand for many seasonal purchases has slowed while the heat has kept shoppers away from days spent browsing new ranges. For many in the industry, autumn could not come sooner.”“Although changing consumer behaviour means we will have fewer shops in future, the reality is that if we want to support a positive reinvention of our high streets, business rates cannot go on increasing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2a1c02ff25fd9ecd3d1dba79b967692c2f861e0/0_9_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28c9ad1b201d2dcf2958c6ecae359f0b","title":"weight watchers adds 1m subscribers in a year","story":"“We have embarked on an exciting journey – from being the global leader in weight management to becoming the world’s partner in wellness,” said Mindy Grossman, its president and chief executive, in a statement after trading closed on Wall Street. Analysts credited the company’s recent success to a strategic shift away from mere weight loss and toward products that target holistic wellness. “Consumers are looking at healthy lifestyles, mental wellbeing,” Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy told Investor Business Daily. “Once upon a time, weight management was all about what you ate. Now any activity can be translated into Weight Watchers points.”While users’ waistlines have been shrinking, the firm has enjoyed accelerating sales growth for the past five quarters, reflecting the involvement of Winfrey and the company’s success in recruiting social media influencers including Hollywood director Kevin Smith and DJ Khaled.Technology has been key to Weight Watchers’ transformation. Fitness tracking devices now offer members FitPoints for activities such as walking, cleaning or dancing. Those points are then scaled to determine a member’s daily diet allowances.Kara Anderson, an analyst at B Riley FBR, said Smith’s endorsement of the company soon after suffering a heart attack in February and then chronicling his “wellness journey” and attributing his success to Weight Watchers had been particularly potent. Despite some disappointment with the latest Weight Watchers results, the company is still far above the record low of $3.75 it reached in July 2015 when Winfrey acquired 6.4m shares and signed on to a five-year deal to be the face of the firm. By October that year, Winfrey’s five-year deal had already netted her $50m in share appreciation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf395df5cf36d95a44f5a97225bc3909a8b50209/0_256_2700_1619/master/2700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e39cd35d1091cc324dfe561dbfe20a6","title":"beyonce vogue september issue slaveowner ancestry","story":"Beyoncé’s reconciliation of her ancestry reminds us that we live in danger of allowing narratives we didn’t generate to tell our stories for usThis morning, Beyoncé’s September cover of Vogue magazine was released. Beyoncé and her team, led by Tyler Mitchell, her handpicked 23-year-old photographer, exercised extraordinary control over the issue, from the cover to even the captions of each photograph. And it was with that control that Beyoncé invited Vogue’s readers to understand her without impediment. The issue includes Beyoncé in Her Own Words, as she discusses experiences that range from pregnancy and body acceptance to the importance of legacy for her and her children. But perhaps most potent is one of Beyoncé’s shortest reflections: “I researched my ancestry recently and learned that I come from a slave owner who fell in love with and married a slave.”It is this research, this understanding of where we come from, that will aid black people in, as Beyoncé says, “connecting to the past”. Living our lives informed by the history that “makes us both bruised and beautiful” will likely be the only way for us to begin reconciling with our past. Without this history, we live in danger of allowing narratives we didn’t generate telling our stories for us.When armed with these narratives, we can start to rectify past injustices. For instance, in 2016, Georgetown University announced it would offer “preferential treatment in the admissions process to prospective students descended from enslaved people owned by the university”. Georgetown’s own archival and ancestral research, in partnership with genealogists, revealed that 272 slaves were sold by Georgetown to keep the school’s budgetary house in order. Georgetown wasn’t alone in this discovery. By 2016, well over a dozen other prestigious institutions had begun interrogating their own sordid histories with slavery.Exploring ancestry isn’t just an activity assumed by the academic institutions. In fact, it has become a popular activity for many Americans. According to the MIT Technology Review, in 2017, “genetic genealogy tests more than doubled” and “now exceeds 12m”. And with PBS specials like Finding Your Roots, hosted by Skip Gates, ancestral roots exploration has become more accessible. But Tony Burroughs, founder of the Center for Black Genealogy, warns that “tracing African American ancestry can be particularly difficult”. Colonialism and slavery have made unearthing ancestral roots slightly more difficult for countless African Americans. Enter the Robert Frederick Smith Explore Your Family History center at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The center is on the second floor of the museum and is a place where people can “find digital resources related to family history, receive expert guidance on how to conduct genealogical research”. Robert Smith, now the richest black person in the United States, funded this effort to “capture all of the records of the African American experience”.While the collection isn’t exhaustive and more needs to be done, the true benefits of these digitized records, for Smith, lie in the living nature of the records and the unprecedented levels of accessibility to them. These records live on through the Community Curation online platform, which enables “participants to share their stories by uploading digitized photographs and video”. For Smith, “the real beauty is to give everybody a chance to put their family’s history and their narrative as part of the US here in a place that is accessible”.Beyoncé’s mention of her ancestry might have passed us by in the visual splendor of the cover issue. But make no mistake: it mattered. Discovering who we are, what injustices we endured and at whose hands creates the necessary pretext for reconciliation. For Beyoncé, her ancestry unearthed an opportunity to disrupt “generational curses” and to ensure her children can live “less complicated lives”. For Georgetown, their look back ensured greater efforts toward education parity among races by offering preferential admissions treatment. And for the countless many who will visit the Smith Center, it may mean piecing together their family’s permanent place in the building of this country. Rediscovering, reclaiming and reconciling our ancestral history comprises a noble enterprise in defining for ourselves who we are and hope to be, by telling the world who we’ve been.

Here’s how journalists can take actionAt a certain point, it became impossible not to talk about QAnon.For readers not yet familiar with the story, QAnon is a conspiracy theory centering on a figure calling themselves Q, who has for months made outrageous and unsubstantiated claims about and allegedly from within the Trump administration. Robert Muller, Hillary Clinton, and many others have figured into the pro-Trump narrative, to the extent that Q’s cryptic proclamations – which began on 4chan in late 2017 and later migrated to 8chan and parts of Reddit – could be described as a traditional narrative.Over the last year, the QAnon conspiracy theory has generated intermittent bursts of coverage. What had been a simmering narrative became a fireworks factory explosion on 1 August, when some attendees of a Trump campaign-style rally in Tampa, Florida, showed up carrying “Q” signs. According to Joan Donovan, research lead at Data \u0026amp Society’s Media Manipulation Initiative, this appears to have been a coordinated effort to grab reporters’ attention.It worked. Suddenly, news organizations began clamoring for information. What was QAnon? How could such a false and ridiculous narrative become so popular with so many people? What did we miss?The resulting coverage can be ided into three basic categories: explainers, which don’t just e into the intricacies of the conspiracy, but often include a glossary of key terms hair-on-fire warnings about how dangerous and frightening the conspiracy is and smug declarations that of course Trump supporters believe in something so stupid. As Abby Ohlheiser has noted, the tone and breakneck frequency of this coverage was immediately uproarious to participants, a great victory for what their supporters call the “great awakening”, often delivered with a characteristically trollish wink.The networked coordination of participants, cycle after cycle of mainstream coverage, and participants’ subsequent raucous laughter show that while the QAnon narrative itself might be confusing and convoluted, the coverage surrounding the QAnon narrative has been distressingly predictable. The story has advanced like clockwork.I have been studying the gears of this mechanism for the last 10 years, beginning with my research into subcultural trolling on and around 4chan’s “b” board, at the time the site’s most infamous and active board (that title has since been usurped by 4chan’s pol board).The primary focus of this work was the symbiotic relationship between participating trolls and the news media: the fact that trolls needed journalists to amplify their attacks (and they found the reporting funny), and some journalists needed trolls to give them sensational things to write about.The troll space has shifted in profound and striking ways over time (as I and my co-authors have previously argued). Participants on sites such as 4chan and 8chan have too you can’t draw a perfectly straight line between trolling of the past and far-right extremism of the present.That said, many journalistic responses to trollish media manipulation tactics have remained constant. What this coverage has always done is incentivize precisely the behaviors it purports to condemn. In the process, it ensures that the same tactics will be used in the future – because the tactics are proven to work.The question before us is this: how can we all do this better, so that we are not, once again, forced to comment on stories like QAnon? How do we not paint ourselves into that same old corner?I lay out a number of better practices – for establishing newsworthiness for reporting on objectively false information, coordinated manipulation campaigns, bigots, and abusers – in my recently published Data \u0026amp Society report The Oxygen of Amplification. The following is an overview of the primary takeaways from that work.The first strategy is, most basically, not to report on things – at least not until the stories reach what Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan have identified as the “tipping point”, when the story becomes relevant to people outside the community in which the behavior occurs.The second strategy, particularly important when covering hate, is to employ what Donovan and danah boyd describe as “strategic silence”. Just because a group does or says something doesn’t mean it bears repeating. There are other factors to consider before reporting, most notably what impact the coverage will have on the targets of the potential story’s subjects, whether that impact is further intimidation, dehumanization, or physical harm.Coverage isn’t just about the coverage itself, in other words. How and whether to cover a story must also hinge on what the story might do, and whose interests it will ultimately serve.In the case of QAnon, debunking and explainer stories can be interesting and helpful for readers who already believe the conspiracy is absurd they provide those readers more information, greater contextual understanding, and a richer vocabulary for describing something they already know.For other audiences, however, attempts to debunk and explain the intricacies of the story can have a very different impact. First, the people spreading the conspiracy couldn’t ask for a better outcome journalists covering the story help spread the narrative so much further and so much faster than it would have traveled otherwise. Participants in the QAnon narrative have giddily affirmed exactly this point posts to the “Great Awakening” subreddit have outrightly thanked journalists for the coverage and for the resulting wave of new participants.More concerningly, for those who sincerely believe the conspiracy to be true, or for those who may not be true believers but who do truly mistrust mainstream journalism, debunkings can actually serve to confirm the story – a logically valid conclusion to draw if someone believes that everything journalists say is a lie. (For more on this head-spinning complication, see Alice Marwick’s exploration of why people share false narratives, and Francesca Tripodi’s analysis of “alternative facts” and news sources within conservative political thought).Beyond asking what impact a story might have, journalists must ask what is not known about the story, and how this lack of knowledge undermines clear-headed threat assessments.For example, the overwhelming majority of QAnon coverage has taken for granted that the people who participate in the QAnon narrative believe the narrative. Some sure seem to. But in an environment ruled by Poe’s law, an online axiom stating that sincerity online is often indistinguishable from satire, it is not possible to know who is genuinely sold on the narrative, who is pretending to be sold to mess with reporters, and who is doing a little bit of both.By operating on the unchallenged, unquestioning assumption that everyone who holds the proverbial or literal “Q” sign is fully convinced of the conspiracy’s veracity, reporters don’t just help spread the narrative, they lend credence to it. After all, taking the narrative so seriously signals that it is in fact worth taking seriously. Reporters’ credulous coverage also feeds into a range of unintended narratives. For those who are actively engaged in media manipulation, it underscores’ journalists gullibility and exploitability (and is very funny to participants). For those who believe the narrative sincerely, it affirms that QAnon adherents are really on to something otherwise mainstream journalists wouldn’t be in such a panic.The final question reporters must ask themselves stems from the fact that journalists aren’t just part of the game of media manipulation.

But because parliament is not sitting, the sun is out and everything slows down at this time of year, the atmosphere of crisis has dissipated. It is a curious phenomenon: EU membership expires next March, but relentless motion towards a deadline doesn’t bring any sense of advance towards a destination. Westminster cycles between chaos and calm, oddly detached from the reality of what must be achieved without time to spare. This is one thing that strikes me after a month away from the UK. I didn’t go far, only to France, but it was distance enough to notice how, from the outside, British politics manages to look frenetic and stuck at the same time.Theresa May was also in France at the end of last week. She held talks with Emmanuel Macron at the Fort de Brégançon, a Mediterranean retreat for French presidents since Charles de Gaulle. Or rather, she talked and he listened. The disparity in how much was at stake for the two leaders shone through every account. The British prime minister was depicted as desperate for help from European capitals to rehabilitate a Brexit plan that is only a few weeks old but already ailing. There was no sense of Macron needing anything in return no discussion of how he should play it.Many French media reports digressed on to the symbolic question of Brégançon, how it was back in play as a diplomatic stage after a period of neglect. The semiotics of presidential power were more of a talking point than anything the president himself might actually do about Brexit.Macron hasn’t had an easy summer. French politics has been consumed by l’affaire Benalla – the scandal of a presidential bodyguard caught on film, wearing police insignia to which he was not entitled, beating demonstrators. It has raised questions about\u0026nbspunaccountable power and the culture of arrogance\u0026nbsparound a notoriously self-regarding president. France went into political meltdown and yet, as I watched it happen, I couldn’t help marvelling at how tame, how monochrome it all felt, relative to the\u0026nbsppsychedelic unravelling of Westminster around the\u0026nbspsame time.This is not to belittle Alexandre Benalla’s offences. As scandals go, it’s a big ’un. But immersion in British politics had distorted my sense of scale. Next to Brexit, the story of the preening president’s rogue bodyguard looked almost old-fashioned – a crisis of manageable proportions. You could imagine it one day being discussed in the past tense. And if crisis is the mot juste for what has been happening in France, what the hell should you call the thing that Britain is going through?There is a common Eurosceptic proposition that the rest of Europe is complacent about Brexit. It is argued that a collapse of the negotiations, leading to disorderly rupture, damages the EU just as surely as it damages the UK – so continental politicians must be forced to confront the risks. Then they will be more flexible, if not from generosity then from awakened self-interest.No one in Paris, Berlin or Brussels doubts that Brexit is\u0026nbspdangerous for the EU and that the failure of talks would\u0026nbspbe disastrous. But what those who seek to mobilise that prospect for leverage in the negotiations fail to appreciate is how the whole threatening idiom – defiant swigging from the bottle marked “no deal” – completes the picture of a nation losing its balance, sliding out of control. British politics has turned crazy and the craziest politicians wave their craziness around as proof that they should be taken more seriously. The red-eyed, slurring drunk offers to demonstrate his sobriety by pouring out another drink without shpilling a\u0026nbspshingle drop.A booze-fuelled odyssey might contain many volatile scenes, experienced by the drinker as significant episodes: the stranger who becomes the new best friend the sudden explosive row expulsion from the pub. But from the outside, these are minor details when the salient story is the drinking itself.Over the course of one single week in July, the Brexit secretary and the foreign secretary both resigned, there were backbench rebellions and serial government humiliations, there was talk of no-confidence motions, leadership challenges, the prime minister falling, early elections … each day’s events might have qualified as crises in their own right.Combined, they might have been more than a crisis, yet somehow the sheer volume of mess actually diminished the impact. At least that’s what it looked like from France. It was a violent attack of gut spasms in a body politic tormented by a problem that it refuses to admit. It was Westminster vomiting a load of news on to the kerb before staggering towards the next bar.The government is so stupefied by Brexit it can hardly walk. Labour says the problem is not the drinking but the choice of drink. As if a slightly softer red from Jeremy Corbyn’s radical left cellar would succeed where the Tory right’s hard stuff has failed. An abstinence movement is growing but it lacks leadership.Or maybe we just haven’t hit the bottom yet. Maybe British politics just has to ride out a few more cycles of mania and denial. It resembles an addict’s compulsion to keep going, to repeat the degrading pattern again and again, because carrying on feels easier than stopping because to stop would mean a brutal audit of harm already done, relationships ruined, money squandered, poison already ingested. It is a painful reckoning, but not one that can be postponed for ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82592fe9a6f09bb07c6b37f01d0e83677de12998/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465b372698893343097ba222137aed78","title":"can cricket become the game of choice for young bme women","story":"Cricket has a huge following among the BME community – particularly south Asians – yet few women try their hand at the sport. Two Leicestershire women have set out to change thatGrowing up in Pakistan, Nafeesa Katib remembers watching cricket with her siblings on a TV hired at the weekend as a treat. It wasn’t a viewing choice at the time – it was the only thing being broadcast – but she remembers it fondly. “Even if we didn’t like cricket we had to watch it, and in the end all of us fell in love with the game,” she says. She remembers thinking: “Where are all the women on the cricket field?” That thought stuck with her after she moved to the UK as a teenager. Now 41, and living in Leicestershire with her husband and two children of her own, she is helping to redress that imbalance, in her role as a cricket coach for girls aged eight to 14. Her hope is to be a role model to all the girls who attend her sessions – but also to show, as a visibly Muslim woman playing and teaching cricket, that a headscarf need not stop anyone playing sport. “If you’ve got somebody who inspires you, who shows you, yes, I can do it, it’s a great feeling. And that’s what I try do,” says Katib.Women’s cricket has never been more popular in the UK – 2017 was a landmark year, as millions watched the England team triumph in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in front of a sold-out crowd at Lord’s. In the wake of that result, the cricket governing board said it was committed to getting more south Asian women involved in the game.One reason is the lack of appropriate coaching and facilities. In Oadby, where Katib lives, there were no organised sporting activities for her nine-year-old daughter on a Saturday morning – until cricket came along. “Most of the things are aimed at boys, like the football clubs for example,” says Katib. “There were some crafty things for girls, but not all girls are into arts and crafts.”Her friend and fellow coach Mai Kazi emphasises that the scheduling of sports sessions can be an issue, particularly for kids who come from a Muslim background. “Most of the Muslim kids in the area go to Islamic school between 4pm and 6pm, and that’s when most of the clubs are held,” says Kazi. But a Saturday morning works perfectly for her and her 13-year-old daughter, and the sessions are something they now do together. The coaches have worked hard to create a safe environment for girls from all backgrounds, who might be feeling apprehensive about throwing themselves into the game.“There are a few girls who wear headscarves,” says Katib. “The first time they came they were very nervous and really worried about them, with one hand touching their head at all times. But over time I’ve been able to give them a bit of confidence. At the end of the day, it’s all girls there.”Although having women run the sessions has boosted participation from the local Muslim and south Asian community, it’s the sight of two familiar faces that encourages parents to keep bringing their kids back. “A lot of the mums that drop their girls off know us from school,” says Kazi. “We live in a very small borough, so it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. There is obviously the sense of: ‘Oh, this is run by someone we know.’”She believes that community feeling is essential to the project’s success: “The fact it’s very local has really appealed to people – otherwise, they’d have to travel to Leicester, which isn’t always possible.”Katib has just completed her level two coaching certificate and hopes, one day, to run her own club. But the key thing for her is to keep showing her daughter there’s no such thing as a sport girls can’t do.“I’ve never wanted my daughter to think that certain things are only for girls, and that certain things are only for boys,” she says. “There shouldn’t be any limitations for anything.” In 2017 one of the key elements of Natwest’s partnership with the ECB was to help raise funding to open up even more opportunities for young people, both male and female, to enjoy cricket. This will continue in 2018.As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

During his workshop, at St Edmund Campion Catholic School near Birmingham, he tells a group of children how he was expelled from school for stabbing a schoolmate with a screwdriver – and how, as a teenager, he spent years running with gangs, carrying guns and knives, and dealing drugs.The urban youth specialist stares into the eyes of each member of his audience in turn as he explains what it was like to serve time in 11 different prisons. He tells the children, some as young as 12, about a friend who was stabbed to death 16 years ago: “I buried him.” He talks about a different friend who is in prison for life. “He asked me to tell you not to repeat his mistakes,” he says.His 12-week Crime Awareness Programme aims to take young people who have been identified as being at risk of exclusion from school, or falling foul of the law, and engage them in a positive activity to help them understand the risks and consequences of criminal behaviour.Provided in four West Midlands schools, the programme is backed by Chance to Shine, a charity that brings cricket to thousands of young people in inner-city areas. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine uses the sport to encourage social cohesion and steer youngsters away from antisocial behaviour and crime.His programme pulls no punches. With the help of some hard-hitting videos, he explains how some teenagers have even been sent to prison for life because they were part of a gang from which a different member murdered someone – known as “joint enterprise” prosecutions.Having delivered his wake-up call, he leads the children out into the sunshine to play cricket. With the composed, avuncular authority of a natural, he gathers them into a pre-game huddle and then encourages from the sidelines as they play in the sun. From the darkness and danger of gang life to the lightness and laughter of team spirit, it’s a powerful package.The youngsters play tape-ball cricket – a simple, inclusive and fun version of the game that uses plastic bats and a tennis ball wrapped in electrical tape. The six-a-side sessions last about 20 minutes.Sam says the contrast between the workshops and the cricket games is crucial. “The information in the workshops can be really hard-hitting, and in some cases the kids will have had similar things happen to friends or family members, so it might be a bit heavy for some iniduals,” he explains.“The cricket really lightens it up. It’s a great way to engage with them, to get them into teamwork and for them to come out of their comfort zone.”Sam says cricket is a “perfect game” for his mission, because it discourages star treatment. “In life, there is always going to be one boy or girl who is more charismatic, or more popular, and others who are more shy.“I want to give the shy iniduals a chance to shine, and encourage the more popular ones to tone it down a little bit. When we play cricket, we’re all on the same footing. It encourages teamwork and communication skills.”He has thought carefully about every aspect of his programme, right down to what he wears. “I need them to listen to me so I immerse myself in their culture,” he says. “The way I dress for these days, even my choice of trainers, is geared to show them that I understand what’s going on their lives.”His classroom vocabulary mirrors this. When he challenges one pupil for not paying attention, he tells them: “You’re not listening – you’re on some switch-off ting.”His energy is high throughout. “Kids who are in trouble are usually perpetually in fight-or-flight mode – their energy is different to other kids’, so I need to meet them where they are,” he says, bouncing from one foot to the other.One of the pupils, a 13-year-old boy, says he always thought cricket was “boring” but that he’s come to love it. “Before I started these workshops I was always in trouble and getting detentions, but now I’m not getting in any trouble. Cricket has really helped me.”A 16-year-old girl agrees, saying her friends have told her that they’ve seen a “really positive change” in her since she started the programme.She says Sam’s frankness about his own past makes it easier for her to trust him. “He’s taught me that life can be really dangerous, or really straightforward. It depends on which path you take.”One 12-year-old boy adds that the cricket sessions with Sam are his favourite part of school, and that he looks forward to them all week. “Tanayah’s my hero,” he smiles.Sam is proud of the effect his work is having. “To take kids who were on the road to being excluded from school and see them staying on to complete their GCSEs is amazing,” he says. “Statistics show that once a child is excluded, the chances of them going to prison are increased.”Surveys conducted at the beginning and end of a previous 12-week programme found the vast majority of those taking part experienced a change of heart towards knife and gang crime. At the start of the programme, about a fifth of the youngsters agreed with the statement that being in a gang made them safer by the end, only one person felt that way. Of those who started with no strong feelings either way, most disagreed strongly by the end.As for Sam, he says he turned his own life around when he discovered the teachings of Islam. “They showed me to value life, to value the law of the land,” he says. “I feel like this is what I’m here to do. Once upon a time, I called people to evil. Now I call people to good.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

You might even think of boxing: the city is home to some of the sport’s greatest exponents, including recent former world champion Tony Bellew and former British and Commonwealth champion David Price.But few people would associate Liverpool with cricket.Chance to Shine, the sports charity whose mission is to “spread the power of cricket throughout schools and communities” is hoping to change that. With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.“We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state. As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years. Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.“The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”“In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec4d788e0d5de993e7efd7bbb3fd18e7dd3b474/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78acc95bf51f0615da07c95fa9a975ac","title":"fortnite is coming to android phones but not through google play","story":"Epic Games bypasses the app store to offer its hugely successful online shooting game via its websiteEpic CEO, Tim Sweeney, said the company “wants to have a direct relationship with our customers on all platforms where possible ... physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required. We believe gamers will benefit from competition among software sources on Android.”“For any developer, going outside the established distribution channels and opting for a direct-to-consumer will be a major challenge, particularly on mobile where getting users to register and share payment details is an issue,” said Steve Bailey, a games analyst with IHS Technology. “The strength of the buzz around Fortnite means it should be able to overcome the hurdle of getting core users to download outside Google Play, but it will also need to ensure a smooth and trusted payment process.”The decision has raised concerns. There is the possibility of Android users inadvertently downloading the game from a fake site, thereby exposing themselves to malware. To access Epic’s installer, users have to switch off a function designed to protect against malicious downloads. Epic has countered by pointing out that most handsets allow users to customise which sites to give access to, and the open market approach works on PC where there are various third-party stores available. However, other publishers point out that there are already third-party stores on Android – it’s just that most users don’t visit them.“In most markets it would be brave to ignore Google Play,” said Patrik Wilkens, vice president of mobile at Spil Games. “The main disadvantage is that you make it much tougher for your game to be discovered. Amazon, Samsung and a number of other Android stores represent a fraction of the Android user base.”It be could that Epic is eyeing a lucrative new market – China – where Google Play does not operate. Having been banned until 2015, games consoles are still struggling to gain a foothold in the country, but over 580 million people play mobile games. Epic Games is partly owned by the Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent, which runs its own highly successful Android stores, giving Fortnite access to a large user-base. Tencent also published Fortnite’s close rival Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds in China, where it’s proving to be a hit.Meanwhile, there are rumours the Android Fortnite may launch as an exclusive on the forthcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 9 handset, to be announced on 9 August. “Epic will have been financially compensated for exclusivity on a platform that only represents a small share of the Android total user base,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games research at IHS Technology. “From Samsung’s perspective, they are using games to position the Note product with key audiences in markets where competition from other Android smartphone companies is escalating. “There are a cross section of ‘gamer’ smartphones already on the market targeting enthusiast gamers on mobile platforms. Mobile network operators are also positioning their offerings in the context of gaming, so aligning device marketing with this position makes sense.”The success of Fortnite, which is free to download on consoles, PC and smartphones, shows no sign of waning. Released last September, the game is estimated to have made over $1bn in revenue. Over 125 million people have now downloaded the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05b95bf562f3b889782e3d9fb0c66670b7d55c2/249_49_758_455/master/758.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6d155d7ba32bae6364b73aefa3fdc9f","title":"deepika mhatre maid turned comedian mocks india elite","story":"Deepika Mhatre has turned her experiences as a cook for rich families into a standup routineIt is considered insolent in India for a maid to talk back. But one housekeeper in Mumbai is challenging the expectation to be submissive and obedient by lampooning the world of domestic employment in a standup routine several nights a week.“Although my employers were mostly nice to me, I used to hear horror stories from other maids,” Deepika Mhatre, 43, told the . “I used my experiences for my routine, like other comedians,” she said. Mhatre’s daily routine hardly lent itself to laughs. Her day would start at 4am. From 4.30 she travelled on various commuter trains, selling imitation jewellery to passengers on their way to work in downtown Mumbai. By 7am she arrived at the first of five homes in Malad where she cooked.At 2pm she would leave for the 90-minute journey home, where she did her household chores, looked after her ailing, asthmatic husband, who has not worked for 15 years, and their three daughters, and bought and packed jewellery for the next day. At 6pm she would start cooking dinner for the family. These days, however, in the evenings she catches a train into town and performs at one of Mumbai’s comedy clubs. Standup comedy in India is in its infancy. The humour Indians enjoy in private is missing from public life and entertainment, and Bollywood’s idea of humour is slapstick. A maid doing standup comedy is unheard of.On stage, a matronly figure in a salwar kameez and dupatta – a long scarf – with her long hair tied back, she tells the audience she is special. So special that in the building where she works, she says, they have installed a special lift just for her. She pauses. In the homes where she works, they even have special plates and glasses just for her, she says.It takes a second or two before the audience understands that she is satirising the habit across India of forcing domestic staff – maids, cooks, nannies and drivers – to use separate elevators so they don’t “pollute” the lifts used by the rich residents, and to eat off separate plates. Mhatre goes on to talk about how maids have to sit on the floor, use a separate chair or stand in a corner, and she makes fun of how the rich haggle with the poor over a few measly rupees but will happily pay whatever price is marked on goods in a swanky mall.Mhatre’s sets can be seen as an attack on India’s extreme social inequality, and the inability of the rich to treat the poor as their equals. “Why do they do this? It’s because they have no heart, no feeling for poor people,” she said.Mhatre had always made her family crack up. But it was only when one of her employers, Sangeeta Vyas - who Mhatre says was much nicer than most – one day arranged a talent show for people who work as maids or drivers that Mhatre got a chance to perform. “All the other participants sang or danced. I got on stage and talked about madams. The audience liked it.” After a journalist heard about her, she was invited to perform at gigs and received encouragement from Aditi Mittal, a Mumbai comedian who has a web show called Bad Girls, which features unconventional women doing unconventional things. Her two-minute routine has gradually expanded to 10 minutes. “She can mine this madam material – their classist and superior ways – for ages because their behaviour is so ridiculous,” said Mittal.Making fun of oneself is not common in India, where blowing one’s own trumpet is more widespread, but audiences seem to appreciate her self-deprecation – despite the fact that, as Mittal says, she speaks truth to power.The gruelling routine of rising at 4am and getting home at midnight after a gig became too much for her, and two months ago she stopped her cooking work. Now it’s only the jewellery income that supports the family. “It’s tough but I don’t want to give it up. It’s the first opportunity I’ve ever had to be someone.”Given the profoundly subordinate status of maids in India, Mhatre could be forgiven for being worried about any possible repercussions, but she says firmly that “no madam can scare me”.“My struggles in life have made me strong. Appearing on stage has added to my confidence now, so no, I don’t fear any repercussions. In fact, some madams who bumped into me near the lifts spoke politely to me for the first time. Before, I had been invisible.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a53d076dacb0bdbd81ef70f4b78c410a800031/0_1389_7723_4631/master/7723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fbc190a3012e75ea20f2e83865f0541","title":"allbright networking club businesswomen male chairman allan leighton","story":"The AllBright, a recently launched London-based women’s networking club, has startled its supporters by appointing a man, Allan Leighton, as its chair. To the surprise of the club’s founders, Debbie Wosskow and Anna Jones, although not to anyone else’s, this is widely regarded as bonkers.This is a club that claims to be inspired by the first female US secretary of state, Madeleine “there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women” Albright. It has that Virginia Woolf quote (“A woman must have money and a room of her own”) by the front door, the artwork is all by women, even the wine comes from women-run vineyards. It would be fair to say that it has gone to some lengths to establish a brand as the promoter of women in business.So Leighton, despite his record as a promoter of women’s networking initiatives and his experience as chairman of the Co-operative Group, and former boss of Asda and Royal Mail, is going to send a conflicting message. Wosskow admits she is “a little bit surprised” by the reaction. But she has a defence: “There’s a very important factual point here. Allan Leighton is not the CEO of AllBright. Anna Jones and I are the co-founders of AllBright. We appointed him – and it really matters.”Wosskow’s case is that the group is operating amid the uncomfortable realities of scarce finance, where men still control the majority of startup capital, so men have to be brought on board. And on to the board, come to that. “We have raised £9m to drive the growth of the business … we’re hugely grateful to the men who have backed us to change the conversation for women,” she said on the BBC’s Today programme.Professor Jean Hartley at the Open University business school says there is a point about ersity at the top, too. “The chair’s role is to challenge and support. You want ersity in any senior team – a lot of evidence supports that. But I’m not sure about the symbolism of it.”This is an argument about ends and means: you need the money, you take the men. Or at least the man. And while an animal rights organisation, say, might be compromised if it started taking cash from big pharma on the grounds that it has to change big pharma to change the conversation for animals, it is surely harder to argue that a pro-women startup can only take money from women. On the Wosskow defence, Leighton has been taken hostage by two smart women whose steely purpose is to destroy the patriarchy he represents. But could he instead be the City equivalent of Lenin, allowed to cross imperial Germany in his sealed train in 1917 in the knowledge that the revolution he would lead would destroy the war effort of the Kaiser’s Russian enemies?It happens all the time: in June, the English Chess Federation (ECF) appointed Chris – that’s not short for Christine – Fegan as director of women’s chess. In a world where leading male players say things such as “men are hard-wired to be better at chess than women”, this seems almost as much of an own goal as AllBright’s decision to appoint Leighton, although the ECF would probably claim that at least it revived a position it had been prepared to let lapse entirely.Today’s lesson: there is a long way still to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/930247dd1a02cd95b980a7ac8c8e4411774c01fb/0_275_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b7fcccdcb28fc022f3e4c7aa174a656","title":"who let snakes out what to do find one in bed","story":"Snakes have been spotted on pavements and in parks, and some are even slithering into houses. Is the heatwave causing a mass breakout?Dave Fawbert says he wasn’t alarmed when he came across a boa constrictor on a high street in east London after popping out to buy a loaf of bread. It wasn’t moving, but the head of a pigeon was disappearing within the snake’s coils. “If it had been slithering around, I’d be more freaked out because you don’t know what it’s going to do,” says Fawbert, an editor at Shortlist, who posted a picture of the gruesome scene on Twitter on Saturday. “I wasn’t scared because it was quite obviously motionless – the bird was halfway down its throat and I thought: ‘There’s no way that snake’s going anywhere.’”A couple of other people had stopped, so he asked if anyone knew where it had come from. “No one seemed to know. It was completely without explanation.” A crowd gathered. One person prodded it. “I just said: ‘Leave it, it’s not a danger to anyone.’” Except to the pigeon, he adds. Fawbert, who had been on a snake-handling experience day earlier in the year for his birthday (“I quite like snakes”), called the RSPCA, worried that people would be scared and try to kill it.This seems to be turning into the summer of escaped snakes. Just over a week ago, a 2.4-metre (8ft) python was discovered in a man’s bathroom in Exeter after he heard toiletries and his toothbrush crashing to the floor, and went to investigate. Stuart Saunders, who is visually impaired, tried to pick up the strange tubular shape on the floor, thinking it was a piece of insulation that had fallen from somewhere, and realised it was a huge snake. He called a friend to help deal with it the python was rescued by a nearby exotic pet shop. It is thought it escaped from there and somehow made it to Saunders’ flat through the plumbing.A few days earlier, a woman in Kensington, west London, woke up to find a 1-metre (3ft) royal python curled up in bed next to her. An RSPCA officer, Jill Sanders, caught it the next evening – it had slithered off and was hiding in the flat. It was thought to be an escaped pet. “Reptiles, particularly snakes, can be extremely good escape artists and will take the opportunity of a gap in an enclosure door or a loose-fitting lid,” Sanders says.Before a race in Battersea Park, south-west London, last week, a snake, thought to be a baby boa constrictor, was found by a runner who had gone into the bushes to relieve himself. The organisers put it in a large plastic tub, says Kate Carter, the ’s life \u0026amp style editor, who was running that day. “They covered it up a bit with a hi-vis bib because someone who seemed to know about snakes thought it was exotic and could be cold, even in heatwave London. They looked after it and called the RSPCA, who came to collect it.”In May, the Manchester Evening News reported that Cordelia, a royal python – thought to be pregnant – had escaped from her home in Wythenshawe. “In the day, she just roams around my flat,” said her owner. “They are very intelligent creatures – which is what makes them good escapists as well. People have suggested Cordelia could still be in the flat somewhere, but I think she’ll have gone for a wander round.”It is still too early to say if the number of stray snakes reported this year will be higher than previous years, but they are more likely to be reported in the summer. “There are a couple of theories why this is happening,” says Nicola White, the senior scientific officer for exotics at the RSPCA. Some snakes may have escaped months ago and haven’t been as active during colder weather, “maybe lying dormant somewhere. Then as soon as the warmer weather starts, they come out because they’re more active naturally in heat. The other reason we think there may be more escapees in summer is that there are owners who like to take their snakes outside to enjoy the warmer weather. In theory, it’s a good thing to do – it’s good for an animal to get natural light, natural warmth – but we would discourage anybody from doing that without keeping the snake secure. The problem is they warm up and become quite fast, and that’s when they could escape.”What should you do if you spot a stray snake? White says you should call the RSPCA. “Our advice is always to keep a safe distance – don’t try to collect the snake yourself, or touch it. Just monitor it so we know where it is.” An officer trained in handling exotic animals will attend – for a standard-size boa constrictor, say, one person can catch it. They carry an “exotics kit”, which consists of a snake hook and a bag that can be tied at the top, and they are taught how to collect the snake safely, using the hook to control the head and gently lift it. To collect a very large snake, such as a reticulated python, which can grow to about 6.5 metres (21ft), two officers would be needed. “For one thing, they’re very heavy,” says White. If a venomous snake is on the loose, a specialist will be brought in.Some snakes will have been abandoned, particularly by people who didn’t realise what they were taking on as a pet. “Before going out and buying a reptile on a whim, we’re desperately asking people to do their research – how long is it going to live for, and how are you going to look after it properly?” But as snakes are good at escaping, “We don’t think all the ones we’re picking up have been dumped or abandoned – it’s quite likely a lot of them are escapees.” Snakes can be microchipped, but many aren’t and reuniting them with their owners is very difficult.The public are not particularly at risk, although Newman thinks our long, hot summer will mean more escapees than usual. “We pick a lot of these animals up and you can almost guarantee that if you get a phone call from someone who has found a snake in their garden, it will be the neighbour’s. It’s not an absolute rule, but almost certainly within three doors away you’ll find where it came from.”How far can they move? “They can move fast in short bursts, so they can disappear quite quickly. They’re wanderers, so they will move until they find somewhere they feel comfortable and secure. They could come from next door, find your bathroom and stay there, as long as there’s food. If there isn’t food, they will move again.” Typically, they will feed once a week, or every two or three weeks. “If there’s not any food, not any mice or anything like that, they will move. They can travel quite a long distance, there’s no limit.” A python or boa constrictor could survive outside at this time of year, but will die during the first frost. “Some of the north American snakes can survive our winters,” says Newman. “It’s not uncommon for a corn snake to escape in the autumn and be found in the spring.”Last year, sewage treatment workers in Llanllyfni, Gwynedd, found a corn snake that had escaped – down the toilet – from a house four months previously and reunited it with the owners. In Glasgow, another corn snake was discovered living in the body work of a Transit van its owner had hired to move house five months earlier – it had wriggled free from its bag and box while being transported. The snake was discovered slithering between the seats by someone else who hired the van.In July, Jake, a 1-metre kingsnake, escaped from his vivarium, probably after breaking out through a small vent. His owner, George Mole, had gone away for a few days, leaving his pet snake – one of three – digesting a frozen chick at home in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire. Jake was found a month later, about half a mile from home, after Mole put a post on a local group on Facebook. “It was a bit of a miracle. I think overjoyed is an understatement,” he says, about being reunited. Though he adds that the 14-year-old whose birthday party Jake crashed didn’t feel quite the same. The party, says Mole, “ended up in lots of screaming”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb58d7c1c60a09f50e73c051ecd5e3400581f8d/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=343335bcded22b5a4dcd83657fec9973","title":"faux rizo iceland to sell 13 vegan friendly foods including chorizo replica","story":"Frozen food retailer hopes to meet soaring UK demand from estimated 22m ‘flexitarians’ The UK’s first faux meat chorizo will go on sale in September, as part of what is claimed to be the largest single supermarket range of frozen plant-based foods. Frozen food specialist Iceland is bolstering its freezer offering with 13 new own-brand products – including vegan-friendly foods that look like chorizo sausages, chicken, burgers and mince – to meet soaring customer demand for meat substitutes. Iceland is hoping to capitalise not only on the burgeoning vegan market but also the UK’s estimated 22 million “flexitarians”, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their meat consumption.The move follows the success of its “No Bull” burgers, which are made of soya protein and coloured with beetroot extract and paprika. They were launched in April as the retailer’s first step toward an own-brand vegan range and have since outsold the retailer’s Wagyu beef versions. The new range includes a spicy jalapeño variation which the supermarket says “looks like meat, tastes like meat but simply isn’t meat”. Iceland said its “no porkies chorizo slices” have “all the smoky and spicy characteristics of your typical chorizo, without the meat”. The range also features a paella dish with “no chick chicken”.The number of vegans in the UK, who avoid all animal products including dairy and eggs, has grown fourfold in the past 10 years to about 550,000, according to the Vegan Society. Flexitarianism, which involves people increasingly choosing vegetarian and vegan options but without quitting meat and dairy produce, is also becoming more popular, with supermarkets scrambling to cater for this group. “We had tremendous success with the No Bull Burger and it’s clear our customers want more from us,” said Iceland’s head chef Neil Nugent. “In creating this range, we have embraced the nation’s love for alternative plant-based foods in an innovative and exciting way.Unlike other supermarkets like Sainsbury’s, which is selling plant-based burgers and mince alongside the real thing, Iceland will sell the new products in a dedicated “meat-free” cabinet.And in a bid to appeal to vegans, the range includes three dishes, including Asian-inspired wheat protein and tofu and vegetable burgers, which do not have the same texture as meat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68659a5732b6a11833ad642325c94276e73bfd17/1518_282_1533_920/master/1533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8f4cd3803d9bbc40ca28b883718319f","title":"beyonce reveals she is descended from a slaveowner","story":"Interview in which the singer talks about researching her ancestry also details the emergency C-section she needed for the birth of her twinsBeyoncé has said she is descended from a slaveowner, in a new interview with Vogue in which she also speaks candidly about race, body image, her children and her creativity.“I researched my ancestry recently and learned that I come from a slaveowner who fell in love with and married a slave,” she said. “I had to process that revelation over time. I questioned what it meant and tried to put it into perspective. I now believe it’s why God blessed me with my twins. Male and female energy was able to coexist and grow in my blood for the first time. I pray that I am able to break the generational curses in my family and that my children will have less complicated lives.”She said that her family has a “lineage of broken male-female relationships, abuse of power, and mistrust. Only when I saw that clearly was I able to resolve those conflicts in my own relationship” – an allusion to the marital discord between her and husband Jay-Z, who it is rumoured was unfaithful. She described him as “a soldier and such a strong support system for me” in the wake of giving birth to their twins, Rumi and Sir.She revealed that they were born via an emergency caesarian section, and that unlike after the birth of her first child Blue Ivy, she resisted pressure to follow “the things society said about how my body should look” and “embraced being curvier”.The accompanying images are by 23-year-old photographer Tyler Mitchell, who becomes the first African American to shoot a Vogue cover. “There are so many cultural and societal barriers to entry that I like to do what I can to level the playing field, to present a different point of view for people who may feel like their voices don’t matter,” the singer said. She described her Coachella performance in April, which featured much African American symbolism, as “a celebration of all the people who sacrificed more than we could ever imagine, who moved the world forward so that it could welcome a woman of colour to headline such a festival”.She added that a favourite moment on her recent tour with her husband came in Berlin:One of the most memorable moments for me on the On the Run II tour was the Berlin show at Olympiastadion, the site of the 1936 Olympics. This is a site that was used to promote the rhetoric of hate, racism, and isiveness, and it is the place where Jesse Owens won four gold medals, destroying the myth of white supremacy. Less than 90 years later, two black people performed there to a packed, sold-out stadium. When Jay and I sang our final song, we saw everyone smiling, holding hands, kissing, and full of love. To see such human growth and connection – I live for those moments.Also in collaboration with her husband, Beyoncé recently released the album Everything Is Love, as the Carters, following her six solo albums, and five with girl group Destiny’s Child."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f9877bb0b8fdfc19f0f00aa77c9999ba8a68fba/0_2_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62371065025a2fa5dfb37cafca67a183","title":"grace jones ghetts glitter the best of bestival 2018","story":"Take a look at the punters and performers who descended on Dorset’s Lulworth Estate for Bestival, including Idles, Songhoy Blues and Chaka Khan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beb50a8974a33b6109dc29ff14f0cfd359ee68fa/0_54_1868_1121/master/1868.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edf912d74d77de9ac830deb80a729b82","title":"how to spend it the shopping list for the 1 podcast","story":"In an age of astonishing wealth, nothing reveals the lives of the ultra-rich like the FT’s unashamedly ostentatious luxury magazine• Read the text version hereSubscribe via Audioboom, iTunes, Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Acast \u0026amp Sticher and join the discussion on Facebook and Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b9dc90a49ed64f6a458dbfae663cf0d84d1c692/0_59_3865_2318/master/3865.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3601828e2c57bc133ced709684c0e8d7","title":"uk schools silicon valley tech industry urged foster education revolution","story":"Education secretary wants UK and Silicon Valley firms to help put tech at heart of classroomsTech companies in the UK and abroad, including Apple and Microsoft, have been urged to help foster an education revolution by putting technology at the heart of the classroom.The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said only a minority of schools and colleges were taking advantage of opportunities to bring education to life by, for instance, enabling children to take virtual trips through the Amazon or to control robots.Technology can also slash the time teachers spend on burdensome administrative tasks, he said on Tuesday, but Hinds implored the UK’s burgeoning tech industry, along with the Silicon Valley giants, to provide support.Laws governing children\u0027s relationship with technology vary around the world, and are rarely enforced. The de facto age for many online services is 13, set by the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in 1998, which prevents sites from targeting children, or knowingly allowing children to provide information online without parental consent. The burden of garnering that consent and the low returns for building services for children has meant, however, that providers tended to turn a blind eye to under-13s on their site, neither catering for them nor expending the effort required to police against their presence.That said, tech aimed more explicitly at children has blossomed recently, and legislation that aims to protect children from potential harm have also been passed. Schoolchildren in France are barred by law from using their phones in the classroom and, from September this year, from using their phones in school at all.Such laws are countered by efforts on the part of companies such as Facebook and Google to attract new users while they’re young. Facebook offers Messenger Kids, which allows children to speak to contacts vetted by their parents, while Google’s YouTube has a Kids app that offers copious parental controls and the ability to filter videos for all but the most child-safe content – although the filters, which are run by an algorithm,\u0026nbsphaven’t always been successful, prompting the company to\u0026nbspannounce a human-curated version\u0026nbspin April.“I’ve been fortunate enough to see technology being used in revolutionary ways. Students are able to explore the rainforest, steer virtual ships or program robots from their classroom, while teachers are able to access training, share best practice with colleagues and update parents on a pupil’s progress without being taken away from their main focus – teaching,” Hinds said.“Schools, colleges and universities have the power to choose the tech tools which are best for them and their budgets. But they cannot do this alone. It’s only by forging a strong partnership between government, technology innovators and the education sector that there will be sustainable, focused solutions which will ultimately support and inspire the learners of today and tomorrow.”He identified five key areas where the sector can provide innovative solutions: teaching practices, assessment processes, teacher training and development, administration processes and lifelong learning (helping those who have left formal education to get the best from online courses).Hinds said he wanted the technology sector to demonstrate how innovations already successfully employed at some schools, colleges and universities can be rolled out more widely.A positive example cited by the Department for Education is Shireland Collegiate academy in Smethwick, where the school uses apps and software packages to facilitate its day-to-day running, saving teachers “hours and hours of time”.The DfE said it would be working closely with industry leaders as they developed online training packages and would establish an online portal providing free software trials for schools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/767de9e517942e03878eaa4318e293b904331f1e/0_55_3313_1989/master/3313.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ef0ebfce3ce80a5f5ae919a0e5870f","title":"gb win gold european swimming championships","story":"Ask those who crunch the data in the depths of British Swimming and they mention Freya Anderson with a mixture of glee and optimism.Just 17, the statuesque world junior champion is no longer one merely for the future. Her present looks pretty rosy too. And in earning in Glasgow the first senior gold medal of what many forecast will be a formidable career, few will doubt that she has the temperament to thrive in the heat of battle.Granted the concluding leg in Great Britain’s 4x100 mixed relay line-up at the European Swimming Championships, one could judge the teen favourably by the company kept. Adam Peaty, Georgia Davies and James Guy were already champions last weekend. Anderson had bronze but showed immense lustre in calmly cementing a refreshed continental record of 3 min 40.18 sec, even as the Russian anchor, Vladimir Morozov, chased her down ferociously.“I felt like I was getting hunted down by a few of the men,” she said. “But you get your head down for the team. It worked out well.”Peaty was supremely confident of victory, so much so that he eased up to save a little for 50m breaststroke. Athletes are used to compartmentalising. Hence the controversy of 24 hours before and the revelation that the world record he established in the 100m final had been increased by 0.1 sec due to faulty timing was not even a minimal distraction. “I haven’t broken it by that much but it means next time it becomes a little bit easier to break,” he said. “There is no negativity around it. I don’t think there will be an issue ratifying it at all.”James Wilby, runner-up to Peaty in his latest historic endeavour, added a second silver in the 200m breaststroke with Russia’s Anton Chupkov winning in a European record of 2:06.80, and the defending champion, Ross Murdoch, missing bronze to Italy’s Luca Pizzini by one-hundredth of a second.Alys Thomas landed bronze in the 200m butterfly, won by Hungary’s Boglarka Kapas, while there was bronze for Max Litchfield in the 200m inidual medley in a firm sign that he has recovered from a problematic shoulder injury. Elsewhere Guy and Duncan Scott progressed into Tuesday’s200m freestyle final with the latter just scraping through as the eighth qualifier.Meanwhile Katie Archibald must wait a little longer to make it a round dozen titles from the European Cycling Championships after earning silver in the omnium. The Scot was beaten by Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands, who simply had more vigour in the series of sprints at the Chris Hoy Velodrome, prevailing with 156 points to her rival’s 144 following the 20km points race.“There wasn’t much I could do,” the dethroned champion said. “I realised early on that I didn’t have the speed on Kirsten. Maybe if I’d been a bit more sensible about it but I don’t know what I could have changed tactically.“I wasn’t fast enough there and I was never going to get the space or the lap gain. Maybe I let it get in my head and I didn’t fight as much as I should have. Then there were a few moments with flipping and Kirsten sticking to my wheel, I felt I was ricocheting. I didn’t feel fantastic about that.”She will return on Tuesday for the madison in tandem with Laura Kenny and hope there is more in the tank. “It is 120 laps. Laura and I are a pretty formidable team.”Ethan Hayter and Oliver Wood took bronze in the men’s madison, courtesy of a ferocious final sprint to trail only Germany and Belgium. “Ollie just let it out before my change coming in with a lap to go,” Hayter said. “I saw we had a gap and I just paced my efforts and I knew if we could just hold that gap we would get the last sprint.”Jack Carlin missed out on a medal in the men’s sprint, beaten in the bronze race by his Dutch rival Harrie Lavreysen in the deciding leg of their best-of- three contest. “I’ve been better,” the 21-year-old Scot said.“It has been a long day. As expected it was going to be tough throughout the day and my legs just weren’t there.” Jeffrey Hoogland of the Netherlands routed Germany’s Stefan Botticher for gold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70753790e7726cb17fb86be5eae50ee6feca2477/104_64_3109_1865/master/3109.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=504f45ebd566108bcb038ff07c41d882","title":"reece prescod zharnel hughes 100m european athletic championships","story":"• Zharnel Hughes and CJ Ujah also confident of sprint victory• Asher-Smith, Miller and Yee primed for first-day medalsIf all goes to plan for Reece Prescod in Berlin tonight, he will follow in the footsteps of Jesse Owens and Usain Bolt by winning 100m gold in the Olympiastadion – and then buy a new car for his mum, who raised him as a single parent, to thank her.The 22-year-old goes into the European championships knowing that two of his team-mates, Zharnel Hughes and CJ Ujah, are also confident of victory in what could conceivably be a British one-two-three, while the Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut and Italian Filippo Tortu, who have both broken 10 seconds this season, are live dangers too.Yet Prescod, who ran a wind-assisted 9.88sec in May, says he is “pretty confident” he will win if he gets his start right. And he knows exactly what he will do with his sponsor’s bonus – reward his mum, Jennifer. “I come from a single-parent family and my mum’s looked after me throughout the years out, so my priority is to look after her,” he says.“She doesn’t have a car but she test-drove a Beetle convertible at the weekend so I feel like I can’t ignore that. I’ve got little sisters and they like Disneyland so I want to do that too.”He points to a £20 Casio watch on his wrist, then insists that the only bling he wants is a medal round his neck. “I’m not really one for frivolous things because they don’t mean anything,” he adds. “If I went to the Gucci or Louis Vuitton store and bought something, everyone would go ‘that’s cool’. But is it really cool? I’d rather just be a champion. What’s a gold chain going to do? I’m more into real stuff.”Prescod learned about Owens’ achievements at the 1936 Olympics during history class, and also recalls watching Bolt break the 100m world record in Berlin in 2009, when he was 13. “It was amazing to see it but I didn’t know what 9.58 meant because at the time I was running 11.1 or 11.2 and to me that was quite fast,” he says smiling. “9.58 is crazy. I can’t imagine what it is to be that quick.”Yet, even if Prescod emerges triumphant, he intends to keep his feet firmly on the ground. “I don’t wake up to be the best in Europe,” he says. “What drives me to train is to be world champion. I know what I am here for and I have to do it and move on.”Hughes, meanwhile, who comes into the 100m as the slight favourite, says he is proud of being called “captain” by Bolt because he is also training to become a pilot. However, the 23-year-old concedes that is difficult to come in under the radar given he has run 9.91sec this year.“But if I can go and fly a plane by myself – which my mum was terrified by – I can definitely handle the pressure,” he says. “I’ve been through a lot this season, including being shot at in Jamaica, so it has given me a strong mind-set. Every time I go and fly Bolt tells me, ‘Captain, be safe.’Hughes intends to own his own airline in the future. But he admits that his love of flying can sometimes startle people next to him on planes. “Sometimes passengers sit next to me and think, ‘What are you doing?’ as I’m pushing things forward and I’m saying, ‘This is about 80 knots, 100 knots, V1, rotate,’” he says. “One time in 2014 I was going to Oregon and the lights were dimmed because it was a night flight and I started to make the announcements. Everyone was looking around saying, ‘Why is the captain back here?’ It was funny.”Britain’s European championships got off to a bad start when the captain, Dai Greene, pulled out with a tight calf before the 400m hurdles but the team will hope for better on Tuesday. There are chances of medals beyond the men’s sprint, with Dina Asher-Smith favourite for the women’s 100m and Nick Miller ranked third in the men’s hammer.Meanwhile Alex Yee, a 20-year-old who has run the 10,000m faster than Mo Farah at the same age, has an outside shot at a medal, too. What makes Yee’s story more remarkable is that he is funded by British triathlon, and hopes to emulate the Brownlee brothers by achieving Olympic success. Yet the strength of his running has made him the sixth fastest man in Europe this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04041a95d65f1f9bd56f08a49f9f2a5079d9d16/0_160_5360_3216/master/5360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2887aa18ddb0b75d98a65ab98491e24","title":"le mow the 12 hour lawnmower race in pictures","story":"Teams compete all night in an endurance race in West Sussex in the cheapest form of motorsport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc163525fa2ac2737e0b51adb8875696e3a8c67/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c8c31aa998ca5464c290fbec7a91a68","title":"sticks and stones review roundabout summerhall edinburgh","story":"Roundabout @ Summerhall, EdinburghThe debate about what is offensive fuels Vinay Patel’s drama in which virtue signalling becomes a tangible actionChoose your words wisely. In this dystopian satire, to deviate from the politically correct rules is to initiate social and professional suicide. Fuelled by the debate about what’s offensive and who gets to determine offence, Vinay Patel’s Sticks and Stones is so much about finding the right words that language loses its meaning.B (Katherine Pearce) makes a misjudged joke and trips into a world of cultural landmines and magnified consequences, where intersectionality lessons are prescribed like a driving test refresher course for the foul-mouthed. Leaning heavily on dystopian tropes, B’s caricaturish colleagues (Charlotte O’Leary and Jack Wilkinson) live in a perpetual state of forced, grim wokeness, wearing anonymous suits and tight corporate grins. Under Stef O’Driscoll’s direction, virtue signalling becomes a tangible action. Every time an actor says a particular word, their arms wave or knees dip like exaggerated air quotations, a flash of colour and loud buzz framing the action. Together their spins, clicks and points make an elaborate dad-dance routine, but inidually they are used to accuse and degrade. When B refuses to play along with the rules, the tech desk overrides, making the Roundabout venue beep and flash until she reluctantly skews her limbs. The absence of the banned words makes the audience fill in the gaps, and allows for the debate to work for any social issue, on either side of the political spectrum. But this lack of context means the play can never go deeper than broad generalities. The direction becomes a little wearisome too. The novel appeal of the verbal disco wears off quickly, and while O’Leary’s full-bodied cringe gets a big laugh, the joke becomes overwrought.Patel doesn’t come down too harshly on either side. Rather, he picks on the reluctance to learn. Pointing to our resistance to explanation and acceptance, Sticks and Stones acknowledges the difficulty in keeping up when cultural sensitivities seem so quick to alter, as well as the frustration in the face of those unwilling to try. Let’s start talking to each other, the play begs, before our words start slapping us across the face."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/638d1498fb91edf16bc8f6bd1be7d18aabac3405/0_276_4200_2519/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be89b56edcea4fcd80da3f12567f66b9","title":"pride and prejudice the americans who fly the confederate flag","story":"A listening tour in Mississippi asks flag supporters why they still support a symbol that represents pain, ision and difficult historyby  Donna Ladd with pictures by Kate MedleyIt was 1957 when little Lindy Luby’s great-uncle showed up at her house near Benton, Mississippi, where the family had lived for generations. He was a justice of the peace in Yazoo City, the gateway to the fertile, brutal lands of the Delta.“Effie, it’s just been a bad day,” the lawman said to his sister, as the six-year-old listened. “I just had to go cut a black boy down off that hanging tree and take him to his mama.”The infamous tree, used for lynching, was bending over a bridge on Highway 433 toward Lexington.“What did he do?” Effie Luby asked.“He raped and killed a white woman.”Lindy, now 66, has shifted her stance on the death penalty. After she sat on a jury that condemned a man to death, she now campaigns for alternatives to execution and stars in a new documentary about her experience.The first cut of the film also showed Lindy and husband, Ira Isonhood, flying the Confederate battle flag on a 20ft pole in the backyard of one of their homes.To many white people in the south and beyond, the Confederate flag is a sign of historic pride and defiance to whatever is currently called “liberalism” to most black Americans, the flag stands for white supremacy and racial violence. Today, the symbol often appears at “pro-white” rallies and is a lightning rod in America’s calcifying racial ides.The flag’s history is fraught and complicated, as was the bloody civil war that erupted in 1861 between the US south – where America’s slave trade had relocated and expanded by the mid-1800s – and the north. After the north won, it imposed a harsh Reconstruction on the south that still fuels white resentment today.The post-war white south embraced the Confederate battle flag, making it their sentimental symbol of the “lost cause” of the war. By the time Mississippi embedded it into its new state flag in 1894, the flag was used to both honor the Confederate dead as well as a romanticized version of the war’s purpose.By the mid-20th century, the flag symbolized white resistance to ending segregation laws. The Ku Klux Klan flew it at lynching parties and angry mobs waved it outside public schools as black children enrolled in front of white “segregation academies” and next to leering dogs unleashed on black protesters wanting the right to vote. (Today, its supporters say the KKK co-opted it.) In April 2001, Mississippians voted along race lines to keep the flag as it was. The debate reignited in 2015 after Dylann Roof killed nine black people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. A photo soon emerged of him holding a Confederate flag. The matter is especially raw in Mississippi, a state that suffered tremendous Confederate casualties and went from being the richest state from slavery before the civil war to one of the poorest.The Isonhoods were the first stop of my May 2018 listening tour of Mississippi with photographer Kate Medley to ask flag supporters in our home state why they still support a symbol that represents so much pain, ision and difficult history – even as they urge black Americans to get over their resistance to it.Ira Isonhood, 71, remembers his father inviting black people to sit in his yard to watch a basketball game through the window when he got the area’s first television – a progressive move in the mid-20th century south. But he was still a product of his time.One day, a black boy came to his dad’s store with a shopping list his mother had signed with “Mrs”. His father sent a note back with no groceries. When her husband came later, the storekeeper admonished him in front of young Ira. “Don’t ever allow your wife to sign ‘Mrs’ again!” he warned.Still, Ira flies the flag, which his own high school and college used as an emblem.“The Confederate flag played a big, big part in our history,” Ira says. “… Why are these minorities pushing to do away with this flag? Look at what’s happening to our statues!” he says.Neither Ira nor Lindy has asked black acquaintances why the flag is offensive, or asked why many believe it belongs in museums, but not part of a state emblem. “I don’t think the black people around here care,” Lindy says.She wonders why the flag is once again becoming a big deal. “Is it their feelings? … Mississippi has bent over backwards to say I’m sorry. How much more do we need to do?”I later relay Lindy’s questions to Genesis Be, a 31-year-old hip-hop artist, public speaker and anti-Confederate flag activist from Biloxi. I met Be after reporting that her grandfather, Pastor Clyde Briggs, was a target of the Klan in the 1960s for trying to organize and arm black people against white supremacy. I have stuck my finger into a bullet hole in her family home where the Klan fired into the wall above where her aunt, then a child, slept.“What has Mississippi done to say that it is sorry for the rape, torturing and killings of scores of its black citizens in order to create a white majority?” Be says. “Open a museum?”“I’ve never heard of an apology from the Klan in Franklin County for harassing and assaulting my family while flying that flag. All I’ve heard is a downplaying and whitewashing of history in an attempt to gaslight its population.”Ongoing inequities, Be reminds, are bolstered by a kinder, gentler version of Confederate history rewritten after the south lost the civil war and its rights to maintain and extend slavery.After driving north along the lonely stretch of Highway 49 through Delta plantation lands, we end up in Larry McCluney Jr’s attic in Greenwood.The room is a shrine to the Confederacy with a rebel-flag-themed cushion, curtains and even a mousepad. There’s also a civil war chess set. The closet is packed with battle re-enactment costumes and weapon replicas.McCluney, 53, is a national officer in the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which accepts male descendants of southern soldiers. SCV was created in 1896 for the “vindication of the cause for which we fought” and to ensure “that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved.” SCV members worked with the United Confederate Veterans and other groups in the early 20th century to demand school textbooks supporting the revisionist view that the south fought for a just “lost cause” that was decidedly not slavery. McCluney has taught history and government for 25 years to mostly black Delta students.“People like me … it’s in our blood. We know about our family, their sacrifices,” he says of his 20 ancestors who fought for the Confederacy.“Slavery was an issue, but not the cause,” the teacher tells me. He repeats SCV’s selective semantics with precision: the south seceded over “states’ rights” to financial independence the north and Abraham Lincoln weren’t against slavery at the outset northern tariffs were killing the south few southerners and soldiers owned humans slavery was fading anyway and it wasn’t about white supremacy.The facts are more complicated. Despite decades of efforts to renovate history, Mississippi’s Declaration of Secession still begins by clarifying that the state left the union in 1861 for a cause “thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery,” adding for posterity that “none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun” that enables cotton to flourish.By 1861, the south was demanding slavery expansion into western territories, which Lincoln’s “Black Republicans” adamantly opposed. The SCV is correct, though, that Lincoln did not initially call for emancipation. In fact, Frederick Douglass called Lincoln “preeminently the white man’s president, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men.”In his attic, McCluney downplays slavery ownership – saying “elite” planters, not soldiers, owned most slaves. “Most (southerners) did not have a dog in the hunt,” he says. But slavery was waning, McCluney insists, and the north should have let it fade naturally. After I mention that Mississippi outlawed freeing slaves in 1857, he said that the south wouldn’t have seceded if the federal government had allowed (white, male) voters to decide slavery per state or territory.McCluney teaches his black students his Confederate history. “I try to be sensitive. I’m a pointblank person. Don’t ask if you don’t want to know.” But, he adds, “they know me as a teacher who cares about them”.The educator points to Roof’s “horrible, horrible” 2015 massacre of black worshippers – and his viral photo holding the Confederate flag – as inciting a war on the emblem. “Politically correct groups seized that opportunity to make it seem like that flag came down that pole, walked down into that church and killed those people,” he says. “… That was horrific to my organization (SCV) when that took place.”I later share those words with Derrick Johnson, the national president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who previously led the Mississippi chapter.“Wow,” he says, then pauses.Then Johnson turns to Roof: “All of the views and racial hatred symbols that informed his opinion walked into that church with him. He’s more than enough reason that the symbols of the Confederacy should be removed from the public square.”Thomasa Massey, 49, jumps out of her car at Pearl Park in a majority-white Jackson suburb wearing a T-shirt with Confederate butterflies she designed with “Pride, Not Prejudice” underneath.When I had interviewed her about being in a white gang, I saw her defending the flag on Facebook. Her friend Evangela Hentz, who is black, opens the passenger door, and we all run through the rain to a pavilion. The two single mothers finish each other’s sentences, laughing about that time Hentz went into labor where they worked and Massey put her in an office chair to wheel her downstairs to go to the hospital. “I have struggled. She’s helped me. She’s struggled. I’ve been there for her,” Massey, the child’s godmother, says.“We just didn’t believe in racism. Nobody, my whole town,” she says.The Confederate flag represents pride in the face of poverty to Massey, who came to Mississippi in 2001, the same year voters decided against changing the state flag. She supports Mississippians’ right to keep it as is. “It was there when our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, were struggling to feed their six, eight, 10 kids. It flew for all colors, black, white, whatever,” she says.Hentz, 41, is from Missouri, once a violent slave state, but calls the flag just an “inanimate object,” adding: “Stop letting it control you.”“If you don’t breathe life into something, it will die,” Massey adds.The friends reject being offended over what Hentz calls “just a piece of cloth”.Be, who discusses the flag respectfully with friends who like it, challenges Massey, Hentz and others to probe deeper.“It was poor white southerners who fought in these battles, being strung along by rich, property-owning whites who banked on the ignorance and arrogance of the poor whites to fight and die in the war,” Be says.“They gave their life, but for what?”Gentlemanly Kevin Davis is surprised when we show up at his large white antebellum-style house in Simpson County. We are stopping by homes with flags, but owners keep pointing us on down the road to him.Davis – no relation to Jeff – has taught history in public and private schools, and also turned out to be an SCV member. Thirteen of his ancestors fought for the south, but most didn’t own slaves. Three died in battle, and one in a makeshift hospital in the Lyceum at Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi – one of numerous buildings built by slaves.“To me, the flag is not a racist thing. It’s a piece of our heritage that should be left there to honor sacrifices,” Davis says in a cozy parlor, adding that most soldiers were “dirt-poor farmers” with no slaves. Davis, 47, also believes the institution might have died out due to “modernization … if they were able to compromise another 20 years. That’s what state’s rights were about: protecting slavery,” he says. “… There would not have been a war over tariffs.”Most Confederacy fans may cherry-pick their side’s history, but many are more precise about the chinks in the Yankees’ armor – including that not everyone up north was hip to slavery ending, either.And, as McCluney points out, New York-financed slave ships kept sailing to West Africa for people to be sold in the Caribbean and South America.Davis is circumspect on the complicated history: “I can say it was wrong, and I hope I wouldn’t have participated in (slavery), but how can we know for sure?”Still, Davis balks at the need to exorcise the emblem from the state flag today out of respect to Mississippians who descended from slaves. His own ancestors’ sacrifice is paramount. “It’s so we don’t forget,” he says.The history teacher could handle it if the state flag changed, though. “I would be sad about it, not violently upset. I would not be up around the last flag making a chain gang to keep somebody from taking it down,” Davis says.We’re on Highway 49 south when it pops up: Flag Heads, which sells “adult novelties” and Confederate tchotchkes.“You won’t find it at Wal*Mart,” a large sign proclaims, reminding shoppers that the retailer dropped Confederate merchandise within a week of Roof’s massacre.If you can put a rebel flag on it, they do: beach towels, BBQ aprons, windshield dice, coasters, flip-flops, polar fleeces, bikinis, umbrellas and more. Pipes fill a glass case, and we avoid the curtained adult room.Petite Roslyn Stuart is behind the counter with a swagger like she has seen it all more than once. She immediately brings up Roof.“Until that kid went in that church in Charleston, people never thought anything about the Confederate or Mississippi flag,” she says. “… The flag not gon’ change the hate.”Stuart blames detractors. “It’s not us that’s racial it’s them that’s racial. Most of ’em don’t know what it means,” she says. “It’s a symbol of our state it’s who we are.”She continues: “Northern people were down here trying to burn all our stuff” – true the Yankees torched Jackson three times – “and we were trying to stop them … They didn’t think it was right we had slaves. It turned into one big heckuva mess. It’s lingering still out there.”She worries that young people now think the flag stands for the KKK. “Eventually, they will take the state flag they will change it. What’s next? The Christian flag?” she asks.A black FedEx man wouldn’t come through the front door, she says, instead leaving heavy packages on the porch because “he thinks we’re racial”. So she asked for a new driver and got one.“Come on over!” Joe Barnes booms, describing his nearby Seminary home as the one with the US, Confederate and Mississippi flags out front, after I tell him Roslyn sent us.Barnes, 66, beams as he hands us his SCV card with Nathan Bedford Forrest, the wealthy Memphis slave trader and first KKK grand wizard, pictured on the front.Retired military, Barnes used to attend all the Ole Miss college football games, but he now watches on TV. He wrote the chancellor that he would never buy another ticket after the game ban of the rebel flag.“Our ancestors fought under that flag,” Barnes says. “It’s not about hatred.” He adds that blacks fought for the south, too. (True, but usually for their masters. Many defected to segregated union camps.)“Schools are not teaching history the right way,” he says. “… It’s not whites that are the racists it’s mostly the blacks … What it boils down to is black people are just trying to overrule us.”“If we can’t get white people to stand together, it’s going to be another civil war,” he adds.Barnes has black friends, he says, and points out that African Americans use the N-word. “White folks can be that, too. There are trashy white people and trashy black people.”SCV is not racist or violent, he says. “The Klan is different from us. The SCV might fly the flag, but we don’t associate with them. We’re not a violent organization. We try to help people.”Johnson, CEO of the NAACP, says he wishes poor whites would recognize how powerful politicians have long played racial politics with Confederate emblems – a deliberate strategy to ide them from people with shared economic interests.“The very same people that exploit the working class for cheap labor and create systems to undermine their development through poor education systems use issues of racial ision to maintain economic control,” the NAACP president says.The flag could easily be honored or studied in museums, he adds.“The NAACP respects the constitutional, first amendment right for private citizens to maintain symbols and monuments on private property,” he says. “Enjoy.”“Can you tell me why?”On the last day, I again sit with Lindy Isonhood, this time at Deer Hollow, their other home farther south where Ira’s Confederate man cave, as Kate is calling the rooms we’ve seen, is packed with deer antlers, a boar’s head trophy, and little rebel flags. Ira is in the backyard posing for pictures in front of his Confederate flag.Lindy has thought about our first conversation overnight and wants to understand why I do not support the flag.“The war really was about slavery, and they didn’t hide it then,” I say as she listens intently. “But I don’t believe everyone who likes the flag is racist.

It is understood members had a forum to discuss whether the position of the Burton and Uttoxeter MP was tenable. However, no decision on his future was made and no votes were cast. One party member told the  that Mike Wood, the Conservative MP for Dudley South, spoke on behalf of Griffiths. However, members were told there would not be a decision on his future until the outcome of an independent investigation being carried out by Conservative Campaign Headquarters.Griffiths, the prime minister’s former chief of staff who resigned as a minister after sending hundreds of sexually explicit messages to two women, has also been accused of having bullied a council leader for several years when May took office in July 2016.The 47-year-old stood down as minister for small business last month after it emerged he had sent more than 2,000 texts, many of them sexually aggressive, to two bar workers more than 20 years his junior. revealed that Griffiths was promoted to minister for small business in January despite being under investigation over allegations of inappropriate touching and bullying by Deneice Florence-Jukes, a former Tory borough councillor, who had filed a formal complaint three months earlier.Thousands of people signed a petition calling for Griffiths to step down and last week about 100 people attended a protest calling for his resignation. Many in his own party have refused to publicly back him as concerns about his past conduct have become public.A statement was due to be released by East Staffordshire Conservative association after the meeting at the Pirelli Stadium in Burton. It is thought central Conservative officials talked members through the party’s disciplinary procedure.Council leader Richard Grosvenor told the Burton Mail before the meeting: “I am not sure we can take any action this evening. I am not sure there is an appetite from some members to take any action.”Another councillor, Mick Bowering, said: “I am not a fan of his behaviour. I want to learn about what is being said at the meeting before I can say anything. I certainly do hope he will attend.”Gary Raybould, a Tory candidate for Tutbury, said: “It is a shame because the man has done a lot of work in the town and unfortunately, when you live life in the public sector, you live that role. You take the positives and the negatives.”Griffiths is suspended from the Conservative party pending the investigation but remains an MP. He previously said he was due to “seek professional treatment” after his messages were exposed in the Sunday Mirror on 15 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37eb14c2584b465cc650de3b4f273d1118e66603/0_697_1606_963/master/1606.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138577a2cd72a32215c5a56cee475754","title":"italy tanker truck explodes on motorway near bologna airport","story":"At least two killed and dozens injured in Italy after blast spreads fire and debrisAt least two people have been killed and more than 60 others injured after two trucks collided on a motorway near Bologna airport in northern Italy.A lorry carrying cars collided on a bridge with a tanker lorry containing flammable materials, local reports said.The blast, which engulfed the area with flames and black smoke and caused a bridge to partially collapse, occurred near Borgo Panigale to the west of the city, the Italian fire service tweeted.Italian media reported that many of the injured were hit by debris and glass after the explosion.Firefighters have since extinguished the blaze, a spokesman said, adding that efforts were under way to ascertain the cause of the explosion and the number of victims.A video published on Twitter by the fire service showed a huge column of black smoke billowing from the wreckage of the truck on the city’s ring road.Images released earlier by the fire service showed burning cars in an adjacent car park."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48353bf51ea1da42870d6a4e5357ba6c545cf7d0/0_67_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71e910f19984b8890dd48e3a959ce76b","title":"north korea frustrates us maximum pressure eases sanctions","story":"Pyongyang appears to be evading curbs with help of lax approach by China and RussiaWithout the spectre of imminent nuclear war, there is not much appetite for strict enforcement of international sanctions aimed at forcing North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programmes.There is a mounting body of evidence that Pyongyang is evading the restrictions with a combination of subterfuge and lax enforcement by China and Russia, its closest allies, rendering the US plan of “maximum pressure” increasingly ineffective.In two high-profile and historic meetings this year, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, agreed to “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, but has done little to curb weapons development. The US has demanded Kim give up his nukes before any sanctions are lifted.North Korea has used a variety of means to sidestep the restrictions. Ship-to-ship transfers of oil and coal in the dead of night have been repeatedly documented, North Korean labourers work openly in China and Russia, and Pyongyang continues to work with Syria’s military.“Kim Jong-un is playing a very logical game. He’s getting weaker sanctions enforcement from China and Russia while engaging the United States on his terms,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy.“If it’s possible to weaken the resolve of China and other members of the international community to impose and enforce sanctions, that’s certainly in North Korea’s interest. But North Korea isn’t so committed to that goal that it would give up its nuclear programme.”More than 10,000 North Korean workers have registered to work in Russia since September, with at least 700 obtaining work permits this year, in potential violation of UN sanctions, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. US officials estimate North Koreans working in Russia send as much as $300m (£230m) a year to Pyongyang, a critical source of foreign currency.In a sign of growing frustration, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, publicly warned Russia and China last week against weakening sanctions enforcement during a trip to Singapore.His plea came as a panel of UN experts tasked with monitoring sanctions implementations said Pyongyang had continued its nuclear and missiles programmes, and documented a host of violations including attempts to sell weapons to armed groups in Yemen and exporting more than $100m in textiles over a six-month period.North Korea “has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes and continued to defy security council resolutions through a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, as well as through transfers of coal at sea during 2018”, the report said, according to a Reuters report.North Korean coal has even turned up at South Korean ports, which has long had a ban on products from the North.Amid the growing list of apparent sanctions violations, North Korea’s state-controlled media has begun calling for the US to drop the restrictions, saying its moratorium on missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of its only known nuclear test site and the return of Korean war dead was enough.“There have been outrageous arguments coming out of the US state department that it won’t ease sanctions until a denuclearisation is completed, and reinforcing sanctions is a way to raise its negotiating power,” the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, a ruling Workers’ party mouthpiece, said in a front-page editorial. “How could the sanctions, which were a stick the US administration had brandished as part of its hostile policy against us, promote the two countries’ amity?”Several other North Korean outlets also criticised the pressure campaign as “anachronistic” and an obstacle to better relations. The complaints may be a sign sanctions are still a significant hurdle to trade or could merely be a negotiating tactic.“Maximum pressure has lost all steam,” added Jackson, now a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington. “One of the perverse consequences of the nuclear crisis last year was that nobody wanted a return to that precarious situation, and virtually everyone was willing to accept any outcome that assured we didn’t return to the brink of a nuclear war.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da1f53e838cc8b9f41014cf7f2196637293efcf7/0_314_5551_3331/master/5551.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c24516b6c7cbabce175190ec8f63b71","title":"the gru the russian intelligence agency behind the headlines","story":"Accusations mount against the Russia army’s main intelligence directorateIn Russia’s shadow war with the west, one intelligence agency keeps making headlines.The GRU, or main intelligence directorate, of the Russian army, has been accused of spearheading several of Russia’s most notorious operations in recent years. They include the 2014 seizure of Crimea using undercover soldiers called “little green men”, the hacking theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton, and even the planning of a failed coup in Montenegro. A British security source told the  on Monday that the nerve agent attack on the former double agent Sergei Skripal was also ordered by the intelligence agency. The British government is poised to submit an extradition request to Moscow for two Russians suspected of carrying out the Salisbury attack that left one person dead and three injured, including Skripal and his daughter.One of the three main Russian intelligence agencies, less has been written about the GRU (now officially called the GU, or Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces) than its sister agencies, particularly the Soviet-era KGB or its modern successor the FSB, the spy agency once headed by Vladimir Putin.Known for operating under a wartime mentality and a willingness to take risks, experts say the culture of the GRU has been influenced by its inclusion of Spetsnaz special forces and experience in war zones, including Syria and Ukraine.“The GRU regards itself as a war-fighting instrument. Yes, it gathers conventional intelligence … but its culture is much more military,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security issues and the country’s intelligence agencies. “Although only a minority of GRU officers are Spetsnaz, it has an impact when part of your service are commandos.”Besides special forces, the spy agency manages more traditional intelligence-gathering operations around the world, as well as signals intelligence. Vladimir Rezun, a GRU officer who defected to the UK in the 1970s, wrote in his history of the agency (written under the pen name Viktor Suvorov) that it was largely tasked with preventing the collapse of the Soviet Union from without, as opposed to the KGB, which had a prominent role in thwarting internal threats.While the KGB became notorious, the GRU largely operated in obscurity. “In the people’s consciousness, everything that is dark, underground and secret is connected with the KGB but not at all with the GRU,” he wrote.Traditionally, Galeotti noted, the GRU answered for “uncontrolled spaces”. While in the past that has meant areas like civil wars, it may also apply to zones like cyberspace now. Several Russian intelligence agencies were involved in hacking operations before the 2016 US presidential elections, but only the GRU was identified in an 11-count indictment released last month by the United States special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The hack was perpetrated by staff employees of several Moscow-based units traditionally tied to signal intelligence. The interests of Russia’s intelligence agencies regularly overlap, as have their methods. As Christopher Andrew wrote in The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West, his study of notes on KGB files smuggled out of Russia, the agency “offered its allies lethal nerve toxins and poisons which were fatal on contact with the skin for use during ‘special actions’”.While the GRU has largely been shrouded in secrecy, there have been occasional contacts with the west. Peter Zwack, a retired US army brigadier general, wrote about a series of meetings before the Sochi Olympics with the head of the GRU, Igor Sergun, who died unexpectedly of a heart attack in January 2016. “I found him soft-spoken, unassuming, complex, erudite and nuanced,” he said of their meetings, which largely focused on counter-terrorism efforts. “I learned that even as Sergun relentlessly directed global intelligence operations against our interests, he — paradoxically — also viewed constant confrontation with the US and west as not in Russia’s best long-term interest,” Zwack wrote.Those meetings ended after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyBloombergWe have been getting a large volume of complaints about Aer Lingus in recent weeks. There is a common thread running through them all. Passengers are saying they are finding it next to impossible to make contact with the company when things go wrong.This story from John Murphy is illustrative of the problem. “Last year, while visiting my daughter in Chicago with my wife and younger daughter I received a text from Aer Lingus a few days before the holiday was due to end to say my scheduled flight from Chicago to Dublin was cancelled,” he says.There was no one in the US who was able to provide him and his family with any information as to why the flight was cancelled. “In frustration, I rang their reservations service in Ireland and was told it was for the old catch-all ‘technical issues’.”While Murphy lives in Ireland, he had to be in work in Nottingham the following week and was “anxious to ensure that I got us seats on a flight that would get me home in time”.He echoes concerns from other readers that the airline is “virtually impossible to get in touch with, so despite many attempts I went online and rebooked onto a flight that was a day earlier. This resulted in losing a night’s accommodation, a day’s car-hire and the cost of rebooking three seats beside each other on the plane,” Murphy writes. “I also lost a day’s holiday time with my daughter in the US.”When he got home he went through “due process to try and claim compensation. I scanned all the relevant documents and sent them to Aer Lingus ‘guest relations’ and received a reply acknowledging receipt of my claim and that they were very busy and to be patient,” his mail continues. He says the mail told him “not to contact them again as this would cause confusion and they might duplicate the case”.Murphy follows Aer Lingus on Twitter and decided he would give that a go in June of this year. “I contacted them via Twitter and they got back in touch to say that they had asked for my case to be escalated. Still no response from ‘guest relations’. I was going to contact you in August of this year as it is the one-year anniversary of my case being acknowledged,” he writes. But he saw the article we had last week about other passengers who were left hanging by the airline,\u0026nbsp“and thought now would be an appropriate time”.In conclusion, he says he flies twice a week to the UK “generally with Ryanair but have continued to use Aer Lingus and will fly to the US with them later this year as I believe their product is good. Unfortunately, their complaints department is awful and there are probably lots more like me that have experienced this less-than-satisfactory service.”We contacted the airline and received the following statement: “We offer our sincerest apologies to your reader and accept that how we handled this case was wholly unacceptable. The delay in handling the complaint was due an issue of human error which caused it to go unattended. Our Guest Relations team has made contact with your reader to arrange the compensation due to them and to refund expenses incurred. We apologise once again and wish to reassure your readers this is not the level of service Aer Lingus seeks to deliver to our guests.”If you have struggled to make contact with Aer Lingus or have been left waiting a very long time for their fabled “guest relations” department to get back to you then we would like to hear from you.A woman from Dublin contacted us last week after receiving a phone call from a person claiming to be from Microsoft and warning her that her computer had been infected with malicious software which would require a payment of €10 to be put right.She rightly suspected this to be a scam and she wondered if we could do something to alert people to it. The Microsoft scam preys on vulnerable people and while it was at its height five years ago, when almost one in four Irish people reported getting a telephone call from scam artists posing as computer security engineers with Microsoft, it hasn’t gone away.The call warns recipients they are at risk of a computer security threat. Once a victim is duped into believing there is a real problem, the scam artists run through a range of deception techniques designed to thieve money.“Tech-support scams are an industry-wide issue where scammers use scare tactics to trick you into paying for unnecessary technical support services that supposedly fix contrived device, platform, or software problems,” Microsoft says.“Scammers may call you directly on your phone and pretend to be representatives of a software company. They might even spoof the caller ID so that it displays a legitimate support phone number from a trusted company. They can then ask you to install applications that give them remote access to your device. Using remote access, these experienced scammers can misrepresent normal system output as signs of problems.“Scammers might also initiate contact by displaying fake error messages on websites you visit, displaying support numbers and enticing you to call. They can also put your browser on full screen and display pop-up messages that won’t go away, essentially locking your browser. These fake error messages aim to trick you into calling an indicated technical support hotline. Note that Microsoft error and warning messages never include phone numbers.”The key thing to remember is that if you ever receive an unsolicited email message or phone call that purports to be from Microsoft or another company asking that you to send personal information or click links, ignore or report the email, or hang up the phone."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Vaccinations suggested by health body amid fears mass gathering may pose infection riskConcern Co Louth structure will not cope with extra garda\u0026iacute hard Brexit might entailSinn F\u0026eacutein ex-president tells festival recipes are peace process\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobest-kept secrets\u0026rsquoFormer president hopeful pontiff will change church doctrine on homosexualityTipping point would pose \u0026lsquosevere risks for health, economies, political stability\u0026rsquoWinning goal scored by captain Gary Messett just two months after father\u0026rsquos murderThe \u0026lsquogood news story\u0026rsquo surrounding the programme \u0026lsquohas been somewhat lost\u0026rsquoKeyleigh Loren had been missing from her home in KildanganSenior Helpline urges members of the public to look out for older people who cannot travelTeam greeted with a joyous and emotional homecoming as sights now set on Olympics\u0026lsquoDoomsday Clock now stands at two minutes to midnight,\u0026rsquo Irish CND president saysStraw creation of Pontiff in his popemobile is star of the annual show in Co LaoisTears as Minister for Sport announces \u0026euro1.5 million in extra funding for teams preparing for the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020Carl Reilly from west Belfast accused of directing activities of terrorist organisationNew measure to allow Patrick Street operate as afternoon bus corridor will take time to bed in, caution Cork Business AssociationGarda\u0026iacute believe car was being driven wrong way down northbound lane at PortlaoiseByproduct could be valuable resource as material used in place of sand and gravelHospital says State may have to triple salary level to recruit leading obstetricians if it removes private practice from public hospitals"},{"url":null,"title":"a day of celebration and singing as women s hockey team are welcomed home","story":"  August 6, 2018Tears as Minister for Sport announces \u0026euro1.5 million in extra funding for teams preparing for the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020   August 6, 2018Team greeted with a joyous and emotional homecoming as sights now set on Olympics "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587943.1533575927!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands welcome irish hockey team home after world cup successes","story":"Members of the Irish women\u0027s hockey team that won silver in the weekend’s World Cup Final celebrate their return to Ireland with a lot of singing and dancing.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneTHE IRISH TIMESIf only Sunday’s World Cup final had been a singing competition and not a hockey match, the medals brought home by the Irish team would have been gold and not silver.The Irish women danced the conga and began singing as they boarded the plane for home following Sunday’s final defeat to the Netherlands which they lost 6-0.They didn’t stop when they reached Dublin Airport, nor on the bus into the city centre. By the time the public homecoming moved to Dame Street, there were a few voices frayed at the edges, but they carried on regardless.This was a joyous and at times, emotional, homecoming. At Dublin Airport many members of the squad cried when the Minister for Sport Shane Ross announced there would be a further €1.5 million funding for Irish teams preparing for the 2020 Toyko Olympics, a substantial portion of which will go to Irish hockey.Perhaps, the realisation that public thanks went beyond mere platitudes provoked the tears.They will hold Mr Ross to that promise, though Ireland’s star performer at the championship, goalkeeper Ayeisha McFerran (22), opined that it was the least they deserved.“We have been asking him for a while for far more funding so that we can get on to that platform that we know we can achieve,” she said.A crowd estimated at 5,000 turned out to greet the squad in Dame Street. It consisted mostly of young girls and judging by the numbers who cheered when they were asked if they were members of a club, this was predominantly a gathering of the hockey clans.Proud father and former Ireland rugby international Phillip Matthews, whose daughter Hannah was one of the stalwart Irish performers, enumerated all the ways in which the team surpassed their expectations. “It’s much easier playing that watching it as a spectator let me tell you,” he said. “I’m so proud of all of them.”Host Des Cahill confessed, that like most of the rest of us, he knew little about hockey before the World Cup tournament in London started, but he did understand one incontrovertible fact: “Irish people love medals. The country fell in love with you.”Each of the 18 squad members were introduced to the crowd. All had a story to tell. Substitute goalkeeper Grace O’Flanagan is a qualified doctor who often turned up for training in her scrubs after a 24 hour shift.Midfielder Lizzie Colvin is getting married in October and invited all 17 squad members as bridesmaids. “It’s too late to take it back now,” she joked.Emily Beatty had glitter in her handbag and was getting ready to cheer on her teammates when she got the call on Sunday morning, five hours before the game, to play in the World Cup final, as you do.“I got a taxi and said, ‘it’s an emergency, I’m playing in the World Cup final’,” she said.She replaced Megan Frazer who who had her own tale of woe relating to a series of injuries s to make the tournament.The homecoming in Dublin ended with a few showstoppers. The squad’s piece is All I Want for Christmas Is You. A Christmas song in the middle of summer, you might ask? Then again a team which reached the World Cup final despite being the second lowest ranked team is capable of anything.Captain Katie Mullen rated their rendition of the Mariah Carey standard on the morning of the World Cup final as the stand-out moment of their week.“It has been a bit of a tradition that the night before a game was like Christmas Eve and then the game itself was like Christmas morning,” she explained.It may explain why the Irish team played with such joy and without fear throughout the tournament.They squad’s unofficial anthem is the Lighthouse Family’s High which closed the homecoming. Arm in arm and hand in hand they swayed to the music and the crowd swayed along with them.What highs can surpass this? “We’ll get to the Olympics,” said coach Graham Shaw.To that end, the extra money will come in handy. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport stressed\u0026nbspthe €1.5 million was not drawn from pre-existing commitments but instead was part of a larger “windfall” of money given to the department that will be allocated to other areas under Mr Ross’s remit.\u0026nbspA spokesman said the €1.5 million would go towards high performance sports in preparation for the 2020 Olympics, but the exact proportion that will be given to women’s hockey has yet to be decided.However, as Shaw pointed out, the disparity of resources remains massive. He revealed that one of the other teams in the World Cup had a budget of €17 million. That’s what this Irish team continues to be up against."},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Women more likely to survive heart attack if treated by female doctors Universities’ main purpose is no longer learning, minister says as he calls for mental health focusDeath of the phrase book and rise of smartphone translation apps leads to holiday faux pas, British Council sayThink tank says it\u0026#39s \u0026#39hard to believe\u0026#39 ministers are talking about a no-deal BrexitRick Gates testifies he committed crimes with Trump\u0026#39s former campaign manager Paul ManafortCar thief killed retired nurse in 147mph hit-and-run when he crashed stolen Mercedes on 60mph roadBBC Panorama accidentally revealed young boy\u0026#39s name during investigation into abuse in jailsBarry Chuckle was fighting secret bone cancer battle when he died, brother revealsEleven children in US rescued from \u0026#39extremists\u0026#39 at \u0026#39filthy\u0026#39 hideoutWarmer than average autumn expected after UK summer heatwave Comment: Building on the green belt won\u0026#39t solve the affordable housing crisis – let\u0026#39s abolish stamp duty insteadComment: Trump\u0026#39s hard line on Iran sanctions threatens western unitySaving Poundstretcher, episode 1, review: shabby shop floors are not the answer to the failing of this businessVictims of \u0026#39phantom tyre slasher\u0026#39 feel let down by police as blunders see case thrown outFormer  journalist Bernadette McNulty drowned during late night swim in Oman, inquest hearsParents must accompany children to collect exam results, Good Schools Guide director saysSurrey Police apologise after judgment reveals disclosure failings in Jonathan King sex abuse case‘Isil Beatles’ question UK plan for US trial without death penalty assurancesInstagram and Tumblr allowing \u0026#39extremely dangerous\u0026#39 self harm images that could lead to teenagers copying behaviour, NSPCC warnsPresident of Calais region furious over \u0026#39scandalous\u0026#39 move to cut out French ports from post-Brexit trade route Royal Institute of British Architects in \u0026#39racism row\u0026#39 and issues \u0026#39gagging order\u0026#39 to presidential candidateWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

brexit","story":"Liam Fox said a no-deal Brexit was now a 60-40 chanceEconomic experts have issued a warning against Britain “sleepwalking” into a no-deal Brexit, which they said was not a “credible economic strategy”.The Fraser of Allander Institute said that although fears over shortages of food and medicines may be overblown, they could be the unfortunate reality of the UK crashing out of the EU.The think-tank, based at Strathclyde University, issued the warning in a blog post as Theresa May claimed ahead of a visit to Edinburgh on Tuesday that Brexit could result in a brighter future for the whole of the UK.The Prime Minister is in Scotland to sign off a £1.2 billion “city deal” for Edinburgh and the south east of Scotland, with both the Scottish and UK governments committing £300 million towards the projects.Nicola Sturgeon, who will hold talks with the PM, said she must secure agreement on an orderly transition and avoid the “catastrophic prospect of crashing out of the EU without a deal”.She added: “A no-deal Brexit would be utterly unacceptable and deeply damaging, but by talking it up as a negotiating tactic there is a very real danger it becomes a reality.”Theresa May is due in Edinburgh on TuesdayThe Fraser of Allander Institute said that from an economics perspective, it was “hard to believe that we are in a position where senior UK ministers are openly talking about not just a hard Brexit, but no deal”.It added: “Two years on from the referendum outcome, simply kicking the can down the road - or sleepwalking into a no-deal outcome - is simply no longer a credible economic strategy to adopt.It also warned the reality of a no-deal scenario was beginning to hit home, with talk of “food shortages, drug stockpiles and log-jams at the border.The think tank added: Whilst some of this is likely to be overblown, such issues will be the unfortunate reality of the UK crashing out of the EU.It also released a survey showing 75 per cent of firms in Scotland said they had not received enough information about leaving the EU to allow them to plan for the different possible outcomes of Brexit.Only six per cent of those surveyed said the vote to leave the EU had had a positive impact on their business, with 44 per cent saying it had been damaging.A third of firms reported a negative impact on current investment activity, with 41 per cent also saying there had been a negative impact on new investment.Nicola Sturgeon said a no-deal Brexit would be deeply damagingThe findings were revealed after Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, put the chances of the UK failing to come to an agreement with the EU at 60-40, claiming the “intransigence of the European Commission was to blame for “pushing us towards no deal.Researchers found the “overwhelming response” from the 350 businesses they spoke to was that “there is not enough information currently available to enable them to plan for potential Brexit outcomes”.Mrs May also confirmed on Tuesday that two of six new science centres being developed across the UK will be in Dundee and Glasgow.The Edinburgh and south east Scotland city deal will support cutting-edge research at the capital\u0027s three universities, improving housing and transport links and helping to build a new concert hall.The Prime Minister claimed the UK Government was working ahead of Brexit in partnership with business, academia and the devolved administrations to “create more good jobs and spread economic prosperity across the country”.She added: ”By making the most of our country\u0027s assets and the talents of all of our people, we can build a brighter future for the whole UK.”Women more likely to survive heart attack if treated by female doctors Universities’ main purpose is no

Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

By peering back into that ancient time, astronomers can try and understand how our Earth came to support life.And by using those same findings, researchers might be able to understand whether there could be life in other solar systems.The research confirms that important organic materials appear to have been formed at the beginnings of our solar system. By looking at the isotopic signature of the compounds within the rocks, they can find the fingerprints of key elements – including\u0026nbspcarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, all of which are both central to the beginnings of life and have been found inside those rocks.If such organic materials can be formed through relatively simple processes in the early solar system, then they might be widespread elsewhere, too. That might mean that life could be found more often in other planetary systems than we had expected, the researchers suggest.The kind of ancient meteorite studied by the University of Manchester scientists are incredibly rare: known as\u0026nbspcarbonaceous chondrites, they comprise only a few per cent of all known meteorites.

LondonIn the UK, hosepipe bans have been announced, hedgehogs and frogs have been left dying of hunger and thirst, and grass has been scorched yellow during what may yet still be the hottest summer ever.Already July’s average maximum temperature, at 22.5C, was hotter than the same month in the scorching summer of 1976, which recorded an average of 21.6C.And amid news that there are at least two more days of the soaring heat, Public Health England maintained its advice to stay hydrated, keep out the sun where possible between 11am and 2pm, and cover up when outside.But from Wednesday evening onwards Ms Diamond said Britons could expect climes in the UK to cool.“There will be a cool front coming eastwards across the country which will bring cooler and fresher temperatures,” she revealed. “The south and east will still be warmer than average for this time of year but even they will be cooling off.

Some have already agreed to do so.Each CLP is allowed to propose one motion for discussion at conference, with those receiving the most support from delegates at the gathering likely to be put to a vote. The window for submitting motions opened today.The motion could become party policy if passed, but the Labour leadership is\u0026nbsplikely to strongly resist attempts to force it to change tack.Last year, grassroots attempts to have Brexit debated by delegates at\u0026nbspparty conference\u0026nbspwere seen off by Mr Corbyn’s team and trade union Unite, who\u0026nbspfeared they could force a change in party policy.The latest campaign was endorsed by a number of prominent Labour figures.Manuel\u0026nbspCortes,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the\u0026nbspTSSA\u0026nbsptrade union, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit is a Tory con trick for the benefit of the richest one per cent.

I voted ‘out’ in 1975 and I have fought the advance of neo-liberal orthodoxy for decades. But Brexit\u0026nbspisn’t just about Britain’s membership of the EU. Its right wing proponents are the British franchise of a global movement, stretching from Trump in America to\u0026nbspOrban\u0026nbspin Hungary,\u0026nbspSalvini\u0026nbspin Italy and Marine Le Pen in France. \u0026nbsp“Its effects will be to bolster these far-right and neo-fascist movements internationally, and domestically to further deregulate the economy and attack working class people. That’s why I’ll be backing a People’s Vote at this year’s Labour conference.”The move to have the issue\u0026nbspdebated at Labour conference is likely to raise pressure on Mr Corbyn to soften his Brexit stance. A number of senior Labour figures, including shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, have suggested the party could join calls for a\u0026nbspPeople’s Vote. But the Labour leader has insisted: “It’s not our policy to have a second referendum, it’s out policy to respect the result of the referendum.”It\u0026nbspcomes amid\u0026nbspsigns of growing support for a fresh referendum\u0026nbspamong left-wing supporters of Mr Corbyn. The influential Momentum campaign group\u0026nbspis set to vote on a motion calling for a People’s Vote after a\u0026nbsppetition started by a member in the London borough of Tower Hamlets received\u0026nbspthe 4,000 signatures needed to trigger a ballot of all\u0026nbspMomentum members.\u0026nbspIf passed, it\u0026nbspwould put Momentum\u0026nbspat odds with Mr Corbyn, who the organisation\u0026nbspwas founded to support.\u0026nbspRees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011The Labour for a People’s Vote motion says the Brexit strategy\u0026nbspbeing pursued by Theresa May “is a threat to jobs, freedom of movement, peace in Northern Ireland, and the future of the NHS and public services”.It continues: “Tory Brexit will wreck the British economy, will commit us to a series of long-term trade deals which will enforce American-style deregulation, and will undermine the rights, freedoms and protections currently enshrined in EU law. All of this will bind the hands of a future Labour government, and will make it far harder for us to deliver on our promises.”It says Labour must “oppose any Brexit deal that does not satisfy Labour’s six\u0026nbsptests” and instead “call for an immediate general election, and make a manifesto commitment to call a public vote on the Brexit deal with an option to remain in the EU if the public rejects it”.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteMore than 500,000 back The Independent’s Final Say on Brexit campaignAs a Momentum member, this is why I back a Final SayNational Union of Students backs The Independent’s Final Say campaign If the party “cannot get a general election”, the motion says it should “campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to remain in the EU and following a defeat for the government,\u0026nbspcall for an immediate general election”.\u0026nbspThe launch of the campaign\u0026nbspcoincides with\u0026nbspa nationwide “Left Against Brexit” tour to encourage left-wing activists to speak out against Brexit. Organised by the cross-party Another Europe is Possible group, events have been held in a number of major cities and many more are planned for the coming weeks.\u0026nbspMarina\u0026nbspPrentoulis, a spokesperson for Another Europe is Possible, said: “Time is up on the Brexit process, and the only version of Brexit we are going to get is a Tory one. If Labour comes to power before exit day, we will be faced with a choice between no deal and an off-the-shelf Norway-style deal – a choice between economic catastrophe and a becoming a rule taker with no say in the making of EU rules. No one voted for this, and implementing it\u0026nbspisn’t the democratic option.“Democracy means giving the people the right to determine their own future, with a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal with an option to stay in the EU if it is rejected.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereLabour for a People\u0027s VoteEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/09/kane-wwe.jpg  width= 2088  height= 1342  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/09/kane-wwe.jpg","title":"wwe kane glenn jacobs future mayor knox county election","story":"Created with Sketch.He is a supportor of President Trump, who has also graced the WWE ringClick to followThe Independent USWWE wrestler Kane elected mayor of Knox County, TennesseeGlenn Jacobs, best known as Kane - a long-serving WWE superstar and former world champion - has been elected mayor of the third-most populous county in Tennessee.Running as a Republican, Jacobs defeated Democratic candidate Linda Haney\u0026nbsp31,739 votes to 16,611.Jacobs was born in Spain and grew up near St. Louis, Missouri, though his character Kane is infamously billed as hailing from either Hell or parts unknown.The 51-year-old unseated a Democrat to become Knox County\u0027s 29th mayor, running as a libertarian and promising tax cuts along with improvements to education and infrastructure.As of the 2010 census, the Knox County population was 432,226.Jacobs, whose wrestling persona nickname is The Big Red Machine (appropriately, given the GOP embraces the colour) said he was met with “pretty astounding laughter” among the political establishment when he first announced his plans to run for mayor but that this made me want it even more.”The Independent has contacted the WWE to find out how the news will affect Kane\u0027s wrestling career.

This decision was made by the committee, who were fully alive to the local opposition.There would seem to be no merit in seeking to revoke the permission granted by the committee in such circumstances in the absence of any new material considerations having come to light.

Then, on August 2018 his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story...Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the 2010 General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the 1997 General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fife.He has batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His wife is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram.He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Boniface Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May 2018 it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £5million house just around the corner from No 10 Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.The children’s comic has accused the Tory of copying its character Walter the Softy - by wearing round glasses, liking classical music and being snooty.The publication says it has sent the politician a letter  for him to cease and desist from “impersonating” Dennis the Menace’s antagonist, saying he was around first.Beanos Mike Stirling accused Rees-Mogg of masquerading as Walter Brown, after the similarities were spotted by young readers of the comic and its beano website.He said: We were flattered when we discovered that Jacob Rees-Mogg has dedicated his life to impersonating one of my favourite Beano characters, young Walter.Nonetheless, as a hard-working British media company, we would prefer the public gets its Walter fix in the pages of our comics and on Beano , rather than played out on the political stage. In other words, bog off Rees-Mogg!But Rees-Mogg said: “Compared to me Walter is a tough guy.”In February Rees-Mogg attended a talk at the University of West England (UWE) in Bristol.However, the night was marred after a group of protesters wearing balaclavas burst into the room, with witnesses saying they were chanting fascist scum in the MPs direction.Video from the scuffle appears to show the Brexiteer attempting to stop a clash between protesters and onlookers.Bristol University student William Brown told The Sun Online he first noticed the fire doors rattling, with the group of protesters bursting into the room.He said: These people in balaclavas and sunglasses started shouting, things like Tory fascist.They were quite intimidating actually.They were waving their hands around, shouting very loudly. He said that a few punches were thrown, but no one appeared to be badly injured.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, life begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted that if he ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £5million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.Mr Rees-Mogg added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Chelsea star and this years Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star said elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the 23-year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.It happened on August 1, 2018 when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs 17th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £5.6m house in Westminster.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared. How about this for an idea: let’s all try to be kind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We ran to the beach to be clear of buildings which we could hear falling all around.What we know so far...Local authorities said those stranded on the Gilis - the three tropical islands popular with backpackers and divers - were being evacuated today.But footage posted online showed panicked tourists and locals packed onto powder-white beaches before climbing over each other to board tiny boats leaving the island.Meanwhile frightened residents across all affected islands, particularly north Lombok, poured out of their homes and moved to higher ground after the quake triggered a Tsunami warning.Kelsall added: It was literally the most terrifying thing I have experienced and the uncertainty of the tsunami - I had pictures of Thailand in my head from when it happened there.Pop superstar Gary Barlow was one of the unfortunate tourists whose holidays were cut abruptly short by the devastating earthquake.He shared footage of himself doing yoga in an iddylic island location in the days before the quake hit and killed more than 100 people.As and many other foreign tourists fled the country, he wrote on Twitter: I bumped into so many British families leaving Bali. How lucky we are to have that choice.I’ve had the misfortune of being in 7 earthquakes but none have felt more deep and raw as last nights.Followed by numerous after shocks. Praying for everyone affected.Michelle Thompson, an American who was holidaying on one of the Gilis with her husband, described a violent scramble to get on boats leaving for the main island.She said: People were just throwing their suitcases on board and I had to struggle to get my husband on because he was bleeding.Muhammad Faozal, head of West Nusa Tenggaras tourism agency, said: We cannot evacuate all of them all at once because we dont have enough capacity on the boats.Its understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking.Some areas still hadnt been reached because rescuers have been slowed down by collapsed bridges, electricity blackouts and damaged roads.On Lombok, soldiers and other rescuers carried injured people on stretchers and carpets to evacuation centres, with many having to be treated outdoors because hospitals were too damaged.More terrifying footage showed screaming people running from their homes in Bali as cars and bikes rocked shook on the roads.Terrified tourists, including Barlow and supermodel Chrissy Teigen, took to Twitter to reveal their horror as tremors ripped through the island.Authorities issued a tsunami warning in the aftermath which covers North Lombok, East and North Bali, the north side of east Java, south-east Madura, south Kalimantan, and south Sulawesi.Barlow had been unwinding in a peaceful retreat by meditating, pictures of which he had shared with fans on Instagram who then became worried when news broke of the quake.After his ordeal, he tweeted: Thank you for your concern - we’re all fine - a bit shaken up.The quake was felt for several seconds in Bali, where people ran out of houses, hotels and restaurants.All the hotel guests were running so I did too. People filled the streets, said Michelle Lindsay, an Australian tourist.A lot of officials were urging people not to panic.Model Chrissy Teigen, who is in Bali, was live tweeting in the aftermath of quake, reporting: Bali. Trembling. So long.Moments earlier she had written: MASSIVE earthquake.Dazed and confused, she then walked out of her home clutching her baby while undressed.Other witnesses said the quake got stronger over several seconds and rattled windows and doors in their frames.Brit holidaymaker Reuben Messam, from Bedfordshire, told Sun Online he was in a small village of Bedugul in Bali.He said:  We were eating dinner when the quake occurred then suddenly the floor started to shake,  people started to panic. I saw people running towards the door.But then someone started to shout get under the table and then glasses of beer were falling off.The waiters and the waitresses said they were scared as it is very rare to have one this big..Tourist Hannah Small told : We are saying in Ubud, our whole hotel was shaking and parts of the ceiling and walls were falling down.It was awful, we rushed from the third floor to reach safety!Like Bali, Lombok is known for pristine beaches and mountains.Hotels and other buildings in both locations are not allowed to exceed the height of coconut trees.Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424839196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg home vandalised","story":"The yobs — thought to be anti-Brexit anarchists — sprayed “scum” in white paint on his wife’s green Land Rover.A dildo covered with a condom was then stuck on the bonnet, alongside an anarchist symbol.The phrases “****head and “shut up and die” were scrawled on the garage.The louts also wrote “posh scum” and “politics death” on a patio window at the Leave-supporting MP’s estate in West Harptree, Somerset.Another anarchist sign was sprayed on a bench and “t**t” written on a ­garden umbrella stand.Condoms were strewn on the lawn and left hanging from a small cross.The vandals struck last Wednesday night while Mr Rees-Mogg, 49, was on a family holiday in New York.His maid discovered the dildo and graffiti on Thursday morning.Avon and Somerset Police suspect the condoms are a nod to the Catholic MP’s anti-birth control views.Mr Rees-Mogg said: “It appears to be someone who can’t hold their drink — and probably not Catholic.However, it has all been cleared up so this drunken protest will not even have a short-term effect.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite widespread public revulsion with the habit elsewhere in the world, neither killing dogs to eat nor consuming their meat is illegal in Britain.A total ban on the import, trade and consumption of dog meat is about to be enacted across America by the US Congress next month after similar concerns about its increase there.The government is being urged to repeat the US ban here, and the move last night won the backing of a series of senior MPs. The World Dog Alliance will launch a nationwide campaign in the UK for a full ban on any interaction with dog meat in the Autumn.The WDA’s Kike Yuen told The Sun last night: “In the US, people who eat dog meat are mainly immigrants from Asia. With three million immigrants from East Asia in the UK, we cannot deny this situation exists here too”.Mr Yeun added: “We also believe legislation against dog meat in UK would provide us with strength to continue our work in Asia, as the UK could influence other countries to stop dog meat consumption. Most of them usually refused to do so with the excuse that there is no such law in Western countries”.It is still legal to kill dogs and eat them in the UK, as long as they are killed in a way that does not cause suffering. Though the practice has been taboo across much of Europe for a century, there is also no specific ban on buying or selling dog meat either.Dog lover and Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan last night dubbed a full ban “absolutely right”. Sir Alan, who owns a prize-winning cockapoo called Noodle, said: “There is no need in the modern world for this disgusting habit. We should nip it in the bud now to make sure the practice never takes off here. A civilised country is decent to animals, so let’s be fully decent here.”The chair of the All-party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group Lisa Cameron MP added: “I very much support a ban on dog meat consumption in the UK, and urge the Government to look at this as a matter of urgency. We must be culturally sensitive, but I do not believe the general public would approve of the practice at all.”The SNP MP added: “Dogs are sentient beings and we value them very highly as pets. The last thing we want is dog farms here”.An estimated 30 million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.In China, 20 per cent of the population still eat dog meat - some because of the superstitious belief that it is a health tonic - and the country accounts for half the annual slaughter.In South Korea, 60 per cent of people eat dog meat regularly, and 5 million dogs are slaughtered each year to feed their appetite. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last night refused to comment.BRITAIN is a nation of dog-lovers.Our four-legged friends heroically work alongside our police, fire services and armed forces.They assist the disabled.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The liar may lean away from the person they are lying to.3. The liar may cross their legs so that their top leg blocks the person they are lying to.4. The liar may sit with their back half turned towards the person they are lying to.5. The liar may well self-sooth to calm themselves by repeatedly touching their face or rubbing their forehead.The most common fib among those polled is simply stating everything is fine, followed by pretending to like a gift you’ve received.Saying you’re busy, lying about being stuck in traffic and saying you’re on your way round off the top five most common untruths.Researchers also found Brits tend to lie their partner most frequently, followed by their work colleagues and their boss.But our other halves are also the person we find it hardest to fib to.Dr Sally Baker, added: “Sometimes people lie to build themselves up - to have the advantage and their lies are self-serving.“Some people just lie all the time, small inconsequential lies that allow them to hide their true-self and they may be motivated by lack of self-esteem.2.

aided by his teeth loss in later years - would be recognised with several honours and accolades.Few awards surpassed his victory in the Ugly Duckling competition on the hit TV show The Golden Shot — hosted by the legendary Bob Monkhouse.But his runner up finishes in the World Gurning Championships — where competitors battle it out to pull the most hideous face possible — were also up there among his most impressive career highlights.He reached second place a total of three times in his illustrious face-bending career.But day-to-day Dai was more than happy to keep families giggling with appearances at carnivals and fairs in Cynon Valley.Local historian Bernard Baldwin said that the much-loved Mr Llewelyn was the master of make-believe”.He wrote in his book Mountain Ash Remembered: He figured prominently in every carnival ever held in the town, and year after year appeared in some costume that was original — and often unique.On one occasion he appeared as the Lord Mayor of Mountain Ash, fresh from the soup kitchen.“He appeared in a tattered suit, a battered top hat and wearing a chain of office.“On another occasion he appeared as Popeye — and nobody looked more like the famous sailor than Popeye himself!”His death in 1983, at the age of 87, was a blow to the community.But his legacy lives on as the World Gurning Championship continues to grow in prestige and competitor numbers.Taking place at the Egremont Crab Fair in the Lake District — which having been established in 1267 is one of the longest-running fairs in the world — the gurning contest is among its most popular events.Contestants have to put their heads through a horse collar and snarl like a dog, look savage, and distort their faces.If he knew today the impact he has had on the noble sport, Dai Llewelyn would be sure to crack a smile — no matter how ugly it was."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gangsters.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"540\" width=\"960","title":"joel henry gang dip sheets","story":"But if things had worked out differently, 26-year-old Joel would likely be competing in an entirely different arena – one where scorecards centre not on your sports prowess but stabbings and maiming.Young gang members call them dip sheets - a tally of the number of people they have stabbed.Gangsters refer to who is on their dip sheet in controversial drill raps, where rival postcode gangs use the gritty music genre to taunt their rivals and threaten whoever they plan on stabbing next.This was once Joel’s way of life too.In his early teens he was in a gang where stabbings, shootings, and crime were not just the norm but expected, while the creed he lived by was that protecting the honour of the fam – not just his own blood family but his fellow gang members – came first.Only when a friend was shot dead in front of him when he was 15 years old was he able to set his life on a different course.Joel’s story is one of those told in Channel 5 series Lawless Britain which looks at the gang culture sweeping Britain.It’s estimated that up to 70,000 people under 25 consider themselves part of a gang – with many of them paying a heavy price for their affiliations.In the last two years there has been a 40 per cent rise in the number of deaths from gang stabbings and feuding.In the series the heavily masked and disguised gang members are given cameras to film for themselves on the street to show what life is like on the inside.It’s chilling. As they handle their serrated blades the gang members – girls among them - boast that fast money is the goal, and that you live, and die, by the streets.They are mantras Joel recognises only too well. Raised in London - he doesnt want to say which part - alongside two older siblings by his single parent mum, he grew up in an environment saturated with gang culture.Family members I looked up to were deeply involved in gang culture, he tells Sun Online. I’d see them coming back with money and jewellery and I wanted some of that.By 13 he was fully involved. It’s just a natural transition. When you’re a kid you’re not saying ‘what am I in?’ - it just happens.You don’t see it as a gang – it’s family so whatever you need to do to help the family you do it, you clean the pot.The gang gave him a sense of belonging that was absent elsewhere. There’s a lot of love around you. I didn’t have a lot of male figureheads in my family so these men were my role models, showing me how to survive.But this education went hand-in-hand with casual violence in which carrying a knife was routine.From an early age I saw people getting stabbed, shooting, robbing, slapped, he says.Growing up in this lifestyle I knew I was going to die if I don’t carry one. It was a badge of honour. People asked what kind of knife you had – it was all mine is this number of inches long.His mum and older brother were unaware of his affiliations, although his sister knew.She knew I wasn’t an idiot and she always had my back. But in some ways it was a double life.Yet even as a young teen, Joel had his misgivings.There had been a few moments where I thought I’m getting in too deep. There was this gradual realisation that this life was going nowhere good, he says.A realisation cemented when, aged 15, he saw a friend shot dead in front of him at a party.Joel was talking to another friend when he heard the boom of the gunshot.I saw the guy he was shooting at, his head just went straight back and he flew back and he was not moving on the floor.He didn’t make it. And I just thought: you know what there must be more to this - it’s a cycle that’s never going to end.Breaking free was easier said than done though.It helped that my school shut down and I changed schools to an academy filled with the best basketball players with the country. I’d played a bit at my old school but when I saw the basketball scene in my new school I caught the bug.Gradually training started to replace the time he had spent with his gang, although he still saw them from time to time. There was a lot of pressure, he recalls.I’d go to a birthday party and you could feel the shift in the energy. It was all I don’t see you round here any more. The ties were loosening all the time but I knew how easily I could get pulled back in.At 16 he was chosen to play in a tournament in Virginia in the US - another turning point.Going there - you realise there’s this big world out there and I was just wow – I wanted more of it, he recalls.His coach was a big support. He sat me down and asked me what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be in five years, Joel recalls. I had never been asked that before. I had never looked ahead before, seen a future.It was the spur he needed. From then on basketball became my sole focus. I sweated blood and tears.Rain or shine I was practising. It was hard but rewarding too. Playing basketball you get a different kind of love – there’s this positive energy.Community college followed before, aged 22, Joel got an agent and started playing professional basketball, first in London and then for the Surrey Scorchers.Such was his talent that today Joel makes his living through dunk contests, putting on shows throughout the globe, from Romania to Russia, The Caribbean to the USA displaying his unique talents on the court.He knows is a world away from the streets where he used to live and to which he sometimes returns. There’s still a lot of love there for my fam. We’ve all grown up together and they respect that I’m chasing my dreams.It doesn’t stop him worrying about the next generation. I’ve got little nephews and nieces and I worry about how they are going to get on in this scary time we’re living in, he says.A time where the stakes seem ever higher.Fuelled by drill music - a form of rap which glorifies gang life, with videos displaying weapons, describing recent stabbings and issuing threats to rivals – the death toll among young teens continues to steadily rise.Meanwhile, one surgeon interviewed in Lawless Britain reveals that in the last decade attacks have become more calculated and brutal.The types of blades that are being used are more severe, there are serrated blades and the individuals seem to know here to attack people anatomically, how to attack to inflict life-changing injuries, he says.It comes as little surprise to Joel. It’s scary to hear that people want to act this way although I don’t think it’s anything new - I just think it’s more in your face, he says.Gang life is a lot more commercialised now – social media has given people easier bragging rights. Kids are trying to do it for sport, to make a name for themselves.Is there any way the tide of senseless violence can be stopped?A lot of kids are bored and lost - they haven’t got a passion, they don’t know what to do with themselves. Instead of putting more laws in place we need to give them opportunities.That’s the single biggest thing we could do. Because without hope they don’t have a chance of getting out.Joel of course knows this first hand. I’ve gained the world. And I want to say to other gangs: there’s a whole world out there they have to see - and it’s beautiful.Lawless Britain: Gangs, Knives, Killers - tonight at 10pm Channel 5Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We ran to the beach to be clear of buildings which we could hear falling all around.Power and communications were severed in some areas, with landslides and a collapsed bridge blocking access to areas around the quake epicentre in the north.The military said it would send a ship with medical aid, supplies and logistics support.The tremor was powerful enough to be felt on the neighbouring island of Bali where, BNPB said, two people died.

From a distance, the animal could look like a squid.She added: The body was very soft because it was so rotten and there were long, orange stripes along the body which are the pleats of the expandable throat of the humpback whale.Perhaps these looked like tentacles from afar.Fisherman first described the 30ft globster as having eyes the size of dinner plates.The eyes, however, were actually the rotting socket joint of the whales pectoral fin.Globsters have such a peculiar appearance because of how they deteriorate.The blubber gets real soft and gooey when it rots, said Vollenweider.The animal was also probably mutilated by hungry animals.The scientists suspect that the whale might have washed up on a beach and been eaten by eagles and brown bears.It is believed that the animal was killed by a ship strike - the evidence points towards blunt force trauma to the body.In May 2018, a 20ft globster washed up in The Philippines and many locals saw it to be an omen for impending doom."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425091211-e1533570268176.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"surrey mansion for sale playhouse zip wire trampoline","story":"The jaw-dropping Pinewood House in Oxshott, Surrey, also features a 50ft ballroom, two swimming pools, cinema, bar, gym, sauna and a steam room.For gearheads it also offers an underground garage that has parking for 20 cars.And Londoners who dont want to move too far from the capital need not worry as you can see as far as Canary Wharf that is 20 miles away thanks to its observatory tower.During the First World War the Grade II listed property was owned by shipping magnate Arnold Trinder, whose fleet of ships was instrumental in breaking the German U-boat blockade.The house still has some maritime features paying tribute to Trinders time at the property.However by the 1950s it had been subdivided into three properties and was in a poor state of repair.Polish builder Andrew Holeshowski bought one of the three for less than £500,000 in 1993 and by 2007 he had bought up his neighbours properties too.Mr Holeshowski embarked on a three-year £10m renovation project to turn Pinewood back into a single home and restore its grandeur.Period features, including a fresco depicting scenes of Miltons Paradise Lost in the drawing room, have been restored.The dramatic double height Great Hall has intricately carved wooden pillars and an impressive carved stone fireplace while the ballroom has gold leaf hand-painted ceiling plasterwork and the walls of the bathroom attached are also covered in the same 24K gold leaf.The impressive home is also fitted with air conditioning, underfloor heating and dozens of hidden speakers providing music throughout the house.In total the house has 28,501 sq ft of accommodation over four floors with a grand galleried reception hall, drawing room, sitting room, ballroom, library, formal kitchen, commercial kitchen with cool room and pantry.It also has a lounge bar, wine cellar, spa room, indoor swimming pool, steam room, sauna, gym, a choice of two master bedroom suites with a dressing room and en suite bathroom, seven further bedrooms and bathrooms, an Art Deco style cinema room with triple screen and a bar area.There is also staff accommodation within the house and a separate four-bedroom cottage that could be used for guests or staff.Its hilltop position gives the house views over Crown Estate land - woodland, green fields and as far as London landmark buildings on the horizon.And the unique home is just as impressive outside in the three acres of grounds. The manicured gardens are heart-shaped, it has extensive split level terracing and its own adventure playground for the children.As well as the almost 6,000 sq ft underground car park, the house has outdoor parking for a further 15 cars by the terrace at the front of the house and there is additional staff parking for another 12 cars.Liz Berman, from Strutt and Parker, said: Pinewood House is an amazing property. Its a very grand house that sits on top of the hill, encompassed by its own gardens and not overlooked at all.Its got everything you could want and everything is immaculate. The lawns are perfectly manicured.Its definitely a London retreat, Oxshott is about 25 minutes into Waterloo station. Its very popular as that first step when people are looking to move out of London but dont want to be fully in the countryside.If you still want that civilised suburban feel this is perfect, but you are within minutes of open countryside.The house speaks for itself really, youll either love it or hate it. Its one of those houses that is very special and well known in Oxshott because it is quite grand.Even if you dont sell it to the parents, youll definitely convince the children with the incredible playhouse. The owners spent a fortune building that and its just an amazing thing.You cant keep the kids off it - its on an elevated level and has got a safety surface, its like a professional assault course.For the adults there is a beautiful indoor pool, which you can open up to the terrace, and for anyone who has a big car collection this would be perfect.

Its survey found that 44.8 per cent worry about the state of their personal finances almost every day, 11.8 per cent hardly ever had enough money to cover all essentials and 3.8 per cent took out a payday loan last year.Federation boss John Apter said: “Our members are clearly suffering from even worse financial pressures than last year, with some appearing to be in dire straits.“Our members are under immense pressure to deliver, with dwindling resources and rising crime, leading to a demand for our services that has never been higher. All they want is to be adequately paid for the job that they do.”Last month, the Government announced a two per cent pay rise for officers, but the Federation branded that “derisory”.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

take a look at who could take over as the next leader if Jeremy Corbyn was to be ousted, or step down, from the top spot.The favourites include Emily Thornberry, as well as fellow shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner, Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, while Mr Corbyn’s right-hand man John McDonnell has long been seen as a leader-in-waiting.Alex Apati from bookmakers Ladbrokes said: With 3 of the top 4 runners being female and Emily Thornberry the clear 5/1 favourite, its looking increasingly likely that a woman will take over from Jeremy Corbyn as Labours next leader.Asked about where punters are putting their money, he told The Sun: Over the last week the two most popular selections with punters have been Rebecca Long Bailey and John McDonnell, with the latter possibly being viewed as Corbyns preferred replacement if he was to step down.“There has also been some money for David Miliband over the last few days, in from 33/1 to 25/1.Here we profile the runners and riders:Becoming Labour leader would be the culmination of a remarkable turnaround for the woman booted out of Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet after her sneering tweet about a house with a white van and an England flag back in 2014.She has somehow managed to shed her New Labour image, and despite being the wife of a millionaire High Court judge, has become a senior player in the Corbyn administration.The MP for Islington South, the next door constituency to Jeremy Corbyn’s, has impressed when deputising for him at Prime Minister’s Questions in recent months.She could be a uniting figure, but would need to be endorsed by the left if she is to win a vote among the Corbynista base.The shadow education secretary has a compelling back story – leaving school with no qualifications as a pregnant teenager, working her way up to the shadow cabinet.Having only become an MP in 2015 she has no baggage to carry within the party, and has been unflinchingly loyal to Mr Corbyn.A former care worker and union official, and now a grandma at 38, she has failed to make an impression outside of Westminster in the past two years.But Mr Corbyn himself has admitted she could “absolutely” become leader, when asked about her and fellow rising star Rebecca Long-Bailey.The shadow Brexit secretary and former director of public prosecutions has won many admirers for his forensic examinations of David Davis over the Government’ Brexit plan in the House of Commons.But he has frequently been at odds with the leader’s office over what direction Labour should be doing in with regards our EU exit, and would potentially make the party more pro-Remain.And the Holborn MP has failed to back Labour’s new anti-Semitism code, urging the party to “reflect” on the row and repair relations with the Jewish community.An uncharismatic and somewhat dreary public speaker, it seems unlikely he would inspire the grassroots in the way the current leader has, but is respected among Labour MPs.Another of the 2015 intake tipped to take over, the Salford MP is seen as John McDonnell’s protégé – once calling her part of the “next generation of our socialist leadership”.If the shadow chancellor doesn’t run himself he could be a powerful backer of the 38-year-old shadow business secretary.But while she is becoming more accomplished as a media performer she has no name recognition at all among the wider public, however she would be seen as ideologically sound by fans of Mr Corbyn.Long seen as Mr Corbyn’s natural successor, the shadow chancellor’s odds have widened since last year’s election.The 66-year-old firebrand is a firm favourite of Labour members but there have recently been splits between him and his boss on policy and presentation – calling for the investigation into Margaret Hodge to be dropped.He recently hired a new press spokesman, prompting speculation he was eyeing up the role, but would potentially only be a stop-gap before handing over to one of the younger Corbyn acolytes.Would also bring a lot of baggage, given his positive comments about the IRA.A former shadow cabinet member, she resigned in protest at Mr Corbyn’s leadership in June 2016 along with a raft of other MPs.Seen as being on the “soft left” wing of the party, the Wigan MP has been tipped as a potential leader if the party is to be dragged back towards the centre.An accomplished media performer, she was a strong campaigner during the “Pestminster” harassment scandal, but would only have a chance of winning a vote of the membership if the Corbynite vote was split between two candidates.Has built his own power base since swapping Parliament for City Hall in 2016 to become Mayor of London.Strongly anti-Brexit, he has been outspoken of a raft of issues, and is one of only a few Labour politicians with nationwide recognition, but has often angered Corbynistas.The recent crime spate in the capital has damaged his reputation, and he has already said he plans on seeking another term – keeping him away from Westminster until at least 2020 if not 2024.Failed in her bid to be leader once before, the former Cabinet minister would struggle to win over the membership given her history with the Blair and Brown governments.She is well-respected in Westminster, and has won plaudits for her work taking on Theresa May and other ministers on various committees – helping push Amber Rudd to resign over Windrush.But unless the party moves back to the centre that seems to be as far as she can go, while her husband Ed Balls waltzes his way to becoming a light entertainment star. The Blairite’s Blairite, the Streatham MP has carved out a career as Labour’s most pro-EU campaigner, spearheading the push for a second referendum to reverse Brexit.If the negotiations with Brussels go badly and public opinion swings wildly in favour of staying in the bloc then he has an outside chance of leading a Remain-backing party.But in every other area of policy the slick media performer would be seen as wildly too right-wing for the Corbynistas.For years seen as some kind of “prince across the water” by the party’s Blairite wing, he has been working for a charity in America since exiting British politics in 2012.The former Foreign Secretary, has long hinted at a return to Westminster, but would find a very different party to the one he left behind

Rosemary is a shining example of that extraordinary commitment.Over the decades Rosemary has helped to change the lives of thousands of Armed Forces personnel, veterans, and their families, and that is a legacy to be truly proud of.Rosemary is most deserving of this honour, and everyone at the Legion wishes her a very happy retirement."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425117944.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the queen held her nose when a shetland","story":"Her Majesty, 92, pinched one of her nostrils in a bid to avoid the almighty pong near the gates of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.A three-year-old steed had shunned royal protocol by defecating and leaving a pile of manure within breathing distance of the monarch.The beast, who serves as the regimental mascot of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, has crossed paths with the her before.Last year the Queen told him to “go away” when he tried to nibble her bunch of flowers during a visit to Stirling Castle in Scotland.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes it is its largest military player. Yes we are a cultural powerhouse. Yes we are their biggest individual market. Britain is powerful - but the EU is more powerful than we are.On paper - this should not be surprising, yet no politician, of any stripe, would ever dare say it.But the facts speak for themselves: We are 65 million of a bloc of 450 million. Ours is a $2.9trn (\u0026#1632.2trn) economy, they are $19trn (\u0026#16314.6trn) They represent 44% of our exports. We, just 9% of theirs. They are 27 - we are one.The impact of a no deal (as all the studies show) would be considerable but they have a crucial advantage: they are able to spread the risk and burden. For that reason, the same studies show, it would hurt us far more. We have nowhere else to turn.This should not be surprising. Imagine another country taking Britain\u0027s place - that we had \u0027Frexit\u0027 or \u0027Nexit\u0027 or \u0027Spexit\u0027 or even \u0027Deutschexit\u0027, ask yourself where the power would lie. It would be with the remaining states of the union.That we struggle to come to terms with that is, I think, deeply revealing of the British psyche.This imbalance was obscured through years of membership - we had no need to confront our own relative weakness as a member of the club - but now we are outside, that asymmetry of power is exposed for all to see.That is why we have accepted concession after concession, not because of Theresa May\u0027s pusillanimity but because of the hard truths of realpolitik.That is why Mrs May and her ministers have been conducting a grand tour of Europe. Not because they want yet more sea bass and asparagus in yet another state dinner, but because they recognise how powerful they are as a bloc and how isolated we are in their face.They want to tear them asunder, to divide and conquer - this is what David Davis said would happen during the referendum. Yet, they have remained, in 18 months a united set of two, while our own house, our own government, has been fatally divided.Time and again throughout our history, Britain has acted to prevent the emergence of a hegemonic power which controlled all of Europe, aware that Britain, even with an empire, could not resist a united continent\u0027s gravitational pull. Today\u0027s crop of politicians, seem to have forgotten that lesson. Looked at through the psychology of the British public\u0027s collective psyche, we can see Mrs May as the Wizard of Oz - less powerful than her people think, or than our population would like others to believe.That is what is invidious about Brexit for British politicians - for the British public to accept Chequers, or something like it, would essentially be to ask the British people to accept a downgrade of their own view of British power, a downgrade of the sort of country we think we should be and that we think we are.We are not an especially jingoistic nation, but that is much to stomach. It is a view which, however unfair, would be repeated and churned by the exact Brexiteers who, from Mrs May\u0027s point of view, forced us to accept the downgrade in the first place."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-brexit-fox_4381580.jpg?20180805182151 ","title":"liam fox faces ridicule over u turn on brexit no deal","story":"So what has changed? A lot, actually. The Chequers deal has bombed with Tory MPs and activists, including members of the PM\u0027s own association in Maidenhead.Two senior cabinet ministers, David Davis and Boris Johnson, have resigned, with Mr Davis\u0027s former lieutenants Steve Baker and Stewart Jackson now acting as pro-Brexit attack dogs.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is now firmly re-installed as the darling of the Tory grassroots and the hot favourite with the activists to replace Mrs May as party leader and prime minister.Then there has been the reaction to the Chequers deal from Michel Barnier, accused by Dr Fox in his Sunday Times interview of \"intransigence\" and of making no deal more likely. In his lofty, patrician manner and with customary \"hauteur\", Mr Barnier picked the Chequers plan apart clause by clause, to the extent that even its biggest fans fear it is now mort dans l\u0027eau.And that\u0027s one reason why Theresa May was probably wasting her time when she went to the French president\u0027s Riviera retreat and told him Brussels faces a choice between the Chequers deal and no deal.When I went to Strasbourg for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s address to the European Parliament in April, I was told by senior MEPs that the president and Mr Barnier are extremely close politically.As a result, President Macron - probably the EU\u0027s chief powerbroker now that Angela Merkel\u0027s authority is waning - will ensure that his \"uncle\" succeeds Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission next year.No wonder President Macron told Mrs May at Napoleon\u0027s stronghold of Fort Bregancon that he was not willing to break the Brexit deadlock by breaking ranks with the EU\u0027s negotiators.\"There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Monsieur Barnier,\" a French diplomat was reported to have said, confirming the president\u0027s close alignment with Mr Barnier.And so in spite of Mrs May\u0027s Riviera charm offensive, there has at the same time been a significant change in tone in the government\u0027s Brexit language in recent weeks, as the Chequers plan has faced derision and rejection. First there has been what Brexiteers claim has been a return of \"project fear\" scare stories, about stockpiling of food and medicines, lorry gridlock at Dover, long queues at border control and customs and fees for travel visas.But the biggest change in tone has come in the Foreign Office, where Boris Johnson\u0027s clown-like bluster and looseness with facts and detail have been replaced by the more thoughtful approach of Jeremy Hunt.Instead of Mr Johnson\u0027s gung-ho and cavalier approach to Brexit, former Remainer Mr Hunt has been deadly serious in his warnings of the risk of \"no deal by accident\" increasing by the day.Then last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - denounced as \"the high priest of Project Fear\" by Jacob Rees-Mogg - said the risk of no deal was \"uncomfortably high and highly undesirable\".Are all these dire warnings aimed at putting pressure on Brussels to sign up to a deal? Almost certainly. Will they work? Probably not. But then some hardline Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches have always favoured no deal.The danger for the prime minister, however, is that the more no deal looks likely the louder the calls from pro-Remain MPs and campaigners for a second referendum - a so-called \"people\u0027s vote\" - will become."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-uk-weather-river-stour_4382175.jpg?20180806154214 ","title":"make the most of it before heatwave cools off","story":"It follows a sweltering weekend across the UK where the hottest temperature of 30.2C (86.36F) was recorded in Northolt, Greater London, on Sunday.The mercury is set to rise past 30C (85F) in parts of the UK on Monday, with 33C (91F) possible in London and to the east of the capital, the Met Office said.A level three heat health warning for the South East was issued as a result, with a 90% chance of heatwave conditions for the region between Monday and Wednesday.

The 27-year-old all-rounder is accused of punching Ryan Hale, 27, to the ground and then allegedly knocking out Ryan Ali, 28, a short time later during a fracas in the early hours of September 25 last year. A jury at Bristol Crown Court heard that Stokes mocked a gay couple and verbally abused a bouncer before knocking out the two men. Stokes, 27, “lost control” after a boozy night out in a club, it was alleged. He appeared in court yesterday with Ali, 28, and Hale, 27, who were both punched by the sportsman. The first day of their affray trial heard that “aggressive” Stokes knocked out Army veteran Hale then put fireman Ali in hospital with a fractured eye socket. But England all-rounder Stokes insisted his use of force was “reasonable and justified”, and claimed the brawl was sparked by “nasty homophobic language” by the two men he floored. All three co-defendants deny affray. Prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis told the jury Stokes’ violence was “not a trivial moment of unpleasantness” and that the star “lost his control” and attacked out of “revenge or retaliation”. The violence erupted in Bristol city centre last September. Stokes and England teammate Alex Hales, 29, were out drinking in the hours after the team’s victory over the West Indies, while Ali and Hale were \u0026shycelebrating a work promotion.  All four were in the Mbargo club in the city but did not bump into each other until the early hours when trouble began on a nearby street, the jury heard. Mr Corsellis said the cricketers returned to the nightclub after closing time at 2am and tried to get back in after they had left an hour earlier. The court was told doorman Andrew Cunningham refused them entry – despite the pair offering \u0026pound60. Mr Corsellis said Stokes verbally abused the bouncer, telling him his gold teeth “make you look like a c***” and that his tattoos were “sh**”. CCTV footage played to the court showed Stokes outside the club with Mr Hales. Stokes allegedly began to mimic two gay men – Kai Barry and William O’Connor – who had just left the venue. Mr Corsellis said video showed Stokes throwing a cigarette butt at the Mr O’Connor’s head. The court was told the bouncer told Stokes: “If you are going to start on anyone, start on me.” Mr Corsellis said footage showed Stokes and Mr Hales “sharing a moment of hilarity” at the expense of Mr O’Connor, before Stokes tried to shake hands with the bouncer. When Mr Cunningham refused, Stokes was caught on camera gesticulating wildly. Mr Corsellis said: “It seemed to enrage him, the hand gestures, the head \u0026shymovement back. It all needs to be viewed in the context of the doorman, the mimicking of an openly gay man, that sets out his state of mind… “Mr Stokes’ behaviour outside the club set a clear tone for what happened that night… He took to acting in a provocative and offensive way.”  Bristol crown court heard that Ali told police he and Hale met the gay couple in the club earlier in the evening and “had their bottoms felt” by one of them but that it was light-hearted. However, the jury was told CCTV showed Mr Barry touch Ali “inappropriately” in the groin area, prompting him to push Mr Barry away. The court heard that shortly afterwards Stokes became involved in the apparent altercation with Ali and Hale, later saying he was coming to the defence of Mr Barry and Mr O’Connor. Student Max Wilson recorded the brawl on his phone. He said the group acted “like football hooligans”. Mr Corsellis said: “He did not believe the initial shove came from either Mr Stokes or Mr Hales, but later in the incident he described how Mr Stokes continued to behave in an aggressive manner, ignoring Mr Hales’ attempts to calm him down.” In Mr Wilson’s footage a man’s voice is heard shouting “enough, enough”. The court was told Ali was seen holding a bottle, raising it and motioning as if to hit Mr Hales, but then striking out at Mr Barry. Hale and Ali seemingly tried to retreat but Stokes began throwing punches while Mr Hales told him “that’s enough”, the court was told. Mr Corsellis added: “There’s a big difference between using violence to defend someone and… violence to retaliate or to punish the person who has had the temerity to attack you. “This is what you see from Mr Stokes… everyone except him wanted to stop. Mr Ali moved away, Mr Hales was saying ‘Stokes, Stokes, that’s enough’, and tried to get hold of him on two occasions to stop the violence. “This is retaliation, retribution, not self-defence.” The court heard that Hale said to Stokes “f***you”. Stokes then knocked him out and CCTV shows Hale on his back.  Mr Corsellis said: “[Stokes] then turned to Mr Ali who had no weapon on him, on to the second assault on the second man.” The court heard that Hale staggered to his feet, ran around the corner and levered a metal bar from a road sign, before racing back to the brawl, although it appears he never used it. Ali and Hale, both from Bristol, were treated in hospital. Hale had a 1.5-inch cut on his forehead. Stokes, from Castle Eden, Co Durham, had no obvious injuries except for a swollen hand. Following his arrest at the scene, Stokes said he acted in the way he did “because he was abusing my two friends for being gay”.

Matthew Scully-Hicks, 32, began adoption proceedings of daughter Elsie several years ago, along with his husband, Craig. A stay-at-home father, he went on to portray himself as the perfect parent, telling family and friends how in love he was with little Elsie. Pictures showed him playing the doting dad, cuddling, playing and waving with the youngster, with a huge smile on his face. Neighbours, friends and colleagues spoke warmly of Matthew, who appeared to be part of the very model of a modern, happy family. While Craig would go to work, he looked after their princess at their four-bedroom home in an upmarket area in Wales. But looks can be deceiving, Wales Online reports.  Just weeks after the formal adoption of Elsie went through, the baby was dead, murdered by father Matthew at just 18 months old. The part-time fitness instructor had completed the rigorous adoption process without a hitch, and without any concerns being raised. It looked like he, with Craig, could give Elsie the new start she needed. When the little girl was taken to hospital over the months before her death with injuries, medical staff accepted the explanations offered. However, there was something sinister and sad going on. Unable to cope with the demands of parenthood, 32-year-old Matthew was physically abusing his little daughter under the noses of professionals, family, friends, and even his husband. This was not a case where a family went under the radar of those in authority - they received regular visits from staff during the adoption process, health visitors would later call as they do with any new family, and medical staff would see Elsie at hospital.  But Matthew\u0027s subsequent trial, and a review by social services, would lay bare the terrible details of his daughter\u0027s short life. The painful reality is that the abuse of Elsie was hidden in plain sight. The lives of Elsie and Matthew began in very different places. She was taken into care shortly after birth because of concerns about her mother\u0027s drug use, while he was born into and grew up in a loving family. Without adoption, their lives would never have crossed. Elsie was placed with the couple in September 2015, and six months later the newly-formed family moved to a home in the upmarket Cardiff suburb of Llandaff. Matthew\u0027s husband, Craig, described how he had hoped to adopt a “Daddy’s little princess” and said Elsie was “great” apart from sleeping and at meal times. Elsie was physically tiny and delicate but had a “brash and bouncy” personality, he would later tell Cardiff Crown Court. A health visitor described her as “a very happy, smiley child” and said she was loving life, she was lovely - smiles all round.  Vivian Cownie, a former colleague of Matthew, would later describe him as a very proud father, a caring and loving father who would do anything for his child. On November 5 that year, Elsie suffered a leg injury, the first in a series of injuries she was to sustain. The infant was X-rayed on November 12 at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board Trauma and Orthopaedics Clinic and found to have broken her right tibia above her ankle. In fact, she had also suffered a second fracture of the leg - above her right knee - but that was not picked up until after her death. Matthew claimed he had been looking after her alone when he saw her fall while standing at an activity table in the kitchen. He claimed at various times that she may have fallen from standing or while pushing a walker, twisting her leg in the process. During his trial he would say that perhaps his daughter had been suffering from Vitamin D deficiency, or rickets, which could have made her more likely to suffer fractures.  A medical expert would tell the jury that he had never seen fractures of both bones like the ones suffered by Elsie in a child of her age, adding: “I have seen them in adults in more major traumas such as car accidents or falls from height.” Just a month after the leg fractures, Elsie suffered a horrific bruise to her face - a health visitor advised Matthew to seek medial treatment for the injury but he did not. Matthew claimed Elsie was pulling herself up on a toy kitchen, holding on to the doors when they opened and “she literally went face first down towards the edge” of the unit. The injury happened at the same time as an adoption review and Elsie was seen by her social worker, an adoption social worker and an independent reviewing officer - but the presence of the bruise was not recorded. Five days later, a health professional also saw the bruise but did pass on the information. By January 18, little Elsie had another bruise on her face, which again went unchecked by medics. But on March 10, 2016, Matthew did call for help - he rang 999 and said daughter had fallen down the stairs at their Wellwright Road home.  He told the call-handler she had vomited a number of times, and was now unresponsive. Elsie was rushed to hospital where her injuries were noted as being consistent with such a fall, and she was allowed home after four hours’ observation. Only one person knows precisely how the toddler came by those injuries over the months in her new home. To the outside world, Matthew presented as a loving and proud stay-at-home dad, and it seems no alarm bells were heard by those in a position to intervene. But in text messages to his husband, who was spending much of his time working away from home, he described Elsie as Satan dressed up in a Baby grow, a psycho and the exorcist. On May 12, 2016, Elsie was legally adopted by Craig and Matthew Scully-Hicks. The family was now formally complete. On May 25, Matthew took Elsie shopping for clothes to wear at a party to celebrate her adoption - he sent pictures of outfits at Marks \u0026amp Spencer to his husband, and bought one for her to wear.  But at 6.18pm that same day, he made a 999 call saying his daughter had collapsed. He told the operator: I was just changing my daughter for bed and she went all floppy and limp. When police and paramedics arrived at their home at 6.26pm, the 18-month-old was not breathing and was in cardiac arrest. Matthew claimed he had changed Elsie’s nappy on the rug in the living room, and had then taken her clothes and dirty nappy away - when he returned two or three minutes later, she was on the floor but was not breathing or moving. Elsie died in the University Hospital of Wales four days later. Tests revealed she had suffered three separate areas of bleeding on her brain, retinal bleeding, a skull fracture, and three broken ribs. South Wales Police launched an investigation. The truth of what happened to Elsie emerged during the subsequent four-week murder trial at Cardiff Crown Court. Matthew had murdered her, had assaulted and abused his daughter for seven months before violently shaking her and causing her catastrophic injury.  The jurors heard contrasting evidence of the fitness instructor’s warm, loving nature but also of the frustrated, angry tone of his text messages to his husband, and how he would scream at Elsie. They were also presented with a wealth of medical evidence. During the trial, they heard from consultant paediatrician Stephen Rose, who said it was likely that Elsie Scully-Hicks had been shaken violently and that her head had been rocked backwards and forwards so that her head was flexed down on to her chest and flexed backwards. He told the jury: This mechanism would then cause the subdural bleeding, or the bleeds around the brain, and the retinal haemorrhages and also it would cause her to stop breathing. Referring to the toddler\u0027s skull fracture, he said: There must have been a cause of the fracture skull fractures don’t occur spontaneously and so the only mechanism for a skull fracture is if there was a blow to the head, either during the shaking injury which culminated in Elsie being thrown against a hard floor, or possibly her head being knocked against a wall.  After four days of deliberations, the jury returned its verdict - Matthew was guilty of murdering his daughter. The defendant - who was dubbed a \u0027Jekyll and Hyde\u0027 character by a family court judge - was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. He must serve a minimum term of 18 years behind bars. Sentencing Matthew, Mrs Justice Davies described Elsie as a young, vulnerable and defenceless child whom the defendant had previously injured. She said: In deliberately inflicting serious injuries upon your 18-month-old adoptive daughter you abused the trust which had been placed in you as Elsie’s adoptive father. It was a gross abuse of that trust. It was an abuse of the responsibility which had been placed upon you as her adoptive father to protect and care for this young, vulnerable and defenceless child. Your actions in killing Elsie have devastated three families – the birth family of Elsie, the family you had sought to build with Craig Scully-Hicks and your own birth family. You were living in comfortable social circumstances with the close support of professional agencies, your husband and wider family.  To those who saw you regularly, be it healthcare professionals, social workers or friends and family you were a loving and caring father. She added: To no one, not even your husband, did you have the courage to speak of your difficulties. You put your own self-interest before that of the young child you had been entrusted to protect. In separate family court proceedings conducted before the trial but only reveled afterwards, it emerged that a judge had completely exonerated Matthew\u0027s husband Craig of any failure to protect Elsie. Speaking after the trial, Elsie’s birth grandmother, Sian O’Brien, revealed the anguish of the family. She accepted that at the time of giving birth, her daughter was living a chaotic lifestyle and was not in a position to care for her baby. But she said the family continued to have contact with the child - originally named Shayla O\u0027Brien - while she was in the care of the foster family. And she said that in January 2015 she had started proceedings in the family court to become her legal . The grandmother said: We all continue to fight on even though every day we are numb with pain and hurt deep in the knowledge that Shayla was loved unconditionally by us all as a family and knowing that had she not been taken away from us, she would still be alive today.  Despite this decision and Shayla being in foster care, we as a family were still able to have weekly contact with her and we saw her without fail at every opportunity. In August 2015, out of nowhere, we were told by social services that we had to go and see Shayla as soon as possible and say goodbye for the final time as a suitable adoptive family had been found for her. This was completely devastating for us all. She added: A person who had been deemed by the authorities to be a fit and proper person to bring up my granddaughter was responsible for her death, and they took her from me telling me I would be unable to cope. Following the death of Elsie, a child practice review undertaken by Cardiff and Vale Regional Child Safeguarding Board found professionals saw the youngster\u0027s injuries in isolation, lacked professional curiosity and accepted the explanations given by Matthew. The report said that Matthew and his partner presented as a well-educated and articulate couple and very positive parents for this child. As a result, there was a lack of professional curiosity regarding the child’s experiences and injuries. The report said the professionals involved in the case viewed the adoptive placement as being very successful, and it criticised the recording of incidents and communication between agencies claiming no one agency held all the relevant information on this child.

Today our first motorway is better known for its jams, long delays and stressful journeys as 300,000 cars squeeze on to its 193 miles every day. But the M1, which links London with Leeds, is about to turn 60. So a TV documentary has lifted the lid on this iconic north-south route. Here we journey through its history, picking up fascinating facts along the way...   PLANS  A nationwide motorway network was discussed as early as 1923 but the Second World War and cash shortages meant it only got the go-ahead in the 1950s. The first motorway section was the eight mile Preston bypass (now part of the M6), opened in 1958. But three years earlier, Sir Owen Williams, who designed the old Wembley, was asked to deliver the first part of the ambitious M1, a 54-mile stretch linking Watford (Junction 5) with Crick/Rugby (J18).   CONSTRUCTION  Digging started in 1957 but Williams changed the design from two lanes to three. There were 132 futuristic bridges but no crash barriers, central reservation or lighting. It was one of the biggest projects the country had seen yet Sir Owen brought it in on time, 19 months later, and on its budget of \u0026pound16m. Architectural critic Jonathan Glancey said: “They were building a national road for the first time since the Romans – with incredible speed. “It was a mile every eight days and a bridge every three days.” (When 14 miles was made four lanes in 2009 it took three years.) Some 5,000 workers shifted 20 million tonnes of earth and rock.  OPENING  Transport Secretary Ernest Marples opened the M1 on November 2, 1959, but seemed horrified by the speed of the traffic, muttering: “My God, what have I started?” His speech warned that “the speed is so great the senses may be numbed and judgment warped”. That was because the M1 had no speed limit. Ex- traffic cop Les Barker, who patrolled from day one, said: “It was designated a ‘special road’ and free of speed restrictions. So all hell let loose.”   MOTORWAY MADNESS  Cars were hurtling along at more than 100mph yet families would stop on the hard shoulder to picnic, stroll or snooze. The unofficial M1 speed record was set in April 1964 on a stretch near Northampton. The AC Cobra was due to race in the Le Mans 24 hour and the weekend before, in the early hours of the morning, its drivers opened up the throttle near Watford Gap services. They hit 185mph, sparking a police probe and a front page Daily Mirror story. In 1965 the 70mph limit was trialled and went nationwide in 1967. Congestion means the average M1 speed today is just 47.5mph.  BREAKDOWNS  While drivers got the speed bug their cars weren’t used to doing over 50mph and many overheated. On day one, out of 13,000 vehicles, 100 broke down in the first 10 miles. The first AA trucks had rubber bumpers to push vehicles to safety and mechanics had unusual ways to alert cars to hazards. One AA man said: “I’d tip petrol on rags, set fire to it and throw it into the road. When the rags had been used up I used to throw the rest of the petrol across the motorway and set fire to it. “But it didn’t stop all of them – they’d go through the flames into the cars in the accident.”  TRADE  The M1 proved a huge boost to firms and the majority of freight moved off the railways on to motorways. Today, almost everything we buy travels by motorway. On an average Wednesday truckers will drive one million miles in 24 hours on the M1.   SERVICE STATIONS  There are 14 service stations and in the 1960s they were considered the height of sophistication. People would travel to them especially for a meal out and some even had silver service restaurants. Watford Gap’s Blue Boar services became a hotspot for the music stars of the Swinging 60s, with bands on tour stopping to meet up. The Beatles, The Hollies and The Rolling Stones were all regulars and pop mags told fans it was “the place where you can meet the stars for the price of a cup of tea”. When Jimi Hendrix first came to London he thought the Blue Boar was a nightclub where he should play.  SIGNS  In 1958 graphic designers Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert revamped road signs in readiness for the motorway era. Old signs varied widely and were in capital letters – hard to read on the move. Kinneir and Calvert rigorously tested type sizes and styles, colours and backgrounds. Their designs were three times bigger than old ones. Those signs are still used today and are considered design classics.  ACCIDENTS \u0026amp CLOSURES  In 1958 there were 4.5 million cars compared to 28 million today but there were twice as many fatalities on early motorways as there are today. In March 1972 nine people died when 200 vehicles crashed in thick fog on the M1 near Luton. The M1 has also been shut due to bomb scares, movie filming, fires and extreme weather.

Adorable Scarlett Evered gets stopped by strangers wherever she goes. She was signed up by a lookalike agency when she was just 15 months old after her grandma noticed she bears a striking resemblance to the fourth in line to the throne. The tot has so far starred in three supermarket campaigns, modelled dressing gowns and even got to open up a winter wonderland with other royal lookalikes. Her mum Victoria Evered, 38, said the pair constantly get stopped by strangers commenting on how much her tot looks like the three-year-old royal. Victoria, of Orpington, Kent, said: “When Princess Charlotte turned one there was an OK magazine feature with lots of pictures and my mum said Scarlett looked just like her.  “Mum said ‘why don’t you see if she could be a lookalike’. I sent Scarlett’s picture to a lookalike agency and she was working that weekend. “Her first job was for a viral video campaign for Asda when she was 15 months old to mark the Queen’s 90th birthday. “It was amazing. There were lookalikes for Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. She loved every minute of it. “They were filming so the director was keeping them separate but people were walking past and doing a double take. It was hilarious. “It had millions of views on their social media platforms. It was so surreal. “I thought that would be it and it would be a one off but then that summer she was asked to do another one.” The mum of three, who also has sons Harrison Evered, 10, and Nathan Evered, seven, with her finance consultant husband Andrew Evered, 40, said ‘diva’ Scarlett loves the attention. Victoria said: “There was an open day at my son’s school and his teacher came up and said ‘do you know who she’s the exact double of?’ “People comment on it all the time. You’ll be in the supermarket and people come up and say she looks just like her.  “Quite often I’ll see people smiling at me and I know what they’re going to say. I’ve not had anyone think I’ve actually stolen the princess though – thank God. “It happens especially if her hair is down because the parting falls in a similar way to Princess Charlotte’s. “Scarlett’s taken to saying ‘I’m not Princess Charlotte, I’m Scarlett’. And as she gets older she’s becoming much more aware of it. “When we’re out and about and people say it she laughs and smiles. She does love the attention.” Scarlett, who is now signed with three agencies - Scarlett Entertainment, Susan Scott and Lookalikes - did three viral videos for Asda in 2016. The toddler also appeared in a video for Pizza Express to mark Prince George’s third birthday. Stay-at-home mum Victoria also entered her into a Netvouchercodes competition to find the best lookalike which she won in April 2017. Scarlett was then asked to open up a Christmas fairground at a Dreamland event in Margate, Kent, last year with Prince William lookalike Simon Watkinson and Duchess of Cambridge lookalike Heidi Agan.  Victoria said: “It was lovely for her. She got to walk around the park and meet Father Christmas and got to go ice skating before everybody else arrived. “They took pictures of her with the other lookalikes on the ice rink then people were coming over to speak to her. “She loved it. She’s a very sociable, friendly, outgoing little girl and it comes very naturally to her. “This year to mark the birth of the royal baby she did a campaign for My 1st Years’ Royal Collection. That was her first modelling campaign and she really took to it.  “They were in their dressing gowns being babysat by a Meghan Markle lookalike which got a lot of coverage in magazines and papers. “It was because Prince George wore one of those dressing gowns when he met President Obama. “She was brilliant. She knows Hayden (Ursell) who plays Prince George really well and the other lookalikes are always really professional. “It doesn’t seem like she’s doing any work. She’s just having fun.” Spending time around so many royal doppelgangers – and being one – does sometimes leave Scarlett confused. The little girl has been known to think she’s watching herself on TV when she’s actually watching the princess.  Victoria said: “I always show her Princess Charlotte on the television and a couple of times she’s thought it’s actually her. “When the royal baby was born she thought she was watching Simon who is the Prince William lookalike. “Scarlett has got lighter hair and a different eye colour. She’s not exactly the same but they definitely have some sort of resemblance. “Scarlett does like Princess Charlotte. She always looks at her dresses and what she’s wearing. I think she’d be happy to copy her clothes. “I’ll be over the moon if she can continue to do it. We have a lovely memory book of all her press cuttings so that she can see it when she’s older.

Kirsten Ashby was left with no finger tips, no ears and layers of her skin on her face melted away. The 27-year-old\u0027s injuries were so severe her face was left unrecognisable from the third degree burns, which she said made her feel like a monster as people stare at her in the street. Kirsten said she nearly died in hospital, until she saw her daughter Madison, nine, in a dream while she was in an induced coma. She came out of the coma after four weeks - but she still wasn\u0027t allowed to see nine-year-old Maddison for a few more weeks - and when she did her little girl was too scared to touch her.  She told TalkRadio: She kept on looking at my hands, my arms and my skin. So I said to her, \u0027Do you want to stroke my arm? It feels like a lizard.\u0027 At first she was, \u0027No, no, no.\u0027 She was afraid of hurting me. It took her a couple of visits. Kirsten had been drinking wine with friend Lauren Russell on November 17 last year when Lauren felt unwell. Kirsten tried to help by calling an ambulance but Lauren\u0027s boyfriend Raymond Bowen reacted by throwing petrol over her.  Kirsten said he stood smoking a cigarette as he lit the flammable liquid with a lighter and looked smug as she was set ablaze. Bowen was jailed for 19 years over the attack in April which was extended to life by the Court of Appeal because the sentence was considered too lenient . Recalling the horror, Kirsten added: I was running my hands through my hair, trying to get the fire out. Then I just remember falling down on my knees. I couldn\u0027t run out of the door to get water because the two kids were standing there. \u0027And I couldn\u0027t run to the other side of the room because he had spilled alcohol over the floor. If I\u0027d have been there the whole flat could have gone up.   The next time she opened her eyes she saw her neighbours and two big yellow blobs - which were actually policemen. She didn\u0027t wake up again until she was in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. She didn\u0027t recognise herself when she eventually looked in the mirror. It was awful but I kind of shut off, she said. I\u0027m quite numb to it. So I\u0027m sure that I\u0027ve still got quite a lot of emotion to go through. After 11 weeks she was able to see her daughter, but it wasn\u0027t until May that she could leave the hospital to live with her parents Lynn and Paul Ashby and Madison at their home in Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire  She has had to have several operations to start rebuilding her face and body since the horror attack and has been left feeling itchy and emotionally numb. She said she has suffered burns to her hands, arms, chest, half of her back and her face. She has had to have skin grafts taken from both of her legs to replace the skin, which has left her in a lot of pain and in and out of bandages as her skin keeps breaking down. She says children and adult stare at her now, but she has bravely learnt to live with it. Her parents previously said they were told to expect the worst as she was not expected to survive the horrific ordeal. They described her as a stubborn soul and her recovery, much of which had been in isolation due to the risk of contracting an infection, was a slow and painful process. Mrs Ashby said she was kept in bandages from head to toe as skin had been taken from other areas of her body in a bid to graft onto her face and torso.

At least two people were killed and up to 70 injured - 14 of them seriously - in the horror incident on a bridge near Bologna, Italy .  The powerful blast destroyed part of the bridge and ripped the tanker in two before the burning wreckage crashed onto several cars below. The moment it erupted near Bologna Airport was caught by a driver who had been filming the aftermath of the crash just a few metres away.  Plumes of thick black smoke can be seen coming from the crash site where several vehicles are backed-up nearby. Suddenly the tanker bursts into flames, with the impact shaking the car and leaving the driver clearly scared for their life as they jerk backwards in shock. The tanker erupted moments after crashing into a car transporter in Borgo Panigale at 2pm local time (1pm BST) in the north Italian region.  A massive plume of smoke was visible for miles as emergency services rushed to the scene to treat the injured and extinguish the inferno. After the tanker collapsed off the bridge the blaze spread to several cars that are believed to belong to Peugeot and Citroen. The vehicles then also exploded, smashing out windows and sending debris flying into passersby leaving several people hurt.

These boys you admire and we’re all fishing in the same pond.“There is a bit of time.

So does Matej and it’s been a good relationship.“Along with Neil Alexander, our coach, we have a goalie union and it is a fun working environment.“At the end of the day we all support each other and, whoever plays, that continues.“It’s good competition and it’s good for the team.“We prepare in training and whoever is picked, they will do their best. This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new striker adil nabi in dundee squad for st mirren opener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew signing Adil Nabi goes straight into the Dundee squad for today\u0026#8217s Premiership opener at St Mirren.The 24-year-old will likely have to settle for a place on the bench, however.Coming back into the team will be star midfielder Glen Kamara after he shrugged off an ankle injury picked up in training last week.The Finnish international missed wins at Peterhead and home to Brechin but is expected to return.Striker Sofien Moussa, too, is expected to have got over his rib injury he suffered against Dunfermline.The Tunisian was given painkilling injections to get through the game at Balmoor but wasn’t able to play against Brechin.There are still question marks over the fitness of central defender Genseric Kusunga.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"only five players remain from when mccann took charge but dundee far from the finished article","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than a year into the job and with plenty of players in and out, Dundee boss Neil McCann is beginning to feel this squad is his own, though he admits they’re “far from the finished article”.Only five first-team players remain since Neil took the reins at Dens Park in June 2017 – Cammy Kerr, Darren O’Dea, Paul McGowan, Jesse Curran and Craig Wighton.After two summer windows – still four weeks to go in the current one – and a winter transfer period, it’s clear the Dens gaffer has put his own stamp on the side, though he admits he’s still got work to do on that front.He said: “The squad has evolved since I came in.“A lot of those boys that were here when I came in served me great.“When I’ve asked them to come in and do a job, they gave me everything but a lot of those boys have decided, when they’re not featuring regularly, they want to move on, and have.“I’m still looking to bring in some more but I’m pleased with the group I have just now.“You want to mould a team and how it wants to play and it has to be your team – there’s no point coming in and trying to use the previous manager’s ideas and ways he wants to play, it has to be your own.“I’m getting to the stage where I’m seeing things coming, but we need to bolt lots together because we’re far from the finished article.”Neil has been clear in his pursuit of further options at left-back and up front.Former Morton defender Mark Russell is in on trial along with former West Brom forward Adil Nabi.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":null,"title":"2018-european-championships-cycling-trial-glasgow-road-closures-in-place","story":"                          THOUSANDS of drivers and commuters are being warned to rethink travel plans ahead of a cycling event which will bring major roads to a standstill."},{"url":null,"title":"how-much-scots-workers-lost-in-unclaimed-expenses-last-year","story":"                          BRITISH workers have collectively lost out on a staggering \u0026pound962 million in unclaimed expense in the last year."},{"url":null,"title":"man-who-cant-stop-buying-things-when-he-is-asleep-feels-positive-after-making-condition-public","story":"                          A MAN with a brain disorder that sees him spend hundreds of pounds on \u0026ldquouseless shopping while he\u0027 asleep has told how he is feeling much more positive after making his condition public."},{"url":null,"title":"worried-residents-see-red-over-bid-to-build-on-greenbelt-in-neilston","story":"                          CONCERNED residents have launched a bid to prevent more than 100 homes being built on a much-loved field in Neilston."},{"url":null,"title":"serco-to-pause-lock-change-notices-for-asylum-seekers","story":"                          Serco has announced it will pause plans to issue lock-change orders to tenants whose application for asylum has been refused ahead of a court challenge."},{"url":null,"title":"olivier-ntcham-boost-for-celtic-as-tom-rogic-insists-celtic-have-enough-to-cope-with-aek-athens","story":"                          Celtic are cautiously optimistic that Olivier Ntcham will be fit to\u0026nbspfeature against Greek side AEK Athens on Wednesday night.

Aberdeen.Journalists yesterday started work at the new Aberdeen Journals headquarters inside the Marischal Square development.The move from the Lang Stracht back into the city centre is a historic one for the Evening Express and our sister paper The Press and Journal.From 1894 until 1970 the newspapers were based in Broad Street, on the site of the current council chambers.Journalists from the Evening Express and P\u0026ampJ made the move over the weekend and in the coming weeks other departments will leave the Mastrick building for the £107 million state-of-the-art development.As well as moving our offices back to the city centre, readers will also be able to place notices, pay for ads, buy merchandise and book holidays at a new Aberdeen Journals shop opening soon on Upperkirkgate.Aberdeen Journals – part of DC Thomson Media – has taken residence of the top floor of 1 Marischal Square, which will be home to more than 200 staff from editorial, digital, advertising, newspaper sales, marketing and commercial.Mike Watson, chief executive Officer of DC Thomson Media, said: “We’re thrilled to be moving the Aberdeen team into state-of-the-art office space in the heart of the city.“This move will provide the teams with a brilliant environment to work in, just a stone’s throw from the old Aberdeen Journals office on Broad Street.“Our investment in this space cements our commitment to Aberdeen and the papers that serve the city.”Alan McCabe, editor-in-chief at DC Thomson evening newspapers, said: “We’re delighted to be producing the Evening Express and The Press and Journal from our fantastic new home in the heart of Aberdeen.“Virtually everyone who has set foot in the new office has been bowled over and that’s down to the vision and hard work of Fiona Adam and her team at Covell Matthews and the fit-out team at Transform who’ve done an outstanding job, designing and creating such an amazing space for us.“We wanted somewhere that would inspire our teams and reflect the way Aberdeen Journals has changed from a traditional publisher to a modern, multimedia company – and we couldn’t be happier with the end result.”The offices have been fitted out in sleek contemporary style with quirky touches such as meeting booths fitted out as train carriages.Project architect Fiona Adam said: “The long history of the Journals in the north-east afforded us excellent design opportunities to include local references within the artwork timeline of Fittie, Dunnottar and Balmoral Castles and footballing legend Willie Miller.“Covell Matthews Architects have been delighted to have been involved in the delivery of the new office for Aberdeen Journals. It has been a hugely enjoyable and fun project working with such a terrific client, contractor and design team.”Other companies which have already moved into the building include Mackie’s, Costa, All Bar One and Marriott International, Tony Macaroni and Prezzo.Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland will also make the move from its current home in the West End to Marischal Square this month.NHS National Services Scotland began talks in April to fit out part of the fourth floor of 1 Marischal Square.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/5b026386b2dc8-940x528.jpg ","title":"public to name new space","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTime is running out for people to have their say on the new name for an Aberdeen community hub.Aberdeen City Council has organised a competition to name the new Tillydrone Hub Operational Group’s community space and rooms within it.The council is reaching out to community members for ideas on what should be hidden as part of a time capsule burial.Work on the £6 million project on Hayton Road is under way and will bring together a range of services including a library, creche, IT area, cafe, retail space and a business start-up.Foundations for the new project were laid at an event on April 23, marking the start of construction for the state-of-the-art hub.

Apart from the technical information, which went a little over my head, it felt the same as before. The ground is uniformed, neat and tidy and it is so peaceful you feel like you are soaring in the air. It was simply stunning.”With nerves of steel, Chris piloted the plane and even had a back seat passenger, daughter Lesley.Lesley, 54, who works as a receptionist at Saks Hair \u0026amp Beauty in Union Square, said: “I knew my mum would definitely go for it and I was more than happy to go up with her then and will be happy to do so again.”Flying instructor Bill Anderson, who operates with Buchan Aero Club, declared Chris had “the knack” and she received hundreds of likes on daughter Lesley’s social media page for her efforts.So will Chris be seeking out her pilot licence anytime soon?“No,” she exclaimed. “But I can’t wait for my next lesson.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b63f4096fedf-846x564.jpg ","title":"students are driving force at legendary silverstone","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university motorsport team has raced its way to take 9th place in a prestigious competition.TAU Racing, run by Aberdeen University students, took home the accolade at an international competition held at the historic Silverstone race track in Towcester, home of the Formula One British Grand Prix.TAU, along with other teams from across the world including America and Europe, took to the track at Silverstone for the Formula Student UK event, celebrating the weekend’s 20th anniversary.Arran Strutt, the 21-year-old project manager, said: “We’re absolutely ecstatic to have placed where we did, especially given the obstacles put in front of us.“We worked out that it took our 60 members a total of 11,000 hours to put this car together from the ground up.”The cars themselves, which cost TAU between £20,000 and £30,000, are built and rebuilt from scratch every year, using the knowledge of the students.Arran admits that some of the pricier parts may be kept, but the majority is all brand new.He said: “Each car is built from scratch. We manufacture the chassis ourself, and fully design the car from the ground up.“Sometimes we might even use systems that we’ve designed as part of our course.“Things are held over, in terms of expensive components, but the whole design is fresh.”The team overcame a setback on its Aberdeenshire test track to take part in the competition, which took place between July 13 and 15. The day before the competition, during test laps, a wheel assembly collapsed, prompting the skeleton crew to replace it with one used on a previous car.Arran said: “It was a very tense atmosphere, we had a skeleton crew of about five or six there, and it took a really big push to get everything sorted.“It’s fair to say that they all did a great job.”Far from being an engineering-only event, Arran also spoke of how multi-faceted the competition is, with each team having to submit a business case, including costings to judges, as well as securing sponsors to cover the costs of the car.The mechanical engineering student said: “We have business students as part of the team, who are tasked with putting together a business case, as if we were going to mass produce the car.”Arran also mentioned the positive impact the team has on students.He said: “There’s a huge student development side.“Engineering students can apply theoretical knowledge that you learn in class on to the car, and you can learn other skills that you might not, like the manufacturing side.”Professor Igor Guz, head of the university’s school of engineering, said: “I am delighted that TAU Racing has achieved another great result in this year’s Formula Student competition. The result is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the team, and demonstrates the opportunities open to students when they come to study at one of the UK’s top universities for engineering.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b6150949115d.jpg ","title":"cooper waits on smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tInverurie Locos boss Neil Cooper is hopeful a knee injury to new signing Jonny Smith is not too serious.The striker had to be stretchered off in the first half of Saturday’s 6-1 win over Huntly at Harlaw Park.Cooper said: “Jonny took a knock early on to a knee and had to be stretchered off.“We’ll have to wait and see how serious it is, we’re hopeful it’s not too serious and we’re keeping our fingers crossed, but we’re not sure.”The Railwaymen fell behind to a Michael Clark goal, but Joe McCabe’s strike, Neil Gauld’s hat-trick and efforts from Stuart Duff and Chris Angus made it 6-1.The Black and Golds responded with Clark and Gary McGowan netting and Kai Ross being red carded.Cooper added: “It was a good three points and probably a fair reflection.“Huntly started better and went ahead, but we came back.“We were disappointed to concede at 6-1, we were a bit sloppy.“That was the frustrating thing for us.“But it’s great to follow up the win against Buckie last week with another three points.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"talented mojo line up announced","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/07/18, 11:51 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 MOJO line-up has been announced.Organisers met recently to choose all the acts \u0026#8211 and it was not an easy decision,  following a large response that highlighted so much talent.And due to the fantastic response, the line-up this year is bigger than before, including one act from last year with hot new material.Some of the musicians who did not make it onto the line-up can be heard between acts, with organisers playing their demo tracks between bands.The acts making the final line-up for Craignish Village Hall, Ardfern on Saturday October 20 are:\u0026#8211 Liam Sommerville\u0026#8211 Stephen Skinn\u0026#8211 The Brambelles\u0026#8211 Citizen 9\u0026#8211 The Hollow Mountain String Band\u0026#8211 4 BelowFull details of the MOJO event will be coming soon and tickets will be available from September 1.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll authors sweep the shelves","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 29/07/18, 12:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTwo authors based in Argyll have released new books.Sue Douglas of Taynuilt and Jennifer Campbell from Lochgilphead have shared their talents with the world, with the release of a book each this week.Career author Sue Douglas’ contemporary romance \u0026#8216If You Can’t Trust the Living\u0026#8217 and novice Jennifer Campbell’s children\u0026#8217s story \u0026#8216Edwin the Wee Elf\u0026#8217 are available online and in good bookshops.To escape unwarranted and adverse media attention, Robin Tyler rents a house in Cushlow Close, a family-owned development of four properties in a remote location.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers.

The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning. The morning after, the focus moved to Tayvallich village pontoon for the world crab fishing championship.There are now 12 months of peace for people, pooches and partan until the next Tayvallich Weekend on July 26-28 next year.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soaked campbeltown cyclist raised charity cash","story":"\t\tMark DaveyUpdated: 06/08/18, 4:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Campbeltown peddaller joined an Argyll peloton for this years RideLondon 100 event.The eight week London heat wave came to an abrupt end just in time for the  cycling quartet to take to the roads.Campbeltown cyclist Marjorie Leighton had enthused so much after taking part last year, that she encouraged three Mid Argyll friends Morag MacNicol, Catriona Crawford and Iain MacNicol to participate in this year\u0026#8217s challenge.The day before the event, the air temperature had soared to 32°C and the cyclists prepared for the possibilty of heat exhaustion.However on the day, they were shocked to find that they should have perhaps brought cyling capes instead.The persistent rain combined with the wind ensured that they were all soaked to the skin at the finish.The Argyll cyclists beat the target required for their chosen charity, Bloodwise (formerly Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research) which helps to fund research for specific types of cancer.This charity was selected, due to each of the participants having some experience with cancer.The cyclists said:\u0026#8217 We would like to thank all persons who have donated so far for this very worthwhile cause.\u0026#8217They have currently raised approximately £3,000 and will keep the JustGiving page open until the end of August should anyone wish to donate.  https://justgiving/fundraising/morag-macnicolFor more cycling news see pages 20 and 21.Marjorie Leighton, Morag MacNicol, Catriona Crawford and Iain MacNicol in Green Park.

Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them. And it has to be root and branch – every correspondence, every conversation, every e-mail – involving everyone from the Malaysian owners to our own Council executives and elected members. The council tax payers of South Ayrshire deserve the truth. And they certainly deserve better management of local resources than this current shambles .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentTaxesAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland.

But vehicles needing access to Old Cumnock Old Church for weddings or funerals will continue to have access. These vehicles will have to show a permit to access The Square. Any other vehicles will be hit by a fixed-penalty notice if they flout the new traffic regulations. The move is designed to improve safety to pedestrians and cyclists in the Square. One community councillor said it would stop parking outside the hairdressers and takeaways at the Square: “Traffic in the Square will be limited,” he added. “From the beginning of August anyone driving a car would need to have a permit. “It will be limited to funeral cars, wedding cars for church services “The main thing is they are going to block off pedestrian crossing outside the Royal Hotel. “So the cars are going to have to come in and go back out into Lugar Street. “It is going to be mayhem in Lugar Street. “I suggested reversing the one way system at Hamilton Place and make it street pedestrian only.” Another community councillor asked how it would be implemented. He added: “Who is going to patrol it? “Will it be police or traffic wardens. “I haven’t seen police in the square.” Stewart Turner, head of road at Ayrshire Roads Alliance, said: “Access to The Square will be limited to vehicles directly associated with wedding and funeral operations at Old Cumnock Old Church. “These vehicles will be required to display a permit to access The Square. Permits are available free of charge from the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. “We have contacted several wedding and funeral operators in the immediate area and advised of this requirement. “Exemptions to the access restriction include vehicles engaged in building work, road repairs, utility repairs, postal delivery, cash collection, furniture removal operations and the emergency services. “The Square will also have waiting and loading restrictions in force at all times. This will enable a Parking Attendant employed by the Council to issue a Penalty Charge Notice to any vehicle within The Square contravening the restrictions.  “Exemptions to the waiting  and loading restrictions are exactly the same as the access restriction.  “I do not anticipate traffic congestion on Lugar Street as a result of this Order. “The Order was promoted to prevent danger to pedestrians and cyclists in The Square. “The Order was advertised on Wednesday March 28 and received no objections. “The Order is fully supported by Police Scotland and they will be responsible for enforcing the restrictions.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPolice ScotlandCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-borders-council-to-mark-merchant-navy-day","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council is to host a special reception to honour the services of Merchant Navy personnel.\nAnd Borderers who have previously or currently serve are being asked to come forward to attend the event.\nMerchant Navy Day is held on September 3 every year to honour the brave men and women who kept Britain afloat during both World Wars, and also celebrate the importance of modern day merchant seafarers.\nA civic reception will be held on the same day at Newtown St Boswells to mark the occasion.\nCouncil convener, Councillor David Parker, said: \u0026ldquoThe Merchant Navy was given its name 100 years ago at the end of World War I, with King George V acknowledging their efforts in providing supplies to Britain.\n\u0026ldquoWith this special anniversary, we felt it was appropriate to mark the efforts of our local personnel and would request any Borders seafarers to get in contact with us so we can invite you to the reception.\nAny Merchant Navy personnel from the Borders wishing to go should email CorporateMgtSupport@scotborders.gov.uk or phone 01835 826571 or contact councillor Sandy Aitchison \u0026ndash saitchison@scotborders.gov.uk.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work. Miss Jane Fergusson executed some remarkable wood carvings in St Andrew\u0026rsquos church and was instrumental in forming a local branch of the Band of Mercy.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-actor-lands-starring-role-in-theatre-royal-programme","story":"ACTORS from across the UK applied in their hundreds for the highly-regarded Theatre Royal education programme.\nAnd following a demanding audition process, one budding thespian from Melrose landed one of the 18 starring roles.\nAlexander Cowan will now embark on a year-long course of mentoring by top industry professionals, which in the past has included Royal Shakespeare Company voice coach Michael Corbridge and Ros Steen, the former head of vocal training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.\nSome of the acting world\u0026rsquos most famous names have trodden the boards at Newcastle\u0027s Theatre Royal including Dame Judy Dench and Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.\nAlexander is delighted to be joining them.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

This year it was reprinted by Comely Bank Publishing as Russain Doll.In a strange synchronicity, at virtually the same time as last week’s talk, former SNP leader and MP Alex Salmond, who now broadcasts for Russian television, was dumped as a potential chairman by the investor trying to takeover Johnston Press.Drawing on her own seven years BBC radio experience, Ms Lloyd’s heroine, Anna, is a radio producer at the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation as it has been renamed after independence.The book’s blurb states: ‘In an independent Scotland, Russia attempts a soft occupation under the noses of the novice government.‘Against her best intentions, she finds herself falling for a Russian diplomat tasked with delivering Scotland into Moscow’s hands.‘As war looms, will this relationship save, or destroy, Anna?’Ms Lloyd, a scientist, runner and skier says she was on the river or pitch more than in a lab.This description fits Anna who is often described as ‘out for a run’ and Ms Lloyd says is: ‘Feisty, smart, sporty and spouting opinions.’‘When I wrote the book, the Brexit vote had not happened and Donald Trump was a bad television games show host,’ said Ms Lloyd. ‘It was written before the concept of fake news.‘It is more of a love story than a political novel. I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonia way cycling companion guidebook","story":"A comprehensive pedaling plan to the cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness was published last week.The 118 page handlebar bag sized spiral bound book, to guide cyclists on National Cycle Route 78, is so far available at Machrihanish Holiday Park, Patersons Bakery Carradale, Skipness Smokehouse and Argyll Backpackers at Inverneil.Independent publishers, The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Janet Moss and Pete Martin, visited Campbeltown last Thursday, from their Cumbria base, to launch the book\u0026#8217s first edition.It was the pair\u0026#8217s second visit since May when they put finishing touches to the production which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey maps of each section, a comprehensive accommodation guide and locations where cycle spares might be found.\u0026#8216We have cycled the route at least once in both directions although much of the research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat. For instance in Campbeltown Amelias, Food for Thought and Ceann Loch Diner are excluded.Neither of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s fish and chip shops are included, either in the listings or on the map, despite there being a map symbol for those takeaways.Many cyclists are inquisitive and will no doubt discover other options as the guide is just a starting point.The Caledonia Way may also appeal to motorised travellers as well as the self propelled.A separate concertina trip planner leaflet, inserted at the back of the book, shows a height cross section of the full route and is cross referenced to the accommodation providers.On the reverse of this route planner is a diagrammatic map, trip planning tool and mileage chart including a speech bubble stating: \u0026#8216Are there any more hills today.\u0026#8217The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Pete Martin and Janet Moss with their guidebook at the Campbeltown launch. 25_c31caledonia01_PeteMartin_Janet_Moss\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane august 3 2018","story":"In the days before rapid transatlantic flights, The Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Queen Elizabeth operated a weekly luxury liner service between Southampton and New York.A phone call, to the Southampton ferry and tug company Red Funnel, started a huge and challenging recovery exercise to refloat the 83,000 ton liner from the Bramble Bank.Tugs Canute, Clausentum, Neptune and Vulcan and Alexandra Towing Company\u0026#8217s Romey, Hornby and Poulsom were sent but soon it was realised more would be needed.Last week down memory lane featured the Royal Navy tug HMRT Bustler, a model of which is in Campbeltown museum.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Her dad Stan mounted the first major expedition to the caves, in the Andes Mountains in the east of the country, alongside astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1976.  Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Eileen, who was born in the country\u0026rsquos capital Quito, moved to Dunbar in 1997, with mum Janeth working in Cherrytrees Nursery.  A small display of Ecuadorian items has been created in BeGreen Dunbar\u0026rsquos shop window on High Street as part of the donation campaign to fund the trip.  The former Dunbar Primary School and Dunbar Grammar School pupil, who co-founded The Open Close Collective \u0026ndash a group of artists, architects, musicians, scientists and makers \u0026ndash has visited the caves twice before.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.

Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation the local authority announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year stating \"the majority of respondents said that they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the Library building.\"  However the council has now said that following a service review\u0026nbspit will move a wide range of services into the library from Monday, August 27.

Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \"As more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.\u0026nbsp  \"Meanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint Library/Area Office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"chernobyl-children-enjoy-a-special-pets-experience","story":"  The Ormiston-based organisation has been working with the Chernobyl Children\u0026rsquos Lifeline Trust and Swiis Foster Care to provide youngsters from Belarus with a special workshop as they visited the UK as part of a month-long recuperative holiday provided each year.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.

And it also reveals that politeness is alive and well, with \u0026ldquoPlease and \u0026ldquoThank you the most common words learned by holidaymakers (72%).  In addition, more than two-thirds (69%) learnt to say \u0026ldquoHello and \u0026ldquoGoodbye, while 28% learned the phrase \u0026ldquoHow much does it cost?  But there are also signs that many Britons are simply learning how to express their lack of foreign language skills, with more than one in four (28%) teaching themselves to say \u0026ldquoDo you speak English? and 16% saying they learnt to say: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sorry, I don\u0026rsquot speak the language.  Just over a fifth (21%) said they did not learn any words or phrases.  The poll, which questioned almost 2,000 people, also suggests that the days of riffling through the phrasebook are long gone for many younger Britons, with 60% of 16 to 34-year-olds saying they have used smartphones and apps to help understand the local language, while 39% have used a phrasebook.  In total, 42% of those polled said they had taken a phrasebook abroad with them to help them understand the local language, while more than a third (36%) had used their phone.  And while over half (59%) agreed that translation technology is a useful tool for making the most out of your holiday, just over one in 10 (11%) said they have misunderstood the local language due to an inaccurate translation.  Nearly three in four (73%) agreed that it is important to learn a few phrases in the local language.  Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos fantastic that so many of us are ready to give foreign languages a go to make the most of our holidays, and smartphone technology can be a great first step in getting directions and finding out basic information.  \u0026ldquoHowever, this technology has its limits and can\u0026rsquot replicate the linguistic and cultural nuances of human conversation. In fact, as our survey shows, it can potentially lead to a whole new level of confusion, with phrases lost in translation.  She added: \u0026ldquoUltimately, nobody wants to be stuck staring at their phone screen all holiday, so taking the time to learn a few phrases can pay dividends \u0026ndash not just for a couple of weeks in the summer but in the workplace too.  \u0026ldquoAs the UK repositions itself on the world stage, more of us being able to speak a little of another language will be key to the country\u0026rsquos long\u0026ndashterm competitiveness.

Opposition parties said he was trying to blame others for a mess of his own making, and warned it would be a disaster for the UK to crash out of Europe without a trade and customs relationship with the continent.  Official contingency plans suggest a no deal Brexit could choke ports, create food and medicine shortages, lead to social unrest and torpedo the economy.  Downing Street said it was \u0026ldquoconfident of a good deal, but did not disown Dr Fox\u0026rsquos remarks, which chime with its effort to sell Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit in Europe.  Last week, as part of a Cabinet drive to concentrate minds across the Channel, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the UK and EU were heading a for no deal \u0026ldquoby accident.  Mrs May also interrupted her holiday to meet France\u0026rsquos President Macron to discuss it.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos top negotiator, last week trashed key parts of the Chequers plan, saying it tried to cherry pick parts of long-standing trade and customs arrangements.  Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos had dismissed the proposal, which has split the Tories, simply because \"we have never done it before\", making \u0026ldquothe chance of no deal greater.  He told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI think the intransigence of the [European] Commission is pushing us towards no deal. We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen.  \u0026ldquoBut if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit - not a people\u0027s Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome.\"  He said that if the EU didn\u0026rsquot like the Chequers plan it was down to them to offer one \u0026ldquoacceptable to us.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos up to the EU 27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission\u0026rsquos theological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos essential that no deal looks creible to the EU.  In July 2017, Dr Fox said EU-UK legal and regulatory alignment made a deal easy.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We don\u0026rsquot want to have no deal. It is much better that we have a deal than no deal. We can of course survive with no deal.  Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned on Friday the odds of no-deal were \u0026ldquouncomfortably high, sparking a fall in the value of the pound.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said no deal would be \u0026ldquoa catastrophic failure of government, which no government should survive, and MPs had a duty to prevent it.  He blamed Mrs may\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoreckless red lines on leaving the single market, customs union and European Court of Justice, Tory divisions and \u0026ldquofantasy Brexiteer promises.  SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell tweeted about Dr Fox: \u0026ldquoIt is not astonishing (given his political track record) but it is deeply worrying that he understands so little about the EU.  SNP foreign affairs spokesperson Stephen Gethins MP said: \u0026ldquoFirst it was Jeremy Hunt, then Mark Carney, and now Liam Fox is saying we are likely facing a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo scenario when the UK leaves the EU.  \u0026ldquoThe Tory government\u0026rsquos chaotic handling of the Brexit negotiations, and its ideological red lines, have resulted in small and large businesses already having one foot out the door.  \u0026ldquoWith eight months left before the self-imposed Brexit date, the UK government must commit to remaining in the single market and customs union. There is still time for the government to take a step back and work with the business community and devolved governments to pursue an outcome that safeguards our economy, jobs and living standards.\"  Former Tory minister Priti Patel said Mrs May may should ditch the Chequers plan, which would maintain a \u0026ldquocommon rule book on goods and agri-foods.  The Brexiter MP said it did not fulfill the referendum result and would \u0026ldquoleave us half-in and half-out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints.  In a swipe at the PM, she said \u0026ldquopolitical courage, the kind of courage that appears to have been lacking over the past two years, was required to deliver a loose frade trade deal.  Ina newspaper article, former Labour Home Secretary Lord Blunkett said people who voted Leave over immigration concerns were not \u0026ldquoracist, but had been issuing a \u0026ldquocry for help about the state of the political system and the aftermath of the financial crash on their lives.

These days, it\u0026rsquos the railway that runs past the site of the former Perthshire forest that for many has come to symbolise inertia on a dramatic scale.  In 2008, the First Minister Alex Salmond promised to cut 35 minutes off the train journey between the Central belt and Inverness in four years.  Today, exactly ten years later, campaigners will highlight times have been reduced by an average of just four minutes, and two-thirds of the 118-mile Highland Main Line between Perth and Inverness remains single track.  Meanwhile, over the same decade, work has started on a \u0026pound3bn upgrade to the A9 that follows the same route.  The government quango Transport Scotland says the current aim is to deliver an average rail service lasting three hours, and a \"fastest\" of 2hrs 45 mins, by 2025.  Transform Scotland, which campaigns for sustainable transport, says the government should now make doubling and electrification of the Highland Main Line, a key connection for the far north, a top priority in its new Strategic Transport Projects Review.  The gorup\u0027s Paul Tetlaw said: \"In 2008, Alex Salmond said that within four years the rail journey time would be cut to 2 hrs 45 mins, but a decade later it averages around three and a half hours \u0026ndash yet A9 journeys are getting faster as road dualling.  \u0026ldquoThe public were told that there would be additional rail passing loops and double-tracking, but all that is being delivered is resignalling of two crossing loops.  \u0026ldquoHourly passenger trains and an average journey time saving of 10 minutes are promised but with no additional track it\u0027s highly likely we\u0027ll see more delays and cancellations as more trains are squeezed onto the single track railway.  He said the Borders Railway was a reminder single track sections meant poor performance.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government now needs to deliver serious investment in the railway to ensure there is a level playing field between road and rail.  Ian Budd, of Friends of the Far North Line, said: \u0026ldquoThe Highland Main Line is key to the whole regional rail network. Slow journey times and unreliability between Perth and Inverness have a knock-on impact on connecting trains to the Far North Line, Kyle and Elgin, and discourage people from switching from car to train.  \u0026ldquoRail travellers are entitled to see the Scottish Government deliver on its manifesto promises and make the step-change improvements which Alex Salmond announced 10 years ago.  \u0026ldquoWhat we have at the moment in no way equates with the government\u0027s stated policy.\"  David Spaven, from the Rail Freight Group, added: \u0026lsquoEveryone wants to see fewer 44-tonne trucks on the A9, but the current very limited upgrade to the Highland Main Line offers little or nothing for rail freight.  \u0026ldquoIndeed the worry is that rather than freight shifting from road to rail - the Government\u0026rsquos policy objective - we will see the loss of existing rail traffics, as the A9 gets faster and the single-track railway increasingly congested. That\u0026rsquos economic and environmental madness.  \u0026ldquoWe need longer crossing loops, so that freight trains 40 per cent longer than at present can compete much more effectively with road hauliers.  The Scottish Government said Phase 1 of the Highland Main Line improvements, increasing services from 9 to 11 per day and shaving six minutes off average trips, had been delivered.  However UK cuts meant spending was restrained.  A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoPhase 2 is well underway and aims to deliver an hourly service between Inverness and Perth (continuing to Glasgow or Edinburgh), further journey time reductions of around 10 minutes, and more efficient freight operations by Spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoOur ongoing future investment is truly transforming the rail network and giving passengers and freight users across rural and urban Scotland the best railway they\u0026rsquove ever had.  She blamed the UK Government for a shortfall in funding for 2019-2024 of \"at least \u0026pound460 million short of early industry estimates of costs to deliver the improvements required to meet forecast future demand for services. This means our future investment decisions will need to reflect the financial climate we are faced with as a consequence of decisions taken by the UK Government."},{"url":null,"title":"grandmother-61-is-britains-longest-serving-swimming-lifeguard","story":"  Now 61, it is thought that Joy Cunningham is Britain\u0026rsquos longest serving active lifeguard.

Mrs Cunningham, of Rotherham, Yorkshire, said her only major scare came in November 2016, when she saved the life of an off-duty police officer who collapsed and went into cardiac arrest.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe alarm went off and I thought it was someone having an epileptic fit but it was someone having a heart attack.  \u0026ldquoI had to turn him over \u0026ndash he was blue \u0026ndash and gave him CPR and the defibrillator.

She first became interested in swimming after obtaining a life-saving certificate as part of her Duke of Edinburgh Award.  She then saw a job advert for a recreation assistant in a local newspaper and that\u0026rsquos how she got the job.  \u0026ldquoAt the interview, they said \u0026lsquocan you start on Monday?\u0026rsquo but I hadn\u0026rsquot even left school, she added. \u0026ldquoSo I went to school in the morning and started work in the afternoon.  \u0026ldquoI never really set out to be a lifeguard, I wanted to be a swimming teacher.

As climate change is causing alpine plants to grow at higher altitudes, Dan Watson and Paul Thomson need to take extreme action to make sure they keep their botanical knowledge up to scratch.  They are part of the National Trust for Scotland\u0026rsquos intrepid countryside experts and have just received specialist training in rope access, so they can reach never-before accessed areas and get a better understanding of the plant life that\u0026rsquos found there.  Between them they scour some of the Trust\u0026rsquos most mountainous terrain at Ben Lawers, Glencoe and Mar Lodge Estate and have recently undergone rope training and abseiling in a bid to access more inaccessible areas.  Mr Thomson said: \u0026ldquoThe main target for this work is for botanical surveys of inaccessible areas. For example, we are planning to access crags and gullies in Coire nam Beitheach at Glencoe National Nature Reserve. I monitor a number of rare plants there, but I am certain that there is much to be discovered in even more remote locations.  \u0026ldquoThere are many other locations at both of these properties that we will look at in coming years, but requests are also starting to come in from elsewhere too.  The move is seen as necessary as NTS research shows Scotland\u0026rsquos rare mountain plants are disappearing at an \u0026ldquoalarming rate.  Monitoring has revealed many fragile alpine species are vanishing from areas they used to inhabit and retreating to higher altitudes in response to global warming.  Conservationists say milder, wetter winters, drier springs and a decrease in lying snow are having an impact on plants growing on peaks. Studies at some of the country\u0026rsquos famous beauty spots have revealed major declines.  In some cases, plants have vanished from lower level locations where they had previously thrived. The tiny but fragile Arctic plants, such as Iceland purslane, snow pearlwort and Highland saxifrage, are found only in a handful of locations in the Highlands and islands, clustered in north-facing gullies, coires and crevices, frequently protected by the last pockets of late-lying winter snow.  The move into extreme monitoring comes after a large group of botanists, geologists and mountaineers spent time on ropes surveying unexplored areas of the exposed and often sheer north face of Ben Nevis in a search for similar species.  The survey on the 1,346m mountain led to the discovery of Alpine saxifrage in new locations. The plant had not been detected on Ben Nevis until a survey in 2014.  They also found new populations of Highland saxifrage, as well as the white-flowered Arctic mouse-ear, a plant native to Greenland, Iceland and Norway, and starwort mouse-ear, plus a mystery grass.  But a survey on the Burg peninsula of Mull had found the tiny annual plant was being severely hit by warmer springs, which had also led to increased growth by other plants competing for space.  On Bidean nam Bian next to Glencoe in Argyll, the latest field surveys also found a 50 per cent decline in Highland saxifrage at lower altitudes compared to the numbers detected in 1995.  Mr Watson added: \u0026ldquoOur monitoring shows climate change is affecting Scotland\u0026rsquos mountains at an alarming rate. When you see mountain plants either retreating up the hill or disappearing from their niches, it\u0026rsquos clear evidence that things are changing. The evidence is unequivocal to me that the climate is changing in the mountains."},{"url":null,"title":"geography-no-longer-just-about-books-and-maps-says-michael-palin","story":"  The veteran traveller said the \u0026ldquomagic appeal of the subject lies in exploring your surroundings and being able to \u0026ldquosee and touch and feel what the land is like.  In an interview with the Press Association, Palin said geography is a vital subject in the modern world, \u0026ldquobroadening minds and encouraging an understanding of different countries and cultures.  \u0026ldquoThe world is much more accessible, and I think it is hugely important that we understand the world and why countries are where they are, why live they how they do, what the climate is, what they produce, he said.  \u0026ldquoGeography is no longer just something which you learn from a book and a map and that\u0026rsquos it. It\u0026rsquos very much now a collaborative thing.  \u0026ldquoThe world is out there, you can go and see for yourself, very often now for very small amounts of money, what the world looks like, and I think that\u0026rsquos a great opportunity.  \u0026ldquoI think it broadens the mind \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos one obvious thing, but it also, I think it just helps us to understand how other countries are the way they are, and this is really very important in just helping us to realise that we all share the same planet and we should know more about what makes us different as well as what makes us similar.  Palin\u0026rsquos comments come as Press Association analysis shows that A-level and GCSE geography entries have risen in recent years.  In England alone, GCSE geography entries rose by more than a third (36%) between 2012 and 2017.  The increase is likely to have been fuelled by the introduction of the English Baccalaureate \u0026ndash a government measure which recognises teenagers who study English, maths, science, history or geography and a language at GCSE.  At A-level, the analysis shows that geography entries in England have risen by a fifth (21%) over the same five years.  Palin said field trips are \u0026ldquovery important, adding that this is what first got him interested in the subject.  \u0026ldquoI looked at books, I looked at maps, I looked at atlases, I enjoyed that, but the thing that inspired me most of all was being taken from the school into the local area to look at nature, to look at the way the land looked, to understand the geography, to walk up little hills and streams and see how the ecological system worked, look at the environment.  He added that he believes getting outdoors is \u0026ldquowhere the magic appeal of geography lies, it\u0026rsquos being out there, it\u0026rsquos being able to see and touch and feel what the land is like.  The writer, broadcaster and Monty Python star suggested that the reason for the rise in the popularity of the subject may be partly down to modern technology which allows people to talk to others \u0026ldquoin Argentina, or Sri Lanka, or Norway all in the same morning.  \u0026ldquoI think that helps, that stimulates the curiosity, which is a very important part of learning about the rest of the world.  He added: \u0026ldquoI think people are travelling more, and younger travellers, I think, are demanding something which I think is quite admirable, which is to go to more difficult places and very often to places where they can help in the local communities, which I think is a really important thing, because that\u0026rsquos the human side of geography which is very important."},{"url":null,"title":"ewan-mcgregor-says-acting-has-allowed-him-to-keep-childhood-close","story":"  McGregor, 47, was speaking at the European premiere of his new film Christopher Robin at the BFI Southbank cinema in London.

The Daily  also reported that ministers had complained the EU effectively owed them a good deal under the Lisbon Treaty, and should stop \u0026ldquostalling.  Former Brexit Secretary David Davis warned Brussels would be making a \u0026ldquomassive miscalculation if it thought the UK was bluffing about the possibility of no-deal.  The views of 350 firms were polled by the respected Fraser of Allander Institute last month.  Only a handful reported a positive impact from Brexit, with most saying it was making no difference or having a negative effect.  Asked about the impact on their business, 49 per cent of firms said no change, 44 per cent said a negative change, and just 6 per cent said there had been a positive shift.  A third of firms reported a negative effect on investment activity, compared to 4 per cent positive, and 41 per cent identified a negative effect on new investment ( 3 per cent positive).  A third also said there had been a negative effect on staff recruitment (3 per cent positive).  There was an \u0026ldquooverwhelming feeling of being in the dark about what Brexit would bring.  Asked if they adequate information available to plan for different outcomes of the Brexit talks, 75 per cent said no, 13 per cent said yes, and 13 per cent didn\u0026rsquot know.  The biggest factor affecting preparations was \u0026ldquouncertainty over the UK Government\u0026rsquos objectives in the negotiations, cited by 59 per cent of the businesses surveyed.  However only 5 per cent had sought guidance from government to help with planning.  Looking ahead to life after Brexit, 51 per cent of businesses surveyed said they did not see any immediate benefits, 28 per cent thought fewer EU regulations would be an improvement, and 26 per cent thought it might bring extra funding from the UK or Scottish governments.  Less than one in five thought of new opportunities in markets outside the EU.  Institute director Professor Graeme Roy said it was hard to believe senior UK ministers were openly discussing a no-deal Brexit which would deliver a \u0026ldquosignificant negative hit to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and Scottish jbs, as well as food shortages and log-jams at ports.  He said: \u0026ldquoIrrespective of whether you agree or disagree with the decision to leave the EU, the uncertainty caused by this lack of clarity is making it extremely difficult for businesses to develop contingencies or plan for the future.  \u0026ldquoTwo years on from the referendum outcome, simply kicking the can down the road \u0026ndash or sleep walking into a no-deal - is simply no longer a credible economic strategy to adopt.

This states the Union must \u0026ldquodevelop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness, founded on the values of the Union and characterised by close and peaceful relations based on cooperation.  A senior Whitehall source said that ought to mean the EU responding favourably to the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit instead of digging in over its own red lines.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the Chequers plan, with a common rule book on goods and agri-foods but looser rules on services and migration, is unacceptable cherry picking.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has to know that we are not kidding. If they don\u0026rsquot like our offer they need to come back and say what the alternative is, but they can\u0026rsquot just keep stalling, the source said.  \u0026ldquoThe way they are behaving is making this difficult and if we end up with no deal we will make it clear whose fault it was.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services. They will need some convincing therefore that their interests lie at the heart of these proposals.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 1:37

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Some said the test had prompted otherwise confident five-year-olds to burst into tears and one child had “soiled itself due to the extreme distress”.             Children said things like “I’m no good”, “I can’t do this”, and “Why are you making me do this?” Others were “shaking and crying.” One teacher branded the tests ‘completely useless’ and ‘cruel nonsense,’ saying pupils could get high scores simply by guessing answers.            But the reaction has been strangely hostile. Commentators, experts and some parents have ­dismissed the evidence, insisting that teachers and pushy parents are transmitting their own uncertainties to the kids and traumatised children will quickly recover. Why so harsh?Some SNP supporters treat problems uncovered by political rivals like Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie as manufactured criticism of the Scottish Government. But there’s more.Scots have long experienced and endured hurt at an early age and although smacking’s been banned, a belief still remains that early, tough life lessons “never did us any harm”. This sits beside a deep-seated cultural belief that the three Rs should be hammered into children as ­early as humanly possible.Such withering disbelief flies in the face of the facts. Britain stands alone in ­forcing five year-olds into formal education at all. In 1870, the UK parliament chose an early school starting age so ­mothers could ­provide cheap labour in ­factories. Only 12 per cent of countries worldwide share British practice and they are all are former parts of the British Empire.Malta and Ireland, however, recently joined 66 per cent of the world’s ­countries, which start school at six. Meanwhile 22 per cent of countries including Finland, Estonia and Switzerland have a play-based kindergarten from 3-7. Perhaps that’s why they topped a recent OECD ­international review into education achievement.             According to child psychologist Dr David Whitbread of Cambridge University: “Play is an adaptation which evolved in early human social groups. It enabled humans to become powerful learners and problem-solvers. “Neuroscientific studies have shown that playful activity leads to synaptic growth, particularly in the frontal ­cortex, the part of the brain responsible for all the uniquely human higher mental functions.” In short, if you stifle play you stunt personal growth.Scotland has long talked the language of play, but remained firmly wedded to what’s ae been, with disappointing results. In 2016 Durham and York university academics found Scottish pupils from the most deprived areas were 14 months behind more affluent peers entering primary school. No amount of national testing will change that, but a move away from early “schoolification” just might. Evidence suggests that children taught literacy skills from the age of five do no ­better in the long run than those who start at seven. On the other hand, an early start at school is linked to social, emotional and mental health problems in children forced to begin formal learning before they are ready. This is why the national standardised test at five does such ­damage.Some innovative Scottish teachers have introduced a play-based approach to Primaries 1 and 2. Children’s confidence is slowly built up and a close, trusting relationship develops with the teacher. Then one day the children are handed a tablet and told to do things they have never done, for reasons they can’t understand.             The children can’t step back, as they can in the rest of their play-based lives but must sit for 40 minutes until the task is completed – no matter how they feel. Some are fine. But some are conscious of what they cannot do for the first time, trust with the teacher is broken and confidence collapses. The P1 test forces a clash between two government-backed systems – non-confrontational play and formal, rule-based education. For what?The result may not be traumatic for the majority of children but it isn’t productive either. “Baseline” tests on English five year-olds were introduced twice in the noughties and abandoned because they had “no meaningful value at such an early developmental stage”. Now Theresa May plans to introduce Scottish-style, baseline tests again, prompting the British Educational Research Association to label them “a baseline without basis”. That verdict applies to Scotland too.This is not to say all forms of testing are bad. In world-leading Finland, there is constant observational assessment by teachers who undertake individual, informal tests if there’s a problem. But they are not standardised, not national and not made before the age of six or seven because Finnish five-year-olds are still in kindergarten enjoying play-based learning. In Australia, testing has been conducted for a decade with youngsters of seven and eight – not with five-year-olds.             Professor Sue Palmer, founder of Upstart Scotland, says “after ­primary four there are evidence-based arguments both ways about the value of testing. In primary one there are none at all. National standardised testing runs totally counter to the Curriculum for Excellence and nips in the bud the growing move towards play in the early years. It encourages teaching to the test, ­narrows the curriculum and changes the relationship between teachers and children – particularly damaging for disadvantaged children.” The urge to stuff education into five-year-old brains may be understandable but it’s not rational, helpful or kind. Willie Rennie wants to abolish P1 tests. He concludes: “If [this policy] continues it will be because ministers are more interested in saving face than giving children the best start to their schooling.”It’ll be hard for the Scottish Government to admit its mistake – but harder still if progressive parents and teachers conclude that Willie Rennie is right."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779453.1533560167!/image/image.jpg","title":"vic valentine why children should learn about trans people in school","story":"        Challenging gender stereotypes in schools is crucial to give all children and young people the tools they need to navigate a world that has many unspoken rules and expectations around gender that are taken for granted.                 It is important that amongst these lessons is an introduction to trans people – people whose sense of their gender does not match up with what we might have expected based on what our bodies looked like when we were born.            Recognising that some people are trans is an important part of challenging gender stereotypes – which are all rooted in the idea that the body you are born with defines who you are and who you can be.            Not teaching children the fact that some people are trans does not make us all magically disappear. READ MORE: Primary one children will be told ‘your gender is what you decide’Pupils may be attending school with a classmate who has a trans parent, with an older sibling who is trans, or may even be trans themselves. It is not the inclusion of trans people, but in fact silence within schools about our existence that is much more likely to cause confusion. This silence leaves some children and young people without the knowledge they need to embrace the real diversity they will encounter in the world.

Mr Yousaf, who was promoted to the role in June, hit out as legal action to prevent the eviction of asylum seekers got under way.            Housing and homeless charity Shelter Scotland is taking action after accommodation provider Serco issued notices to say it planned to change the locks in cases where asylum applications have been refused and tenants have not moved on.            While Serco announced on Saturday it will pause the rolling programme of lock changes ahead of the court case, Mr Yousaf said this would only provide “temporary relief” for those at risk of losing their home.READ MORE: Serco boss ‘doesn’t know’ how many former asylum seekers will be evictedFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already spoken out against the proposals and Mr Yousaf, MSP for Glasgow Pollok, said he was “very concerned” about Serco’s actions.He said: “I welcome, of course, that Serco have announced a recent halting, but that is just a temporary relief undoubtedly for aslum seekers.“I would echo the First Minister that some much-needed humanity has to be injected into the system.            “The Home Office immigration and asylum policy has rightly been criticised for being too cruel, for not seeing human beings, for not understanding the reasons why people leave their homes, whether it is war, poverty or conflict.“There are some real big hurdles in the asylum process, but there is a complete and utter lack of humanity in the system from the UK Government, and that has to change.”As well as legal action, Serco’s plans have sparked protests in Glasgow, a city which has become home to many of those seeking refuge.While Mr Yousaf said he could not comment on the legal proceedings, the Justice Secretary added: “Legality aside, there is clearly a desire from the people of Glasgow that they want and are happy for asylum seekers to make Glasgow their home and for refugees to make Glasgow their home.            “That is why we call on the Home Office to take a much more humane approach to government.“The UK Government could change the legislation around this, if they don’t want to do that we’ve often said as the Scottish Government they should hand the powers over immigration and asylum to the Scottish Government.”He spoke out after the head of Serco said he did not know how many people housed by the firm in Glasgow would be evicted.However, chief executive Rupert Soames said it was not true lock change notices would be issued to 330 people.Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: “That is the total number of people we are paying for whom Home Office support has ceased.            “About of third of them have had positive decisions and will be waiting for a month or six weeks or eight weeks to find alternative arrangements and go on and make their lives with legal right to remain, and nobody is going to want to make them homeless.”Questioned on the figures regarding who would be given lock change notices, he said: “We don’t know, because a number of them, hopefully, will move on.“We have been looking after, at our expense, people for over two years.“There are 80 people who have had negative decisions, who are meant to leave the country who we still pay the rent, rate, heating, light for.”Serco has made an £80 million loss on the asylum accommodation contract in the past five years, Mr Soames said.The firm has welcomed the legal action as an opportunity to gain clarity from the courts, although it insisted its approach was “fully within the law”."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nTuesday 7 Aug 2018 1:37 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It was a fantastic opportunity to meet with like-minded individuals and share information regarding our available resources and capabilities. We are looking to make this a regular occurrence which will benefit all agencies. Recruitment was also a priority for the agencies and we are keen to encourage new, keen local individuals to become part of our emergency services family. We look forward to hearing from interested members of the public who may become valuable members of the emergency services in the future.”\nAs far as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is concerned, Mr. Colliar said anyone is welcome to drop in when training is taking place at Skye fire stations. Dunvegan, Portree, Staffin and Raasay train between 7 pm and 9 pm every Monday, as does Raasay, while Uig is on a Tuesday evening and Broadford on Wednesday. Those stations will also be open to the public on the weekend of 28th and 29th July between 10 am and 2 pm. The service is looking for retained firefighters across Skye and Raasay.\nThe Skye Mountain Rescue Team, British Red Cross and the Maritime Agency Coastguard are currently looking for volunteers and can be contacted locally or through their respective websites. The Scottish Ambulance Service is actively recruiting, and applications are through their website. Police Scotland would be keen to speak to individuals interested in the role of Special Constable locally and can be contacted at Portree police station or online via their website.\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/calmac-pic.jpg","title":"uig regeneration council to","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nHighland Council are to consult on a development brief for Uig in north Skye, which is designed to transform the area over the next 20 years.\nA key part of the strategy is to identify and coordinate regeneration opportunities which may arise from Transport Scotland\u0026#8217s investment in the Skye Triangle ferry routes, including the port facilities at Uig.\nThe consultation starts on Monday 30th July and runs until Friday 21st September.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Historywas clearly being made.\nSomeyears later in 2004 as Sinn Féin\u0027s Northern Chairperson Iproposed we invite an ANC representative to Ireland as part of the Cúige’s Céad (centenary) celebrations.\nThe Cúigeleadership agreed.\nBy thenRonnie Kasrils was the South African Minister of Intelligence.\nSo Ichanced my arm and sent off a letter more in vain hope than any realexpectation.\nRemarkablyRonnie wrote back accepting our invitation to visit Ireland, and, would do soas a representative of Thabo Mbeki’s government.\nNeedlessto say we were delighted (and, the Cúige had just been saved a fortune of moneyin plane fares!)\nAtremendously successful programme of events was organised and Ronnie Kasrilshad a big impact everywhere he visited and spoke.\nHe andother South African comrades returned the following year to share the ANC’sexperience of transition in government as we launched the big debate within therepublican base on policing.\nVerymany comrades have vivid memories of Ronnie’s contribution to our internalpolitical discussions during this period.\nHe alsoattended and addressed Ard Fheiseanna with his then wife Eleanor and thenafter her untimely death in 2009 he wrote a brilliant book about her own rolein the liberation struggle entitled the ‘Unlikley Secret Agent’.\nHislatest book ‘A Simple Man’ is a compelling critique of current day SouthAfrica.\nRonniewas a senior figure in the collective leadership of the ANC MK, or Unkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) and the South African Communist Party, as well asa Deputy Minister of Defence, and later Minister of Intelligence in SouthAfrica.\nThe newbook provides an analysis of the ANC’s transition from resistance to powerwhich is essential reading for all political activists.\nJoeSlovo, the former MK Chief of Staff, said to Ronnie Kasrils towards the end of1994 that very few people had enjoyed the unique privilege of serving in aliberation struggle and then in government as they had.\nAs acommitted internationalist he has consistently stood in support of the peopleof Palestine, Cuba and freedom loving people across the world.\nHe hasmade an important contribution to the Basque peace process.\nAlongwith others in South Africa he has strongly supported the Irish peace process,and Sinn Féin’s work to achieve an agreed, united Ireland.\nDuringtwo speaking engagements in Belfast and Derry he kept the audiences enthralledwith his political analysis. They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics. The humanity of your peopleand their commitment is so tremendous.\nWe allneed to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadershipand determination.\nHeroworship is something altogether different. That’s the stuff of sycophancy andthe notion that the celebration of personality is the end itself.\nThephrase that “we stand on the shoulders of giants” refers to those who have gonebefore us, but left a legacy of inspiration and leadership by example.\nThisSunday the National Hunger Strike commemoration will take place inCastlewellan, County Down.\n\nTheIrish Hunger strikers are now among a pantheon of iconic Irish andinternational figures who symbolise the struggle for a better world alongsidethe leaders of 1916 Mary Ann McCracken Nelson Mandela Ché Guevaraand Ho Chi Minh.\nBertoltBrecht the socialist poet wrote:\n      “There are those who struggle for a day and that is good\n                There are those whostruggle for a year and that is better\n                And there are those who struggle for twenty tears and that is better still\n  Then there are thosewho struggle all their lives, and they are the ones we cannot do without”\nRonnieKasrils continues to politically campaign enthusiastically for a better worldeven while approaching the autumn of his life.\nThestruggle for Irish unity, independence, and an Ireland of equals has beenenriched by his friendship and solidarity.\nSinn Féin and other progressives inIreland are proud to call him our comrade and our friend.    \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27434  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“The vibrant, colourful and loud message from today’s Belfast Pride parade is that the ‘north is next’ and Sinn Féin will continue to campaign to ensure that this becomes a reality.” - Megan Fearon MLA\nSinn Féin joined thousands of people on the streets of Belfast today for the annual Belfast Pride finale in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. \nThe parade – led by the Belfast Pride Festival and Mayor of Belfast Deirdre Hargey – started at Custom House Square, made its way past City Hall and through Belfast City Centre. \n\nColourful banners and floats from businesses, community organisations, political parties, emergency services and campaign groups such as Love Equality joined the procession. \nThere was a clear message from today’s parade, there is a demand for equality for the LGBTQ+ community twinned with mass opposition to the DUP’s denial of marriage equality. \n, Sinn Féin Equality spokesperson, Megan Fearon MLA said pride is a display of ‘unity and determination’ to achieve equality. \n“It’s really important that we are all together here today to fight for equality of opportunity under the law. \n“Equality for all our citizens, but especially for our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

whittled down to 32 who will appear on RTE for television interviews.\n  \nIf Roisin is one of the lucky 32 she said the television interview with Daithi will not make her nervous.\n  \nMy business is all about teaching children how to be confident and outgoing in public so I think I will be ok in the interview if I am lucky enough to get that far.\n  \nRoisin will play a selected piece of music on her custom made tin whistle which was presented to her by Killarney Whistle.\n  \nShe will also be presented with exquisite jewellery from Tipperary Crystal to match her gowns for the festival.\n  \nRoisin\u0027s mum, dad, two brothers and three sisters plan to travel to Tralee to cheer her on along with the extended family.\n  \nRoisin concluded: I would love to win the festival but most of

enterprise programme aimed at boosting jobs and business in the borough.\n  \nThe Exploring Enterprise 4 Programme, delivered under the European Social fund (ESF) Programme 2014-2020, will be managed by Enterprise Northern Ireland and rolled out locally by LEDCOM and Carrickfergus Enterprise.\n  \nThe Exploring Enterprise Programme is a free special support initiative aimed at helping unemployed or economically inactive individuals improve their employment prospects as well as exploring potential self-employment opportunities.\n  \nThe course provides one-to-one tailored business mentoring support, with the opportunity to work towards achieving an accredited QCF Level 1 Qualification in Understanding Business Enterprise.\n  \nParticipants will get the opportunity to visit local businesses and work as part of a team to develop business skills and knowledge.\n  \nThrough Amplify, the integrated economic strategy for the borough, Council is committed to growing the economy whilst focusing on developing and supporting entrepreneurial activity across Mid and East Antrim.\n  \nCllr Lindsay Millar, Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, said: “Our Council is focused on supporting the business growth journey to enable businesses to create jobs and wealth throughout the borough.\n  \n“Earlier this year Council launched an exciting new strategy to boost the economy across the borough, called ‘Amplify’.\n  \n“Amplify aims to support the development of Mid and East Antrim right through until 2030.\n  \n“Growing the economy is Council’s top priority in Mid and East Antrim and Amplify allows us to support a number of businesses from the start-up to growth phases.\n  \n“The support and opportunities available from the new business programmes offered through ‘Amplify’ help to create a vibrant business culture within our borough.\n  \n“We are blessed with an abundance of talent throughout our borough and it is crucial we work together to harness those skills and potential by providing practical advice and guidance for start-ups and established businesses.”\n  \nMichael McQuillan, Chief Executive of Enterprise Northern Ireland, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for participants who are experiencing challenges or facing barriers to entering or returning to the labour market, to gain an understanding of enterprise and become employment or self-employment ready.\n  \n“While being provided with the opportunity to explore self-employment as an option, the participant can work towards a recognised qualification in Understanding Business. This endorsement professionalises their engagement in the programme and is something they will always have to evidence their capability, as they build a career in enterprise.”\n  \nThis project is part-funded through the Northern Ireland European Social Fund Programme 2014 – 2020, the Department for the Economy, and Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.\n  \nFor more information on the Exploring Enterprise Programme or other business support in Mid and East Antrim, contact: amplify@midandeast\n  \nantrim.gov.uk\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk28026-8492781.jpg","title":"65215  ","story":"    \nTHOUSANDS of mourners are expected to make the pilgrimage to Garryduff Presbyterian Church in Ballymoney on Wednesday to pay their respects to William Dunlop.\nFuneral arrangements have been put in place for the 32-year-oldmotorcyclist who tragically lost his life after an accident during a practice session for the Skerries 100 road races on Saturday, July 7.\nThe popular Ballymoney man was involved in an incident at the Sam\u0027s Tunnel section of the County Dublin circuit.\nThe Funeral Service in Garryduff Presbyterian Church will take place on Wednesday at 1pm followed by interment in the adjoining churchyard.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

John Kirkpatrick paid testament to William\u0027s character.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the other work. I was always a member of the Christian Brother’s camera club on the Antrim Road and owe them a lot.\n“I hope those who are coming will appreciate the work.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37184302.ece/7cf68/AUTOCROP/w140square/Belfast_Pride-006.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37188107.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Landing%20%202_Lewis.jpg","title":"belfast airport emergency declared on flybe flight plane lands with one engine","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein urge electoral office rethink on just three centres for ian paisley recall petition","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table. They need to make clear that agreements must be implemented in full.\"\n\nMs McDonald added that the DUP\u0027s \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Tories continued to be a sticking point in getting the Assembly\u0027s institutions restored.\n\n\"We are dealing with a British Government that is dependent on DUP votes and sees Ireland as collateral damage in their desire to remain in office,\" she added. \"That is why we need a strong Irish Government leading on these issues.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"15m euro boost for irish olympic preparations after","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

To be clear again no apologies - on either side. \npic.twitter/zDogfyk9LV\n\n— Margaret Hodge (@margarethodge) \nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation into her conduct followed a heated exchange last month in which she was said to have called Mr Corbyn and an “anti-Semite” and a “racist” over his refusal to adopt in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.\n\nIn a letter from her lawyers Mishcon de Reya, posted on social media by Dame Margaret, they accused Ms Formby of misrepresenting her position in a “cynical attempt to save face in your necessary climbdown”.\n\nThe letter said it was over two weeks since Dame Margaret had spoken to Mr Brown about the matter and that they had had no further discussions since.\n\n“She did not express regret – in those or any other words,” the letter said.\n\n“As you are aware, our client will not apologise for her conduct and words, as she did nothing wrong.\n\n“You have entirely misrepresented our client’s discussions with the opposition chief whip in a cynical attempt to save face in your necessary climbdown.”\n\n\nI’m pleased that the Labour Party has finally dropped their ‘action’ against me. After 55 years of LP membership going after me instead of addressing the issue was wrong. In 2018 anti Semitism that has again reared its ugly head and the campaign against it goes on. 1/2\n— Margaret Hodge (@margarethodge) \nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nGideon Falter, of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said the decision to drop the inquiry against her was a “humiliating capitulation” by the party.\n\n“The entire Jewish community was disgusted by the way that Dame Margaret was victimised simply for confronting anti-Semitism in the Labour Party,” he said.\n\n“We applaud her for standing up against anti-Semitism in the party and for refusing to bow to the considerable pressure put on her to apologise.”\n\nThe decision to drop the inquiry comes after deputy leader Tom Watson called for the investigations into Dame Margaret and a second Labour MP Ian Austin – who clashed with party chairman Ian Lavery over the issue – to be abandoned.\n\nHis comments, warning the party faced a “vortex of eternal shame” unless it tackled anti-Semitism within its ranks, prompted a furious Twitter campaign to oust him under the hashtag #ResignWatson.\n\n\nIt sometimes feels like people have been calling for me to stand down from day one but I never, ever thought I’d be facing demands to \n#resignwatson\n for standing up for people who are facing prejudice and hate.\n— Tom Watson (@tom_watson) \nAugust 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\nEarlier the party confirmed George McManus, a member of Labour’s national policy forum, had been suspended following a Facebook posting referring to Mr Watson and “Jewish donors” and comparing him to Judas.\n\nMr McManus subsequently removed the comments and apologised to Mr Watson and the Jewish community.\n\nWriting on his Facebook page, Mr McManus said Mr Watson had received “£50,000+ from Jewish donors”, adding: “At least Judas only got 30 pieces of silver”.\n\nHis comments were condemned by Labour backbencher Wes Streeting who called them a “100% a classic antisemitic trope”.\n\nAfter deleting the original remarks, Mr McManus wrote: “I’d like to apologise to Tom Watson and to the Jewish community for my drawing an analogy between him accepting money from Jewish donors and the biblical story of the betrayal by Judas.\n\n“I fully accept that such an analogy is wrong and am sorry for making the comparison.”\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said: “The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.\n\n“Complaints about anti-Semitism are always fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

The US withdrew from the disastrous nuclear agreement to negotiate a new deal that makes the world safer. We are determined to change Iran’s threatening behavior \u0026 keep them from ever becoming a nuclear nation. \npic.twitter/9oq0lUN2j6\n\n— Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) \nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“We’re hopeful that we can find a way to move forward but it’s going to require enormous change on the part of the Iranian regime,” he said. “They’ve got to behave like a normal country. That’s the ask. It’s pretty simple.”\n\nEuropean foreign ministers said they “deeply regret” the reimposition of US sanctions.\n\nA statement by European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom insisted that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal “is working and delivering on its goal” of limiting Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nThe ministers said the Iran deal is “crucial for the security of Europe, the region and the entire world”.\n\n\n\n#IranDeal\n: EU to shield EU companies from re-imposed US sanctions \nhttps://t.co/JVs6qW1NuO\n\n— European External Action Service - EEAS 🇪🇺 (@eu_eeas) \nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nA senior administration official said the United States is “not particularly concerned” by EU efforts to protect European firms from the reimposition of sanctions.\n\nThe European Union issued a “blocking statute” to protect European businesses from the impact of the sanctions.\n\nThe official says the US will use the sanctions aggressively and cited Iran’s severe economic downturn this year as evidence the sanctions would prove to be effective despite opposition from the EU, China and Russia.\n\nMr Pompeo called the Iranian leadership “bad actors” and said Mr Trump is intent on getting them to “behave like a normal country”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry republican report psni older peoples commissioner ongoing raids elderly mothers home","story":"\nA Derry Republican whose elderly mother’s house has been raided by police twice this summer said he is reporting the incidents to the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland.\n\nPaddy McFadden’s mother is 77 and is bed bound and suffers from dementia and Alzheimer’s.\n\nHer house in Carnhill was raided by police on Friday and her grandson, who lives at a separate address in Carnhill, was arrested.\n\nPaddy McFadden lives at the address in Carnhill with mother, his sister and her daughter.\n\nThe house was previously raided by police on June 4 and Mr McFadden alleges on that occasion police stopped his mother’s carers from entering the property.\n\n“They just come in and take over the house,” said Mr McFadden.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241013\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“The last time they stopped the carers coming in and they also stopped my wife, who is my mother’s carer, from going in.”\n\nMr McFadden said that because of the raid on Friday his mother was late for a hospital appointment.\n\n“She was able to say to the carer ‘you know the police were here’.\n\n“She was upset and the carers had a bit of work to do to get her ready for a scan at the hospital and she ended up being late.”\n\nMr McFadden said he has sought solicitor’s advice about what happened and said he will be lodging a complaint with the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Derry News contacted the PSNI about the incident but they did not make a comment.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"make pro store opens new branch foyleside shopping centre derry following investment","story":"\nLeading cosmetic retailer Make Up Pro Store has opened a brand-new state of the art store in Derry. \n\nThe business, founded by award-winning makeup artist Paddy McGurgan, has moved from its premises on Pump Street to a 1,600 sq ft space in Foyleside Shopping Centre, following an investment of £50,000.\n\nThe new store will not only act as a cosmetic store but additionally as a makeup training academy.
